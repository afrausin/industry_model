Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAppropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u009d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The September projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on September 16-17, 2025.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\nReturn to table\n3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.\nReturn to table\n4.

Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAppropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u009d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 17-18, 2025.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2.

Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAppropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u009d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The March projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on March 18-19, 2025.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2.

The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as \u00e2\u0080\u009cbroadly similar\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as \u00e2\u0080\u009cbroadly balanced\u00e2\u0080\u009d would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric.

Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAppropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u009d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The December projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on December 17\u00e2\u0080\u009318, 2024.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\nReturn to table\n3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.\nReturn to table\n4.

The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as \u00e2\u0080\u009cbroadly similar\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as \u00e2\u0080\u009cbroadly balanced\u00e2\u0080\u009d would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric.

Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAppropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u009d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The September projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on September 17\u00e2\u0080\u009318, 2024.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 11\u00e2\u0080\u009312, 2024.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2.

Each participant's projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \"Appropriate monetary policy\" is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The March projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on March 19\u00e2\u0080\u009320, 2024. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the March 19\u00e2\u0080\u009320, 2024, meeting.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\nReturn to table\n3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.\nReturn to table\n4.

The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as \"broadly similar\" to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as \"broadly balanced\" would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately sy",

Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAppropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u009d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The December projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on December 12\u00e2\u0080\u009313, 2023. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the December 12\u00e2\u0080\u009313, 2023, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the March 19\u00e2\u0080\u009320, 2024, meeting.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2.

Each participant's projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \"Appropriate monetary policy\" is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The September projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on September 19\u00e2\u0080\u009320, 2023. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the September 19\u00e2\u0080\u009320, 2023, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the December 12\u00e2\u0080\u009313, 2023, meeting.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\nReturn to table\n3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.\nReturn to table\n4.

Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \"Appropriate monetary policy\" is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 13-14, 2023. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the June 13-14, 2023, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the September 19-20, 2023, meeting.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\nReturn to table\n3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.\nReturn to table\n4.

Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \"Appropriate monetary policy\" is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The March projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on March 21\u00e2\u0080\u009322, 2023. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the March 21\u00e2\u0080\u009322, 2023, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the June 13\u00e2\u0080\u009314, 2023, meeting.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\nReturn to table\n3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.\nReturn to table\n4.

Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAppropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u009d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The December projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on December 13-14, 2022. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the December 13-14, 2022, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the March 21-22, 2023, meeting.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\nReturn to table\n3.

Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The September projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on September 20-21, 2022. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the September 20-21, 2022, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the December 13-14, 2022, meeting.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\nReturn to table\n3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.\nReturn to table\n4.

Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAppropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u009d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 14-15, 2022.** One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the June 14-15, 2022, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the September 20-21, 2022, meeting.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\nReturn to table\n3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.\nReturn to table\n4. Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.\nReturn to table\n*On September 21, 2022, in the HTML version of Table 1 the June projections were incorrectly labelled as December projections.

Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAppropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u009d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The March projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on March 15\u00e2\u0080\u009316, 2022. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the March 15\u00e2\u0080\u009316, 2022, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the June 14\u00e2\u0080\u009315, 2022, meeting.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\nReturn to table\n3.

Each participant's projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy--including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value--and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \"Appropriate monetary policy\" is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The September projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on September 21-22, 2021. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the September 21-22, 2021, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the December 14-15, 2021, meeting.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\nReturn to table\n3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.\nReturn to table\n4.

Each participant's projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy--including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value--and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \"Appropriate monetary policy\" is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 15-16, 2021. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the June 15-16, 2021, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the September 21-22, 2021, meeting.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\nReturn to table\n3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.\nReturn to table\n4.

Each participant's projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy--including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value--and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \"Appropriate monetary policy\" is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The March projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on March 16-17, 2021. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the March 16-17, 2021, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the June 15-16, 2021, meeting.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\nReturn to table\n3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.\nReturn to table\n4.

Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels.

Each participant's projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \"Appropriate monetary policy\" is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The December projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on December 15\u00e2\u0080\u009316, 2020. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the December 15\u00e2\u0080\u009316, 2020, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the March 16\u00e2\u0080\u009317, 2021, meeting.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\nReturn to table\n3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.\nReturn to table\n4. Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.\nReturn to table\nFigure 1.

Each participant's projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \"Appropriate monetary policy\" is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nBeginning with the December 2020 FOMC meeting, all Summary of Economic Projections charts and tables previously released with the minutes of a meeting will be released following the conclusion of an FOMC meeting. That is, the release of the distribution of participants' projections (Figures 3.A. through 3.E.), participants' assessments of uncertainty and risks associated with the projections (Figures 4.A. though 4.C. and Figure 5), and Table 2 and associated box, which describe projection error ranges, have been accelerated by three weeks. Two new exhibits, Figures 4.D. and 4.E., have been added to further enhance the information provided on uncertainty and risks by showing how FOMC participants' assessments of uncertainties and risks have evolved over time.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The September projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on September 15\u00e2\u0080\u009316, 2020. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the September 15\u00e2\u0080\u009316, 2020, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the December 15\u00e2\u0080\u009316, 2020, meeting.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\nReturn to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\nReturn to table\n3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.\nReturn to table\n4.
