Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the
Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the in-
terest rates on required and excess reserve balances to
0.15 percent. Setting the interest rate paid on required
and excess reserve balances 15 basis points above the
bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate is
intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at
rates well within the Federal Open Market Committee’s
target range and to support the smooth functioning of
short-term funding markets. The Board of Governors
also voted unanimously to approve establishment of the
primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent,
effective June 17, 2021.
It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, July 27–
28, 2021. The meeting adjourned at 10:40 a.m. on
June 16, 2021.
Notation Vote
By notation vote completed on May 18, 2021, the Com-
mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com-
mittee meeting held on April 27–28, 2021.
