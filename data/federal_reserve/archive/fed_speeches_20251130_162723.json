Jefferson\nAt the 2025 Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Financial Stability Conference, Cleveland, Ohio\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Director Knotek, for the kind introduction. It is a pleasure to be with you today and to be back in Cleveland and the beautiful Fourth district.\n1\nIt is always a pleasure to visit the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\u00e2\u0080\u0094and all the Reserve Banks. The hard work and dedication of Reserve Bank staff, leadership, and directors help ensure the economic well-being of communities across the country, including in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky. One of the many important roles the Reserve Banks have is to be the connection between policymakers and families, workers, and businesses in every corner of the country. That allows us to be well-informed and to make the best decisions for the benefit of all Americans. I thank everyone here at the Cleveland Fed for their service.\nslide 1\nAs we are gathered to discuss financial stability in an era of rapid economic and technological transformation, I would like to turn our attention to what many see as a significant catalyst of change: artificial intelligence (AI). Today, I will talk about\nhow I approach thinking about AI\n. First, I will build on remarks I gave earlier this month and discuss how I see AI affecting the economy through the lens of the dual mandate given to the Federal Reserve by Congress to pursue maximum employment and price stability.\n2\nNext, I will discuss AI in the context of financial stability because a stable and resilient financial system is, of course, critical to achieve that dual mandate. I will do so by highlighting some of the findings in our recently released\nFinancial Stability Report\n(FSR). And finally, I will discuss how the current period compares with another recent period of notable technological change\u00e2\u0080\u0094the late 1990s. Afterwards, I would be happy to answer your questions.\nAI technology has been advancing at an extraordinary pace in recent years.\n3\nHundreds of millions of people now regularly use AI to write and translate documents, obtain practical guidance on a variety of topics, and search for information.\n4\nA recent report from the St. Louis Fed showed that in August almost 55 percent of working-age adults said they used\ngenerative AI\nfor personal or work use, up notably from a year earlier.\n5\nBusinesses are increasingly adopting AI, with use cases clearly moving from the experimentation phase to operations. In the financial industry, AI adoption rates are even higher.\n6\nAnd while it may take some time before we see its full effects, many believe that AI has the potential to generate substantial change across the economy and to be a valuable tool for people all around the world.\n7\nAI and the Dual Mandate\nI see, as many others do, the promise for AI technology to be transformative, perhaps in ways as dramatic as past technological achievements, such as the printing press, steam engine, and the internet. When I think about the macroeconomic consequences of AI, I consider how it will affect both sides of our dual mandate.\nAI can enable a worker to complete in seconds or a few minutes tasks that previously took many minutes, if not hours. Already, it is boosting worker productivity in a wide range of industries and occupations, including customer service, logistics, computer programming, and medical research. Increased productivity leads to economic growth, which may also create new employment opportunities. There is already robust competition among high-tech firms for workers who possess the skills to develop and effectively deploy this technology.\nAt the same time, many people have legitimate concerns that AI will cause job loss. At least for certain firms and workers in certain occupations, this is likely to be true. Indeed, some large employers have recently indicated they are lowering overall hiring plans in light of advances in AI and other forms of automation.\n8\nSome research has also suggested that AI is having a more detrimental effect on the job prospects of younger, less-experienced workers, including recent graduates, compared with those further along in their careers.\n9\nThe net effect on employment is highly uncertain and may show variation across industries and occupations over time. For the overall economy, one way to think about AI-related job losses\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least until it creates new jobs\u00e2\u0080\u0094is that AI can create economic slack. In a world where firms only deployed AI to replace existing workers, even at a lower level of overall employment, the productive capacity of the economy has increased (or stayed the same). Of course, if people get redeployed to more productive tasks, the economy produces more without any additional slack. Whether AI substitutes for labor or complements it is an important question that requires continued study.\nOn the other side of our dual mandate\u00e2\u0080\u0094price stability\u00e2\u0080\u0094AI could help the economy achieve higher growth through increased productivity while reducing inflationary pressures. Specifically, increased productivity could lower production costs and put downward pressure on prices. Not only could AI allow a specific worker to be more efficient in their day-to-day tasks, but it also has the potential to allow for better thinking around complex problems. More efficient allocation of resources as well as potential improvements in supply chains could reduce associated costs, leading to lower prices for various goods and services. Conversely, AI could put upward pressure on certain price categories as many firms push to scale up the technology. I mentioned the rising wages for certain workers with skills that complement AI. AI technology also requires data centers, which compete with other production processes for land, energy, and other inputs. As with the labor market, the timing and degree of AI's effect on prices are uncertain and should be monitored.\nIn terms of AI's implications for monetary policy, it is likely still too soon to tell. Policymakers must sort out changes in the economy that are due to cyclical factors from those resulting from structural change, which AI may well represent. Productivity gains from AI may affect the relationship between employment and inflation and, hence, the conduct of monetary policy. Monetary policy decisions, of course, need to be made with a broad view of what is happening in the economy, not just in one sector or technology. There is still much to learn. I counsel exercising humility about the challenges in predicting AI's effects on employment and inflation.\nAI and Financial Stability\nNow, I will turn to discussing AI through the lens of financial stability. But first I would like to step back and briefly offer my overall assessment. The financial system remains sound and resilient, with high levels of risk appetite and leverage at hedge funds balanced by strong household and business balance sheets and high levels of capital in the banking system. Because the continued resilience of the financial system is so important to achieving our dual-mandate goals, policymakers monitor a range of indicators associated with vulnerabilities, as is discussed in our semiannual FSR. The latest version of that report was published a few weeks ago.\n10\nAs part of our financial stability monitoring work at the Fed, we routinely survey market contacts regarding\npotential risks\nto the U.S. financial system. A finding in the most recent survey is likely of particular interest to a conference exploring financial stability in a time of technological change\u00e2\u0080\u009430 percent of contacts surveyed cited a turn in the prevailing sentiment toward AI as a salient risk to the U.S. financial system and the global economy. That was up from 9 percent in the spring survey. Participants noted that if such an unwinding were to occur, it could tighten financial conditions and restrain economic activity more broadly. It is not my intention to make a judgement on the likelihood of those, or other scenarios offered in the FSR. Rather, I want to reiterate that I am monitoring the scenarios.\nSome observers have asked about\ncomparisons with the late 1990s\n, which was another period when promising new technological advances were closely tied to strong stock market performance.\n11\nThey have asked, are we experiencing \"dot-com boom 2.0?\" So, in the rest of my talk, I will address this question. I will argue that there are important differences between the recent period and the stock market experience during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. Of course, much has changed over the past quarter-century, so history can only be a useful reference and not a predictor of future outcomes.\nHow Current Conditions Compare with the Dot-Com Era\nI see clear differences across the two periods. Before I discuss three notable differences, let me first refresh our memory and mention a dimension along which the dot-com era and the AI era are similar\u00e2\u0080\u0094the particularly rapid stock price appreciation of firms that encapsulate the promise of transformational technologies.\n12\nIndeed, the stock prices of dot-com firms increased more than 200 percent during their boom between 1996 and 1999, a little faster than the increase we have seen so far in the stock prices of AI-related firms since 2022.\n13\nA closer inspection of the firms driving the stock price increases, however, reveals the first critical difference in the stock market dynamics across the two periods. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, many, albeit not all, dot-com firms typically had little to no realized earnings and only speculative revenue prospects even as they obtained external funding and were listed on public exchanges with relative ease amid pronounced investor enthusiasm. In contrast, the firms most closely identified with AI technologies in today's market generally have well-established and growing earnings streams.\nThe second difference is that because of their solid earnings base, the price-to-earnings ratios of AI-related firms have thus far remained well below the peak ratios of dot-com firms in the late 1990s and early 2000s. During the dot-com episode, investors were apparently far more willing to bet on the promise of the internet, with dot-com stocks commanding far larger premiums than AI stocks do today.\nThe third difference is that the proliferation of dot-com firms in the late 1990s and early 2000s suggests a less discriminating enthusiasm than what we are observing in today's market. At the peak in the late 1990s, more than 1,000 firms were publicly listed as dot-com companies, with many having minimal revenue and highly speculative business models. Indeed, researchers have shown that the mere addition of \"dot-com\" to a company name was sufficient to boost the stock price of the firm.\n14\nBy contrast, in the current environment, by one measure about 50 publicly traded firms are considered to be AI-focused enterprises, in the sense that they are expected to derive revenue from other firms using AI technologies, as opposed to the broad-based speculation that we saw in the late 1990s.\n15\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that the rapid growth of private capital markets\u00e2\u0080\u0094which are not publicly traded\u00e2\u0080\u0094in recent years may obscure the extent of investor enthusiasm for financing AI firms, as a growing number of private firms reportedly now identify as AI-focused or AI-native enterprises.\nFinally, with respect to financial leverage, both dot-com previously and AI firms recently exhibited limited reliance on debt financing for the most part. This more limited use of leverage may reduce the extent to which a shift in sentiment toward AI could transmit to the broader economy through credit markets. That said, recent market reports suggest that AI firms may be increasing their use of debt, from both public and private credit markets, to fund substantial investments in computing infrastructure and talent acquisition. Just a few weeks ago, large volumes of corporate bonds were issued to support AI infrastructure buildout by key players in the industry. Some analysts estimate that future investments in AI infrastructure will require a lot more debt.\n16\nIf that turns out to be the case, leverage in the AI sector could increase\u00e2\u0080\u0094and so could the losses if sentiment toward AI shifts. I will watch this developing trend closely.\nIn sum, looking at these dimensions, as of now, the differences between the current market and the dot-com era make it less likely that we are witnessing a replay of the late 1990s. Most notably, in contrast with the dot-com era, the current AI-related stock market activity appears more concentrated among established firms with actual earnings. Additionally, these developments are occurring against the backdrop of a financial system that is sound and resilient.\nConclusion\nTo\nconclude\n, it is important to acknowledge that assessing the implications of rapidly developing technology for financial stability is subject to a great deal of uncertainty. The ultimate implications of AI for both the macroeconomy and financial stability may take a long time to crystallize. Technology, the financial system, and the broader economy are always evolving. The potential transition to our new world could be bumpy, and it is too early to tell what trajectory will ultimately play out. Our research is continually enriched by the insights provided by market participants in regular outreach, keeping us abreast of the latest developments in AI and their economic implications, and by an ever-expanding analytical toolkit, including AI. Ensuring that the AI revolution unfolds within the context of a stable financial system is not just desirable\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is also imperative for achieving our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\nThank you.\n1.

Barr\nAt the 2025 National College Fed Challenge Finals, Federal Reserve Board, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nThank you, Robin, and to the students, advisers, and others who are our guests today, welcome to the Federal Reserve.\nI'm glad I could be here this morning for these finals of the College Fed Challenge, which the Federal Reserve Board is hosting for the 22nd\u00a0year. The challenge for students on the six teams competing today is to prepare and present a monetary policy recommendation that will best promote the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.\nLet me begin by congratulating the students and advisers of the teams who will face each other today, representing the University of Chicago, Davidson College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Pace University, and the University of California at Los Angeles. They advanced to the finals by winning preliminary rounds of the competition earlier this year. A record 139 schools competed in 2025, from 36 states, a geographical reach that I am pleased to say has steadily grown in recent years. I am also happy that, for the first time since the pandemic moved this competition online, these finals are back to being held in person, in the very room where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets.\nAs a former university leader and a citizen who thinks about the future of our country, I think it is wonderful to see this Board room filled with bright young minds motivated to learn about how a vital function of the Federal Reserve promotes a healthy economy that works for everyone. Only one team will be judged the winner of today's competition, but you are all to be commended for the hard work and skill that brought you here. I feel honored to share this moment with you and to think about what each of you will do over the course of your lives to advance the public interest.\nIn just a couple of weeks, my colleagues on the FOMC and I will meet in this room and sit around this table. The FOMC will be facing very much the same questions you take up today. Like you, we will be carefully examining the latest available data on economic and financial conditions, a task made more challenging by data delays caused by the government shutdown. We will apply our understanding of how monetary policy influences the economy to render our best judgment of the policy stance that will most effectively further the Federal Reserve's dual mandate, as set out by Congress, to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Often the answer to the policy questions in front of us at this table is not clear. We listen to each other's views as each of us does our best to assess appropriate policy and weigh the risks that economic and financial conditions may evolve in unexpected ways. Arriving at the best decision requires that monetary policy can be conducted independently of short-term political pressures.\nCrucial to the success of monetary policymaking is clearly explaining the Committee's actions and intentions to the public, similar to the task that you will face later today when you present your recommendations to our judges. As I expect you have learned in preparing for this contest, clear communication is essential because monetary policy works to a considerable extent by helping to inform the public's view of future economic and financial conditions.\nI hope your preparations for this event have added to your understanding of the economy and the Federal Reserve's role and perhaps will even spur some of you to pursue further study of economics and finance. Among the talented individuals who are participating in today's challenge, I hope there are some who may one day contribute to our understanding of the economy and to the work of the Fed. Perhaps some of you may even choose to spend at least some of your careers in public service, one of the most satisfying parts of my life's work and a profession that needs talented and conscientious people. I hope that all of you have benefitted from this experience, by adding to your knowledge and by developing research, analytical, and communication skills that will help you in whatever careers you choose.\nI'd like to thank the judges who have given their time and brought their expertise and experience to the evaluation of each team's work. They are among the talented and valued professionals on the staff of the Federal Reserve System who are so important to the work we do. Karen Pence is deputy associate director in the Division of Research and Statistics here at the Federal Reserve Board, Francisco Vazquez-Grande is a senior adviser in the Division of Monetary Affairs, and Matthew Lueke is deputy secretary of the FOMC. Thomas Lubik is a senior adviser in the research department at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, one of a number of Reserve Bank staff who have generously given their time to serve as judges this year.\nAlso, let me thank the faculty advisers of each of the six teams for helping guide, motivate, and prepare today's finalists.\nAnd thanks also to the Federal Reserve staff who have organized the competition this year. Thanks to them and all of you, the Fed Challenge is helping to inform the public about our work and investing in your future, for the betterment of all.\nIn closing, I wish you all the best of luck in what I expect will be a spirited competition.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            November 21, 2025",

Cook\nAt Georgetown University\u00e2\u0080\u0099s McDonough School of Business Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Reena. It is an honor to be back at Georgetown and at the Psaros Center.\n1\nI have spent a significant amount of time on and around this campus, including when I served as a congressional intern early in my career. Perhaps in fate's way of foreshadowing, one of the topics I researched that summer was the Glass-Steagall Act. Turns out that it was handy to learn about at a young age.\nFinancial stability is a focal point of my attention at the Board of Governors, since I serve as chair of the Board's Committee on Financial Stability. Allow me to start by saying that the financial system remains resilient, supported by strong balance sheets among households and businesses and high capital levels across the banking system. Earlier this month, the Fed issued the most recent version of our semiannual Financial Stability Report. That report affirmed the system is resilient, while also noting some of the same risks and vulnerabilities we have seen in recent reports.\nMy remarks will center on three areas of vulnerabilities: asset valuations; the structural shift in lending to private companies, away from traditional bank loans and toward private credit arrangements; and the growing role of hedge funds as investors in the U.S. Treasury market. Finally, I will turn to a longer-term issue\u00e2\u0080\u0094the potential for the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in financial market trading that could both increase and decrease financial stability.\nLet's begin by putting financial-system vulnerabilities into context. The Federal Reserve promotes financial stability in order to support the achievement of its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability. That is, achieving maximum employment and price stability depends on a stable financial system. We know from history, whether from the distant past\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Great Depression\u00e2\u0080\u0094or from the recent past\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Great Financial Crisis or the Great Recession\u00e2\u0080\u0094that financial crises typically lead to large job losses and high unemployment.\n2\nHowever, given the complexity of the financial system, it is sometimes hard to see the connection between the system and everyday life.\nLiving and teaching in Michigan during the Great Recession, I saw firsthand how the financial system's fragility contributed directly to job losses. One example is how the default of Lehman Brothers contributed, via a chain of events, to declines in employment in Michigan. Lehman's failure in September 2008 led a money market fund to \"break the buck\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094the fall in the value of its assets meant it could no longer redeem shares for the $1 that investors expected to receive\u00e2\u0080\u0094prompting a run on the funds. In turn, the funds pulled back from riskier assets, including asset-backed commercial paper. But the major auto finance companies depended on that commercial paper to finance loans to consumers; hence, they came under stress.\n3\nWith less credit available, auto sales plummeted, and Michigan was hit very hard. Many people\u00e2\u0080\u0094including some of my family members, my students' and colleagues' family members, friends, and neighbors\u00e2\u0080\u0094lost their jobs and experienced significant hardship. The Michigan unemployment rate exceeded 14 percent in 2009, while the national unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent in 2009. Correspondingly, foreclosures more than tripled in Michigan between 2006 and 2010, and home values in Michigan sank 33 percent over the same period.\nI tell this story, not because I fear we are on the brink of a financial crisis, but because I think it is worth emphasizing why resilience of the financial system matters for the real economy\u00e2\u0080\u0094a point I have made since writing my dissertation\u00e2\u0080\u0094and for everyday Americans' lives. A stable and resilient financial system supports employment and stable prices and ensures families and businesses can function effectively in the economy. That is why policymakers work diligently to understand the functioning of the financial system and is one reason we publish a financial stability report twice a year. And, of course, the story emphasizes the need to maintain resilience in the financial system.\nAsset Valuations\nWith that background, allow me to turn to the financial system vulnerabilities I consider to be most salient currently, beginning with asset valuations. When we evaluate asset valuations, we do not look at the actual levels of asset prices. Rather, we look at their levels relative to fundamentals and whether their levels relative to fundamentals are high by historical standards.\n4\nAs noted in the Financial Stability Report, our assessment of asset valuations is that they are, on the whole, elevated relative to historical benchmarks in a number of markets, including equity markets, corporate bond markets, leveraged loan markets, and housing markets.\nTo be sure, this is not investment advice. Indeed, it is neither my role nor my desire to offer any comment on the merits of different asset valuations. Our role at the Fed is to simply observe that expected compensation for risk is low relative to history\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that might revert, stay low, or even go lower. And situations of elevated valuations are quite common. Asset valuations have been stretched many times since the 2009 trough.\nI consider any potential financial system vulnerability through the lens of how it might constrain the Federal Reserve's ability to attain its dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. Currently, my impression is that there is an increased likelihood of outsized asset price declines. However, given the system's overall resilience, I do not see the kinds of weaknesses that played out so painfully in the Great Recession, and, thus, I do not see potential asset price declines as posing risks to the financial system.\nPrivate Credit\nAnother potential vulnerability worth watching is the growth of private credit. Fed staff estimate that, over the past five years, private credit has roughly doubled. Whenever we observe such rapid growth in credit over such a short period of time, it draws our attention. I use the term private credit to describe loans to\nprivately held\nbusinesses that originate from\nnonbank entities\n. Privately held businesses are companies without publicly traded stock that generally lack access to public capital markets for debt or equity finance. The growth in nonbank lending to privately held businesses has increased credit access. As a result, private businesses that have difficulty securing a loan from a bank can continue to grow their businesses with loans from private credit providers.\nIn one of its simplest forms, private credit involves a straightforward intermediation chain. Investors with very long investment horizons and no particular need for liquidity invest in a private credit vehicle, such as a private credit fund or business development company (BDC), which then extends loans to private businesses. Such investments are usually locked up or ineligible for redemption for five to seven years, or even longer. At its best, private credit vehicles conduct due diligence and monitor the loans on behalf of the investors. Private credit vehicles tend to have a strong incentive to monitor these loans and can flexibly respond to emerging distress. This careful monitoring is important, because private businesses are not subject to the same public scrutiny\u00e2\u0080\u0094auditing and disclosure standards\u00e2\u0080\u0094as their public counterparts. This model has the potential to enhance financial stability and expand economic growth, since it matches longer-maturity loans with longer-term funding and allows firms to get the financing they need on favorable terms. Default rates have also been low and returns high.\nNonetheless, we should expand the lens and inspect this funding vehicle more closely. We have also seen more complex intermediation chains involving more leveraged players, such as banks and insurance companies, emerge in recent years.\n5\nSome private firms may also have multiple sources of funding.\nThe increased complexity and the interconnections with leveraged financial entities create more channels through which unexpected losses in private credit could spread to the broader financial system. What do recent trends in the sector suggest about the potential for such losses and financial stability risks? I do not currently see the potential for private credit to contribute to an unexpected credit crunch in the same way that the asset-backed commercial paper market did in 2008.\nHowever, it is well worth keeping a close eye on developments here. Default rates remain low, but they are a backward-looking measure and could also reflect increased usage of payment-in-kind arrangements, or PIKs; loan amendments; and distressed exchanges. Recent private business bankruptcies in the auto sector also revealed unexpected losses and exposure across a broad range of financial entities, including banks, hedge funds, and specialty finance companies.\nShould we expect to see more? There are some reasons to interpret the recent failures as outliers. I do not assess the current risks from private credit to be a threat to financial stability. The businesses that failed recently may have been more exposed to changes in trade and immigration policy, made more use of off-balance sheet financing, or been of poorer credit quality than other private businesses. Therefore, it is difficult to infer general lessons from these specific cases.\nYet, history teaches us a lesson here. The likelihood of observing additional cases like those recently in the news increases when size of exposure and level of complexity in these arrangements are not transparent, when a sector experiences periods of rapid growth, and when these arrangements have not been through a full credit cycle (boom and bust). Accordingly, I will continue to focus on ensuring that we understand developments in this sector and how these lending arrangements are evolving over time.\nHedge Fund Footprint in Treasury Markets\nAnother vulnerability I am following carefully is the footprint of hedge funds in the U.S. Treasury market. This footprint has grown substantially over the past few years and recently just exceeded its previous, pre-pandemic peak. My focus relates to the potential for transmitting stress to the U.S. Treasury market, which is critical to the functioning of our financial system. The U.S. Treasury market is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world. Treasury securities, by serving as a source of safe and liquid assets, enable the efficient and stable flow of capital across the global financial system. The Treasury market averages around $900 billion in transactions per day, with transactions on high-volume days around $1.5 trillion per day in recent years.\n6\nThe smooth operation of U.S. Treasury markets is also critical for the transmission and implementation of monetary policy.\nHedge funds' holdings of Treasury cash securities\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, Treasury bills, notes, and bonds\u00e2\u0080\u0094have increased from representing about 4.6 percent of total Treasury securities outstanding in the first quarter of 2021 to representing 10.3 percent in the first quarter of this year, just above its pre-pandemic peak of 9.4 percent.\n7\nThis represents significant growth in the scale of liquidations that could result, if hedge funds were to sharply reduce their Treasury positions because of changing market conditions. We witnessed such an episode at the start of the pandemic during the \"dash for cash\" when sales of Treasuries by a broad range of market participants increased dramatically and all at once.\n8\nThe sensitivity of hedge fund Treasury positions to shifting market conditions depends on the Treasury trading strategies that hedge funds are pursuing. Staff analysis suggests that the vast majority of hedge fund Treasury positions involve relative value trading strategies, of which there are many types. These trades exploit relative price differences between related securities\u00e2\u0080\u0094pairs or combinations of Treasury cash securities, Treasury derivatives, or interest rate derivatives. To be sure, outside of episodes of stress, relative value trades substantially improve the efficiency and liquidity of Treasury securities and related markets. Yet, during episodes of stress, the unwinding of crowded positions in such trades could magnify instability in these markets.\nRelative value trading strategies typically share key features that create potential Treasury market vulnerabilities.\n9\nFor example, relative value trades are highly leveraged to amplify returns from small price differentials, with these trades generally funded with repo that is shorter term than the maturity of the trade, resulting in maturity mismatch. As a result, these strategies are exposed to significant funding risks that could arise from instability in repo markets. Relative value trades that involve derivative contracts\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as the cash-futures basis trade and the swap-spread trade\u00e2\u0080\u0094are further exposed to margin calls when additional liquidity is required to satisfy increased minimum margin requirements. Such adverse funding shocks can result from episodes of market volatility or from moves in relative prices that are disadvantageous to the trade. Sudden funding shocks can then prompt an unwinding of hedge fund positions, resulting in significant Treasury security sales and the potential for market liquidity strains. Increased volatility and losses due to changes in relative prices can also lead hedge funds to choose to exit trades for risk-management reasons, also resulting in large Treasury security sales.\n10\nAll of these features of relative value strategies can make Treasury market liquidity conditions\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, in the extreme, market functioning\u00e2\u0080\u0094more vulnerable to stress.\nNote that it is not inevitable that episodes of market volatility will induce an unwinding of relative value trades and, indeed, instances of one of these trades unwinding are rare. As you know, the swap-spread trade\u00e2\u0080\u0094a relative value trade between Treasury securities and interest rate swaps\u00e2\u0080\u0094experienced an unwinding during April's heightened market volatility, because the relative prices of securities at the core of the trade moved in ways that became unfavorable to the trade. Nonetheless, other relative value trades remained fully intact. This was especially notable for the cash-futures basis trade, reflecting the fact that conditions in repo markets remained orderly throughout the episode.\n11\nNotwithstanding, the paucity of sizable relative value trade unwindings remains a potential impetus for market liqu",

Miran\nAt the Bank Policy Institute and Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nThe Federal Reserve is actively revising its banking regulations, a project that I strongly support. For many years, financial regulation mostly moved in one direction, increasingly restricting the banking sector. Because the interactions of regulation with financial markets, the economy, and monetary policy implementation are too often unappreciated, this led to adverse consequences and lots of head scratching as to their causes. In some respects, regulations enacted to shore up financial stability have constrained the Fed's control over some elements of monetary policy transmission and the size of the balance sheet. Regulatory dominance of the balance sheet must be considered and accounted for to ensure the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), through its statutory mandate, has autonomy over conducting monetary policy.\nMy goal in today's remarks is to share the core principles that will help guide my decision making in this area, including how regulation affects the Fed's balance sheet as well as current efforts to reform bank leverage requirements. While discussions about bank reserve balances and interest paid on reserves, the composition of the balance sheet, and Treasury market intermediation are flourishing, I believe that many of these conversations are downstream of the bank regulatory framework. Once we properly tailor the regulatory environment, we can then address questions that are more pertinent to monetary policy implementation.\nBefore delving into specifics, let me describe five guiding principles. First, I believe that policymakers should always consider the potential costs and benefits of any regulation that crosses their desks. Far too often, adverse spillovers are recognized only after the fact, and the answer to a poorly functioning regulation is the Band-Aid approach of layering on another regulation. Banking regulation typically involves tradeoffs between ensuring smooth market functioning and credit availability during typical conditions and limiting the frequency or magnitude of stressful episodes.\nMapping how second-order impacts are expected to flow through the financial system and economy can help shape regulatory frameworks that are sensible and durable. For instance, the costs and benefits of a regulation on a community bank are rarely comparable to those of the same regulation on a systemically important bank, but heavily impact the credit available to Main Street businesses where local knowledge is critical. Our regulatory framework should take that into account and allow community banks to remain the engines of their local economies, and I would support proposals to grant additional relief aimed at community banks.\nA second principle is that policymakers should resist the urge to overreact in the wake of crisis. Broadly speaking, I believe regulators went too far after the 2008 financial crisis, creating many rules that raised the cost of credit and limited its availability without reducing risk in a compensatory fashion. The signs of this overreach are clear: Many traditional banking activities have migrated away from the regulated banking sector partly because burdensome rules have made provision of these services too costly or otherwise difficult for banks to provide. While I have no bias against nonbank financial companies, credit allocation should be driven by market forces, not regulatory arbitrage.\nThird, the Federal Reserve should aim for the smallest footprint it can manage. This means limiting distortions to the provision of credit in the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0094for instance, through large-scale asset purchases. It also means sticking to our clear statutory mandate and not coloring outside the lines, and we have recently taken steps in these directions. For example, the FOMC recently announced that maturing agency mortgage-backed securities will be replaced with Treasury bills in the Fed's portfolio, and the Board voted to rescind the Fed's climate guidance. Maintaining a focus on our congressional mandates is essential to ensuring the Fed remains a credible independent organization. There is more work to be done in reorienting the Fed's activities to properly heed our narrow statutory mandate.\nFourth, transparency has many benefits. Banks are one of the most heavily regulated sectors in the economy, and regulators owe the public an accounting for our actions. Transparency is also pragmatic, because it means that banks will understand what we expect of them. Without transparency, effective congressional oversight is impossible. For this reason, I was pleased to vote in favor of the Board's recent issuance of its stress testing framework for public comment.\nLast is a principle that I try to consider in most of my work, which is to keep an open mind. Good new ideas can come from any direction; the regulatory process guarantees that the public can provide input, but regulators listen to different degrees. I will be listening.\nConnecting these principles to the work I am doing as a Governor: After two and a half years of shrinking our balance sheet, the FOMC has decided to end those reductions beginning December 1, as the Committee gauged reserve balances to be somewhat around or above ample.\nBut what determines whether reserves are ample or not? Before the Global Financial Crisis, reserve levels were much lower, or scarce. Even some months ago, reserves were higher, or abundant. Empirically, we can use movements in money markets to assess when conditions are shifting from one regime to another; but, to me, this ignores first principles. Liquidity requirements force banks to hold high-quality liquid assets, including reserves. Meanwhile, capital requirements, such as the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR) and global systemically important bank surcharge, impose costs to hold those assets. When these banks, many of which are primary dealers of U.S. Treasury securities, attempt to get that new government debt from auctions to investors, they navigate a regulatory patchwork of contradictory incentives.\nSupervisory policy can also boost demand for reserves. In a 2022 podcast, former Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randy Quarles describes how supervisory preferences for reserves over other types of liquid assets, as well as fear of heightened scrutiny or supervisory action, can raise demand for bank reserves above and beyond what's required.\n2\nFor all the talk about fiscal dominance of monetary policy, the reality is that the size of the balance sheet is a result of regulatory dominance. Regulations boost demand for reserves, which in turn requires us to end runoff or purchase securities for reserve management purposes. These actions may affect financial conditions and create cross currents with monetary policy goals. The Fed no longer targets monetary aggregates like reserve levels, but that doesn't mean we should not think about them.\nA consequence of the Fed's large balance sheet is significant payments of interest to the banking sector. Now, this is little different for banks' income than if they held Treasurys directly, as would occur in a scarce-reserves regime. In fact, an upward-sloping yield curve would suggest banks would earn more from holding Treasurys rather than reserves.\nRegardless, the optics differ. Large interest on reserve balances (IORB) outlays may appear like the Fed is unfairly subsidizing the banking system with billions of dollars, even if that's not the case. These perceptions can affect the Fed's credibility and thus its effectiveness. Several times now, the Senate has debated whether the Fed ought to be stripped of its statutory authority to pay IORB despite its necessity as a tool for managing the federal funds rate.\nIt has become apparent to me that trying to settle the ongoing debates on how monetary policy is best implemented before settling the regulatory framework is putting the cart before the horse. Due to regulatory dominance, regulations will determine the right size of the balance sheet and the role for IORB.\nAs I noted, I remain open to new ideas, including on the Fed's balance sheet. For example, the Fed pays interest to banks, but not on the Treasury General Account (TGA). Should the Fed also pay interest, or similar compensation, to Treasury?\n3\nIn one sense, it's a wash on the consolidated government balance sheet; reducing the Fed's net profits also reduces remittances to Treasury. But with a deferred asset position that occasionally reflects losses on the SOMA portfolio, paying interest on TGA could smooth remittances over time, reducing the volatility of fiscal borrowing.\nAdditionally, rather than keep our liabilities to Treasury as zero-yielding deposits directly, would it make more sense for the Fed to hold short-term assets such as Treasury bills or repos against the TGA? Currently, days when new Treasury securities settle often result in sharp and temporary declines in reserve supply. But the Fed could sterilize these settlements by flexibly adjusting its balance sheet through open market operations. Versions of this idea have been proposed by Bill Nelson and Annette Vissing-Jorgensen.\n4\nI think we should consider all avenues for improving market functioning, particularly when volatility arises from regular and foreseeable government debt settlement dates.\nMoving to leverage ratios, I see the benefit of the proposal the Board issued before I arrived because the leverage ratio should not be the binding constraint on banks in the ordinary course of managing their balance sheets, incentivizing higher-risk behavior for no good reason. However, I also believe that penalizing holdings of Treasurys and reserves through leverage ratios is at odds with requiring banks to hold those instruments as high-quality liquid assets to cover potential outflows.\nIn addition, dealer intermediation of the Treasury market can suffer if banks are forced to hold substantial capital just to support their Treasury and repo trading books, which often are low-return, low-risk, high-volume activities. This otherwise esoteric issue can have meaningful consequences for Treasury market functioning and monetary policy implementation.\nRemoving these securities from the leverage ratio, as was suggested as an alternative in the proposed rule, would help insulate the Treasury market from stressful episodes when liquidity is in short supply. Due to heightened uncertainty accompanying extreme volatility, policymakers tend to \"overdo it\" when overreacting to dysfunction. Instead of being forced to react to Treasury market dysfunction after it has occurred, I think excluding those assets now is a small price to pay to deter that potential dysfunction.\nPreventing Treasury market dysfunction in the first place may be the best way to limit the Fed's footprint. Moreover, providing this relief ex post instead of ex ante may lead to the unfortunate perception that the Federal Reserve is bailing out specific entities for poor investment decisions.\nWhile I have noted my openness to new ideas, this one is not novel. The banking regulators excluded Treasurys and reserves from the leverage ratio denominator in response to the increase in bank deposits during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The only observable downside from that intervention came from the transition back to including them in the denominator. Banks then shunned deposits to avoid pushing against their leverage ratios, helping lead to a flood of cash into money market funds and the exorbitant rise in usage of the overnight reverse repo facility, in turn limiting the extent to which quantitative tightening drained reserves for several years. Bank and depositor behavior were unnecessarily distorted: As interest rates rose in 2022 and 2023, some banks had to reverse course and compete for deposits, whipsawing banking behavior that should otherwise be relatively stable. There are already certain instruments that are excluded from some leverage ratio denominators, like custody bank reserves supporting operational deposits, and there is no evidence this is disruptive.\nIn any case, this is an exciting time to be a bank regulator, which is not something I imagined to be possible before arriving here. And we are still very much in the early innings of change. As I said before, the right level of bank reserves in the system is ultimately a function of that regulatory environment. As we right-size the regulations, my hope is that it will allow us to further reduce the size of the balance sheet, relaxing the grip of regulatory dominance. Given emergent funding market signals, I supported ending the runoff of the Fed's balance sheet immediately at the FOMC's October meeting rather than waiting until December 1, though the difference between October 29 and December 1 is not enormous.\nIndeed, as we make more progress peeling back regulations, I expect the optimal level of reserves may drop below where it is now, at least relative to GDP or the size of the banking system. It is possible that in the future, it will be appropriate to resume shrinking the balance sheet; stopping runoff today does not necessarily mean stopping it forever. That would also enable us to reduce our interest payments on reserves. If we go far enough with removing regulations, we may be able to limit perceptions that the Fed is picking winners and losers through regulations, asset purchases, and credit allocation decisions. But before further reductions in the balance sheet, we first have to get the regulations right and ensure that bank balance sheets are flexible enough for an environment with a smaller Federal Reserve footprint.\nThank you.\n1.

Barr\nAt the Alan Meltzer Speaker Series, Kogod School of Business, American University, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nI am pleased to be here today to discuss a core part of the Federal Reserve's mission: banking supervision.\n1\nMuch of what the Fed does to conduct monetary policy, promote a stable financial system, provide a safe and efficient payments system, and support consumers and community development depends on a healthy banking system. Lending fuels entrepreneurship, helps families buy homes, and enables communities to thrive\u00e2\u0080\u0094all critical aspects of a healthy economy. Ensuring banks operate in a safe and sound manner is essential because the banking system sits at the center of the economy. That is why banks' risk-taking must always be guided by clear guardrails, underpinned by effective banking supervision.\nWe need these guardrails because experience shows that market discipline alone does not prevent excessive risk-taking by banks.\n2\nAs I've noted before, time and again, periods of relative financial calm have led to efforts to weaken regulation and supervision.\n3\nThis has often had dire consequences, as we saw prominently during the Global Financial Crisis.\nIn the midst of that crisis, I saw first-hand in my own community in Michigan what weak regulation and supervision could mean: foreclosed homes, shuttered businesses, and lost jobs. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Michigan's unemployment rate was 14.9 percent in 2009, meaning one in seven workers were out of jobs.\n4\nNationwide, the consequences were immense: nearly 9 million jobs lost, 8 million homes foreclosed upon, and a $17 trillion loss in household wealth.\n5\nWe are now, I believe, at a moment of inflection in the regulatory and supervisory approaches that help keep banks healthy. There are growing pressures to weaken supervision\u00e2\u0080\u0094to scale back examiner coverage, to dilute ratings systems, and to redefine \"unsafe and unsound\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094in ways that will make it harder for examiners to act before it is too late to prevent a build-up of excessive risk. These pressures present real dangers to the American people.\nThe Mission of Banking Supervision\nLet me begin with the mission of bank supervision, which is to promote a safe, sound, and efficient banking system that supports a strong economy.\n6\nOur banking system relies on trust. That trust is earned when banks behave responsibly and when supervisors effectively perform their statutory duties. These duties include verifying that banks are operating soundly and identifying and addressing weaknesses before they threaten the solvency of particular banks and possibly spread through the financial system. Supervision also ensures compliance with laws and regulations that safeguard the integrity of the banking system. This reduces the risk of misconduct or malfeasance, including real-world consequences of fraud, consumer abuse, cyberattacks, money laundering, and terrorist financing. Trust in the banking system relies on strong supervision.\nBenefits of Supervision\nSupervision delivers clear benefits not only for individual banks but also for the stability of the financial system as a whole. Enforcement actions are associated with lower systemic risk, and research shows that banks subject to more oversight are safer and just as profitable as their peers.\n7\nWhile supervision does impose costs, it is most effective when calibrated to the risks each institution poses. More closely supervised banks tend to experience steadier income and fewer loan losses, making them more resilient during times of stress, when contagion risks are greatest.\n8\nSupervision is critical to the Federal Reserve's mission to promote the stability of the financial system and contain systemic risk. A macroprudential perspective\u00e2\u0080\u0094where we look across the entire banking system for correlated risks\u00e2\u0080\u0094complements traditional microprudential oversight where we examine individual banks. This is done by focusing on risks that threaten financial stability and the banking system's core functions: credit, payments, and intermediation. Our economy depends on a strong and stable financial system, which makes banking supervision essential for every household and business.\nThe Foundations of Effective Supervision\nEffective supervision begins with appropriate regulation as a foundation. Regulation provides the rules of the road that establish minimum capital levels, liquidity requirements, and define permissible activities. But regulation alone is not enough. Supervision is necessary to ensure banks stay on the road and comply with the rules, especially as conditions shift and new risks emerge.\nEffective supervision depends on its human capital. The knowledge necessary to be an effective examiner comes from both formal training and through an accumulation of on-the-ground practical exposure. Supervisory staff carry responsibility for risk identification and analysis and execution of examinations to assess whether a firm truly understands its risks, whether its governance and controls are effective, and whether its capital and liquidity are sufficient for its business model. Institutional knowledge and experience-based judgment are critical for supervisors' ability to manage these responsibilities. They take time to develop and cannot be easily replicated.\nEffective supervision also requires moving with speed, force, and agility appropriate to the risks posed. This requires institutional commitment to act swiftly as risks emerge, using supervisory tools decisively, and adapting to shifts in markets or the economy.\n9\nEffective Supervision Under Pressure\nBeyond these foundations, effective supervision is based on numerous other factors. Today I will outline key components of strong, effective supervision that are at risk of being seriously weakened in the current environment.\nA credible ratings framework.\nFirst, effective supervision requires a credible rating system.\n10\nA credible rating system incentivizes firms to promptly remediate weaknesses by translating supervisory assessments into objective outcomes that matter for management and boards of directors. It ensures consistency across institutions, supports transparency in how risks are evaluated, and anchors supervisory discipline.\nCrucially, a credible rating system looks beyond immediate financial metrics to the quality of a firm's governance, internal controls, and risk management practices.\n11\nWeak management rarely shows up first as a capital or liquidity problem. Rather, it becomes evident through inconsistent processes, inadequate escalation of supervisory concerns, unclear lines of accountability, and organizational blind spots that, over time, allow risks to accumulate. These weaknesses can prevent management from seeing and effectively acting on emerging risks. A ratings system that captures only past actions that have resulted in observable financial harm is inherently backward-looking. It will miss the risks of what may come.\nUnfortunately, the framework for supervisory ratings is currently being modified in ways that diminish its strength and credibility. For example, earlier this month, the Federal Reserve Board issued its final rule making changes to the Large Financial Institution (LFI) rating system.\n12\nPoor performance is being deemphasized, which is tantamount to grade inflation, a problem this academic audience understands. As I noted in my dissent, I believe these changes reduce incentives for large banks to fix serious management problems.\n13\nThey will also allow firms with significant governance weaknesses to expand or acquire other enterprises, raising the chance and cost of future failure. Changes to the LFI rating system also reduce supervisory attention on compliance matters for the largest banks. As such, bank holding companies could have, for example, seriously deficient consumer compliance programs but still be considered well managed. Further, the revisions remove the presumption that large firms with significant deficiencies must face an enforcement action\u00e2\u0080\u0094a move that could significantly weaken accountability for poor practices. And in taking this action, the Board ignored a more moderate reform option that would have established a composite rating for large bank holding companies.\nIn addition, I understand that efforts are currently underway to modify the CAMELS rating system, the interagency framework used by supervisors to assess banks' overall condition.\n14\nSome have proposed changes that would effectively diminish the weight assigned to the management component. I believe that such a move would be misguided and shortsighted. The \"Management\" rating is not simply one item among six; it is the element that ties the others together. It measures the quality of governance, risk identification, internal controls, and the institution's ability to respond to emerging threats.\n15\nStrong management can compensate for unexpected stress, whereas weak management can magnify even modest vulnerabilities. Deemphasizing the rating system's focus on management could lead to significant increases in risk, even in institutions that look good on paper.\nFurthermore, in October, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) proposed a rule that would limit the issuance of enforcement actions for \"unsafe or unsound practices.\"\n16\nThis would have the effect of making it harder for supervisors to issue an enforcement action and compel a bank to fix its flaws. This effectively ties examiners hands. The proposed rule would also limit the issuance of matters requiring attention, or MRAs, which are supervisory findings used to prompt a bank to act quickly to fix problems before they become enforcement actions. The new standards for issuing enforcement actions and MRAs would center on a narrow definition of\n\"\nmaterial financial risk\" and exclude material nonfinancial risks except in limited circumstances, such as violations of law.\nTo put this into context, under the standard established by this proposed rule, a bank with woefully deficient controls to prevent money laundering or discrimination would not necessarily receive an MRA requiring the bank to correct the situation unless the bank had actually violated the law or supervisors were able to identify a material financial harm that had already occurred due to the lapse in controls or that could be shown to likely cause such harm. Waiting to act until the bank, its customers, or potentially the financial system have been harmed is not a responsible approach to risk management or supervision. Bottom line\u00e2\u0080\u0094under this proposal, examiners will issue fewer MRAs, even where financial and operational risks have been identified. This will also lead the agencies to issue fewer enforcement actions. I fear that the Fed may head down a similar, or even worse, path, further tying supervisors' hands.\nFurthermore, I am concerned about an initiative that will allow the banks themselves to decide whether a supervisory finding or requirement imposed by an enforcement action should be lifted. Under this approach, if a bank had a satisfactorily-rated internal audit function, that internal audit function would have the ability to decide if the bank had appropriately remediated a deficiency identified in the supervisory finding or enforcement action. A bank's internal audit function would essentially displace validation by Federal Reserve examiners. Examiners would not independently determine whether the terms of the supervisory findings or enforcement action provisions had been met, or whether the bank's changes were sustainable. A parallel approach was tried at the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), where the internal audit function of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was permitted to \"validate\" remediation of MRAs, and FHFA's supervisory division sometimes accepted that validation in closure determinations without independent validation. In 2018, the FHFA's inspector general found this problematic, and warned that allowing such discretion \"without a predicate supervisory conclusion \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 creates the risk that \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 assessments \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 will be impaired.\"\n17\nThis is a bad idea for bank prudential supervision, and to be clear, will not be implemented in the consumer compliance function.\nForward-looking supervision.\nA second component of effective supervision is that it must be forward-looking.\n18\nThe purpose of supervision is to prevent risks from becoming problems that harm banks and the public. By anticipating vulnerabilities and prompting early action, supervisors use tools such as stress testing and scenario analysis to prevent problems from escalating. In contrast, backward-looking supervision often detects weaknesses only after they become serious problems. Forward-looking approaches, grounded in judgment and horizontal comparisons, are more effective in promoting the safety and soundness of individual banks and safeguarding financial stability. In short, supervision needs to see and point out how weak risk management can lead a bank to be vulnerable to unanticipated shocks.\nStress tests illustrate this principle clearly: they are supposed to provide a rigorous way to assess resilience under severe but plausible conditions that may occur in the future. Supervisory stress tests are structured exercises conducted by supervisors to evaluate how a bank's capital and earnings would perform under adverse macroeconomic scenarios\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as a sharp rise in unemployment, a collapse in asset prices, or a severe market disruption. They are designed to test the soundness of a bank's balance sheet and to ensure that it could continue to operate and support the economy even in times of stress. These tests help to uncover vulnerabilities at individual banks and across the financial system.\nIn October, the Federal Reserve proposed several changes to our heretofore-successful stress testing program.\n19\nI noted then that the proposed changes risk turning the stress test into a rigid exercise that offers false confidence by producing overly optimistic results driven by less conservative modeling and opportunities for banks to game the process.\n20\nThe proposed changes would weaken capital requirements and erode incentives for strong independent risk management. Weaker stress tests mean worse supervision.\nAnother valuable forward-looking tool that has been criticized lately is the use of horizontal reviews, supervisory examinations focused on a specific topic across multiple banks simultaneously. This technique allows supervisors to spot emerging risks, helping supervisory frameworks remain proactive rather than reactive. Because financial risks develop and change ",

Waller\nAt the Society of Professional Economists Annual Dinner, London, United Kingdom\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you to the Society for the honor of addressing your annual meeting.\n1\nIn doing a little research on the SPE's history, I noted that one goal cited by the business economists who founded this group was creating a forum to discuss the divergence between real-world challenges and economic theory. That task is pressing when business profits, losses, and the jobs of employees are on the line, and the stakes are also high for economic policymakers, who face those very challenges today.\nEconomies are confoundingly difficult to understand because, in a sense, they are the largest and most complex things ever created by humans. Economists try to make sense of this complicated world and explain in logical and clear terms how to understand it. We develop rigorous theories that yield testable hypotheses, and we test those hypotheses to see if they are supported or rejected by the data. Being both an economist and economic policymaker, my objective today is to follow in that tradition and use economic theory and various types of data to describe my outlook for the U.S. economy and my views on the appropriate course of monetary policy. It may seem odd to come all the way to London to speak about the U.S. economy, but I hope it will be of interest\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I did warn the organizers about what I would talk about. Monetary policymakers like to use forward guidance to avoid surprises.\nFormulating my outlook has been complicated recently by the 43-day government shutdown, including the agencies that produce key economic data. As I will argue, I believe the challenge presented by this missing data has been overstated in many quarters. Policymakers and forecasters are not \"flying blind\" or \"in a fog.\" While it is always nice to have more data, as economists, we are skilled at using whatever available data there is to formulate forecasts. Despite the government shutdown, we have a wealth of private and some public-sector data that provide an imperfect but perfectly actionable picture of the U.S. economy.\nSo, what is that data telling us? First, that the labor market is still weak and near stall speed. Second, that inflation through September continued to show relatively small effects from tariffs and support the hypothesis that tariffs are having a one-off effect raising price levels in the U.S. and are not a persistent source of inflation. Accounting for estimated tariff effects, underlying inflation is relatively close to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent target. Third, despite realized inflation running close to 3 percent and above target for five years, medium- and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. And, lastly, even excluding the temporary effects of the shutdown, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) has likely slowed in the second half of 2025 from its fast pace in the second quarter.\nThis reading of the data leads me, at this moment, to support a cut in the FOMC's policy rate at our next meeting on December 9 and 10 as a matter of risk management. As I will discuss in more detail, risk management, in fact, provides some practical guidance in dealing with two questions that seem to have flummoxed some people: Is the job-creation slowdown in the U.S. this year mostly supply or demand related, and how should monetary policy respond?\nBefore I delve into the outlook, I'd like to say a bit more about data availability. The official sources delayed by the U.S. government shutdown are important but by no means the only source of information for Fed policymakers about the economy. At any time, my colleagues and I rely on a range of data to form our views on economic conditions and the outlook. That can be \"hard\" data, such as official government statistics, or \"soft\" data, gleaned from surveys or conversations with a variety of people. Often, different sources of data are consistent with each other, but at critical times they can conflict. When that happens, it takes our skills as economists to reconcile this conflict.\nLet me cite two examples of my own experience to illustrate this point. First, back in 2022, the Fed was combating rampant inflation, and this required large and rapid increases in our policy rate. Standard Phillips curve models predicted that this would cause a sharp slowdown in economic growth and high unemployment. However, I had more trust in the Beveridge curve, which relates the unemployment rate to the job vacancy rate, as my guide to thinking about how the labor market would respond to these large rate hikes. I argued that we were on the steep part of the Beveridge curve, which meant that we could tighten policy and that the brunt of the effect would be borne by a decline in job vacancies, and crucially, not by the higher unemployment many predicted. A critical assumption I made was that a spike in layoffs would not occur. This assumption was controversial, since previous hard data showed that this was not the typical outcome. But all of my business contacts at that time were telling me about their struggles to find and keep workers since the COVID-19 pandemic and that they had no intention of letting workers go if aggregate demand eased. This \"soft\" data helped convince me that my view of the labor market was correct, and subsequent \"hard\" data confirmed my theoretical prediction.\nThe second example of reconciling conflicting data is from this past summer. From late spring through June, the soft data, including anecdotes from business contacts, suggested the labor market was in a \"no hire, no fire\" equilibrium. Firms repeatedly said they were holding off on hiring for a variety of reasons. Yet the hard data at that time indicated a robust job market, with job creation rising from a monthly average of 110,000 in the first quarter to 150,000 in the second quarter. It was clear to me that, once again, something wasn't quite right with the labor market despite the official data. After the June FOMC meeting, I said that the labor market was more fragile than the hard data indicated and that the Committee needed to cut the policy rate to head off substantial weakening in the labor market.\n2\nThis was clearly an out-of-consensus view that raised more than a few eyebrows. But when the July jobs report was released on August 1, the second-quarter jobs numbers were revised down dramatically\u00e2\u0080\u0094from an average of 150,000 per month to 64,000 a month, which vindicated my view. So, once again, the soft data gave a better signal of the state of the labor market than the hard data.\nNow let me turn to the outlook, and I will start with U.S. economic activity. In my last speech, I discussed an apparent conflict between some forecasts of GDP growth in the second half of 2025 and the story that the labor market is weakening.\n3\nIn the absence of more official data but with additional private-sector forecasts and surveys, it now appears to me that economic activity is not accelerating and, therefore, is tracking more closely with the weak labor market data than appeared to be the case when I spoke on October 16. For example, private-sector forecasts, as seen by the median of respondents to the Blue Chip survey, are pointing to real GDP growth for the second half of this year that will be close to the modest first-half pace and a significant slowing from the pace of last year.\nOf course, one factor lowering economic growth in the fourth quarter is the shutdown, which lasted longer than many expected. I continue to assume that any loss in real GDP growth in the fourth quarter will boost growth by roughly the same amount early next year. But besides that one-off boost from the shutdown, a possible warning about future economic activity is coming from a survey of consumer sentiment conducted by the University of Michigan. While over the decades this survey has not been closely correlated with near-term spending, large and persistent drops in consumer sentiment have occurred heading into recessions. In the United States, personal consumption expenditures are about 70 percent of GDP, so a slowdown in spending has dramatic implications for GDP growth. The Michigan survey is down significantly since July and fell unexpectedly sharply in October to near its record low reading. The dour view expressed by consumers, which may have been affected by the shutdown, lines up with what I am hearing from U.S. businesses, which report slackening demand from middle- and lower-income consumers.\nOne interesting detail from that survey is that deteriorating consumer sentiment was widespread among different demographic groups, with the exception of those who own stocks. While the booming stock market is supporting spending by a narrow band of well-off consumers, it does not reflect financial conditions for most Americans, and that is a vulnerability for the economy. The rise in the stock market is substantially driven by artificial intelligence (AI)\u00e2\u0080\u0093related businesses that only account for a small share of employment.\n4\nEven while AI's share of stock market growth and corporate profits grew significantly from 2021 through 2024, employment in AI-related firms held steady at less than 3 percent of nonfarm employment. While I believe AI will create jobs in the medium term, the AI boom on Wall Street isn't doing so yet.\nA factor that I believe will weigh on spending in the coming months is that most households are facing strains in purchasing large assets, such as housing and autos, in part because of the expense. While home price increases have slowed recently and even declined in some parts of the country, prices rose significantly in the past few years. That is especially true for lower-value homes, which is making it harder for first-time buyers.\nAlthough mortgage rates have declined a bit this year, they are still above 6 percent and much higher than the average for the decade or so before rates began rising in 2022. Housing affordability is near a record low. Since 2020, the income needed to afford a median priced home has risen by 50 percent, while median income through 2024 was up about 26 percent.\n5\nAnd while the growth of mortgage debt has slowed, that in part reflects how high mortgage rates are weighing on demand for mortgages.\nTurning to auto loan growth, it has been relatively weak this year, likely reflecting a combination of weak demand from households and pressures in car affordability. To a greater extent than housing, the cost of purchasing an auto mostly reflects the price, but interest rates play a factor in the monthly payment. Auto loan rates continue to be elevated relative to their average in the years before the pandemic. For example, in 2019, the average five-year loan carried a 5.3 percent interest rate, whereas the average is now 7.6 percent.\n6\nReflecting the combination of higher auto prices and interest rate expenses, the weeks of median income needed to purchase an average new vehicle remains elevated, rising from 32.8 weeks in November 2019 to 37.4 weeks in September this year.\n7\nTo sum up, I consider the costs of housing and autos to be an ongoing challenge for consumers, especially lower- and middle-income consumers. This is likely weighing on spending growth and would become a more acute problem if the labor market continues to weaken.\nNow let me turn to inflation, which, even with the delay in price data is the more straightforward side of the FOMC's dual mandate to discuss. Twelve-month consumer price index inflation through September was 3 percent, and estimates are that inflation based on personal consumption expenditures\u00e2\u0080\u0094the FOMC's targeted measure\u00e2\u0080\u0094was about 2.8 percent. Tariff effects have been smaller than many forecasters expected and the fraction borne by consumers will only modestly boost inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094an effect that has been quite gradual so far because of the slow drawdown of inventories that was built up in anticipation of tariffs.\nDespite inflation that has been above target for five years, inflation expectations are well anchored in the medium and longer run. To me, this shows that financial markets understand that they need to look through one-time price-level shocks and that they have confidence the FOMC will achieve its 2 percent target in the medium term. With the evidence of slower economic growth and the prospect of only modest wage increases from the weak labor market, I don't see any factors that would cause an acceleration of inflation.\nLet me now focus on the side of the FOMC's economic mandate that has more of my attention\u00e2\u0080\u0094maximum employment. In the absence of federal data on the labor market, states have continued to report on initial and continuing unemployment insurance claims and private-sector sources have continued to publish their data as well. While there are methodological differences in these private data\u00e2\u0080\u0094some of it that is less than comprehensive and some that does not meet the strictest statistical standards\u00e2\u0080\u0094the private data do contain useful information.\nAccording to the Labor Department, we know that job creation in the U.S. stalled from May through August, and with expected revisions that have been previewed and will become official next year, it is likely that employment actually fell over that period. A private-sector measure of job creation that has continued since August, produced by the payroll services firm ADP, mirrored the drop in official data from May through August, reporting a monthly average of 27,000 jobs created over that period, compared to the 143,000 a month that ADP counted for the six months up to May. While the ADP data are quite volatile and have some other shortcomings that make them less reliable than government statistics, I do think these data are telling us something. And in September and October, ADP reported that businesses created a net total of only 6,500 jobs a month. And the latest weekly data are even weaker.\nSlowing labor demand is also being echoed in surveys of employers and workers. There has been a steady decline this year in the Conference Board index of job availability reported by employers. Fewer small businesses are saying it is hard to fill jobs according to the National Federation of Independent Business. Meanwhile, job postings by Indeed continued to drift lower in October. A new survey of large employers found that these companies are predicting that 2026 will be the worst job market for new college graduates since the pandemic year of 2021, when the unemployment rate was around 6 percent at graduation time.\n8\nOne series of government labor market data that we do have, continuing state-level claims for unemployment benefits, have risen, on net, in ",

Jefferson\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri\nShare\nThank you, President Schmid, for the kind introduction and for the invitation to speak here today.\n1\nIt is an honor to be in Kansas City and in the beautiful 10th District. I welcome the opportunity to attend events like this one because I believe it is essential for Federal Reserve policymakers to share their views with the public and, just as important, to hear directly from business leaders, workers, and families about how they are experiencing the economy.\nIn many ways, the Kansas City region is a perfect place to make those connections. Sitting at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, this area has been a place where people met and shared ideas long before the United States existed. And that tradition of making connections has continued to present day. The Pony Express was founded just north of here in St. Joseph, this is the greeting card capital, and, next year, this area will bring people together from around the globe for soccer's World Cup. I am happy to have the opportunity to continue the tradition of making connections in Kansas City with all of you.\nToday I would like to share my economic outlook. I will discuss how I see recent economic activity and talk about developments pertaining to both sides of our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. I will then offer my current view of monetary policy including the Fed's balance sheet before turning to our discussion.\nEconomic Outlook\nIn shaping my economic outlook, I consider a wide variety of government, administrative, and private-sector data, including data collected by the Kansas City Fed and fellow Reserve Banks across the country. Casting a wide net for information on the economy is especially important at this moment because the recent federal government shutdown has delayed the release of key economic indicators that I typically refer to in speeches like this one, including the monthly jobs report and the personal consumption expenditures price index. While I consider federal data to be the gold standard, other sources of information are also available for policymakers to do our jobs. And part of that information comes from meetings like this one and hearing from contacts around the country. For example, ahead of our next policy meeting, I look forward to reviewing the Beige Book, a report on economic conditions in each of the twelve Reserve Bank districts, which will be released next week.\nEconomic Activity\nBefore the government shutdown, available data indicated that the U.S. economy was on a trajectory of moderate growth this year. The shutdown has likely curtailed economic activity this quarter, reflecting furloughed federal workers and the suspension of government purchases of goods and services, including payments to contractors. There may also have been spillover effects to the private sector stemming from delays in federal payments, approvals, and other government activity. I see those effects as largely temporary and likely to reverse in the coming months. Thinking more broadly, I see the balance of risks in the economy as having shifted in recent months with increased downside risks to employment compared to the upside risks to inflation, which have likely declined somewhat recently.\nLabor market\nIn the labor market, information available in recent weeks appears to be consistent with a gradual cooling in both labor demand and labor supply. For instance, unemployment insurance claims received from states have largely moved sideways in recent weeks. Anecdotal reports about the state of the labor market have been mixed, with some firms announcing a slower pace of hiring or cutbacks and others indicating they are ready to move forward with previously delayed hiring and investment.\nI expect that the unemployment rate is likely to inch up slightly by the end of the year from the relatively low 4.3 percent rate recorded in August. While still solid, I continue to view the risk to my employment forecast as skewed to the downside.\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00e2\u0080\u00af\nInflation\nThe latest available readings show that inflation is running at a rate similar to that of a year ago, a bit below 3 percent, indicating that progress toward our 2 percent target has stalled. This lack of progress appears to be due to tariff effects, with signs that inflation excluding the effects of tariffs may be continuing to make progress toward 2 percent. Some firms have indicated that they expect pass-through of pricing pressure from tariffs to pick up in the fourth quarter as the inventory of non-tariffed merchandise is depleted.\nA reasonable base case is that tariffs result in a one-time shift in the price level, not an ongoing inflation problem. That view is reinforced by inflation expectations readings. Most measures of near-term inflation expectations have retraced their spring rise, and market-based long-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. Several factors will influence the size and persistence of the rise in inflation. Those include the final tariff rates that are implemented, the extent and timing of pass-through to consumer prices, the reaction of supply chains and domestic manufacturing, and overall economic conditions. I will continue to monitor these factors closely. I remain firmly committed to returning inflation to the Fed's 2 percent target.\nMonetary Policy\nGiven that outlook, I supported last month's decision to reduce our policy rate by 1/4 percentage point. That step was appropriate because I see the balance of risks as having shifted in recent months as downside risks to employment have increased. The current policy stance is still somewhat restrictive, but we have moved it closer to its neutral level that neither restricts nor stimulates the economy. The evolving balance of risks underscores the need to proceed slowly as we approach the neutral rate.\nAt our past Federal Open Market Committee meeting, I also supported the decision to conclude the reduction of our aggregate securities holdings as of December 1. Over the course of balance sheet runoff that started in June 2022, we shrank our securities holdings by about $2.2 trillion. The Committee's long-stated plan had been to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves were somewhat above the level judged as consistent with ample reserve conditions. Signs emerged ahead of the October meeting indicating that such a standard had been reached. In money markets, repurchase agreement (repo) rates moved up persistently relative to the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate. In addition, more notable pressures on repo rates started to emerge on tax payment dates and on Treasury issuance days along with more frequent use of our standing repo facility. With repo rates trending up, the effective federal funds rate also began to move up steadily relative to the IORB rate. Those developments were what was expected to be seen as the size of the balance sheet declined and led me to support the decision to end runoff.\nStarting in December, we intend to hold the size of our balance sheet steady for a time as reserve balances continue to decline passively even as other non-reserve liabilities, such as currency, rise. We will continue to allow agency securities to run off our balance sheet and will reinvest these proceeds in Treasury bills, furthering progress toward a portfolio consisting primarily of Treasury securities. Over the coming years, this reinvestment strategy will help move the weighted average maturity of our portfolio closer to that of the outstanding stock of Treasury securities.\nI will also note that, heading into our next meeting, it remains unclear how much official data we will see before then. With respect to the path of the policy rate going forward, I will continue to determine policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. I always take a meeting-by-meeting approach. This is an especially prudent approach at this time.\nThank you again to the Kansas City Fed for hosting me today. I look forward to our discussion.\n1.

Barr\nAt the Singapore Fintech Festival, Singapore\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nIt is an honor and a pleasure to be here with you in Singapore, a crossroads for global trade and finance, to discuss the transformational nature of artificial intelligence (AI). Like other central banks around the world, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore, we at the Federal Reserve have been exploring the use of AI in our operations for quite some time as well as considering the implications of AI's adoption for the financial sector and the broader economy.\nAt the Fed, we've been interested in the effects of AI on the economy and its role in the financial system for decades. Remarkably, in 1997, Governor Susan Phillips delivered a speech noting the use of AI in consumer loan underwriting.\n2\nIn the past year, no fewer than seven speeches by Fed Governors have had \"AI\" in the title.\nToday I'll discuss the opportunities presented by AI relevant for central bankers as well as the risks it may pose that policymakers should consider. I will leave you with three main takeaways.\nThe State of AI Innovation and Deployment\nMy first main point is that while AI is a big deal that will transform economies, there are a range of outcomes for how it could do so.\nAI\u00e2\u0080\u0094algorithms that mimic human thought, communication, and choices\u00e2\u0080\u0094has been with us for decades, but AI entered a new era with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Generative AI (GenAI) captured our imagination with convincing conversations in which it is possible to go deep on a wide range of topics. Earlier forms of AI were often the bailiwick of digitally native companies, but GenAI is spreading rapidly through the economy. As of 2024, three in four large companies were using GenAI, though some report it has yet to improve their bottom line.\n3\nSmaller companies have been slower to adopt GenAI, with adoption rates reported in the high single digits, albeit with a high degree of heterogeneity among sectors. Also, one could surmise, based on other surveys of individuals, that work-related use is more widespread among employees than their CEOs realize.\n4\nA recent survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that firms plan to retrain their workforces to take advantage of AI to enhance productivity, with widespread layoffs limited.\n5\nBut survey respondents also report that AI has led firms to scale back hiring, a development that may be contributing to the recent low levels of job creation in the U.S. economy, a concern for many workers and particularly for newer entrants to the job market.\nTaking a step back, as I have noted in the past, I see two basic scenarios for how AI can transform the economy.\n6\nIn the first scenario, there is incremental adoption of GenAI that augments existing tasks and jobs. In the second scenario, a revolution occurs. GenAI transforms the nature of work and leisure, boosting the efficiency of research and development, remaking industries, and creating firms with new\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps radically new\u00e2\u0080\u0094business models.\nRight now, it is difficult to predict which scenario (or perhaps one or more intermediate scenarios) will come to pass.\nWe can already see incremental change as GenAI is increasingly integrated with standard workplace software. With its natural language interface, GenAI is inherently user friendly, so few workers need special skills or unusually onerous training to use it. At the same time, some start-ups have a more revolutionary flavor because they are centered on AI from the outset. One indicator of how the labor market is evolving toward deeper integration with AI is the skills mentioned in job postings. While overall the share of job listings that mention AI-related skills is small\u00e2\u0080\u0094about 5 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the information sector, it is about 20 percent. The financial sector, where firms are always looking for a technological edge, is not far behind, with 1 in 10 job postings mentioning AI.\n7\nSo we can see that the skills needed in some key sectors are already changing. The speed of that change is likely to increase. If the AI changes happen gradually, workers and firms will have time to adjust, but if they happen rapidly, there may be significant dislocations in the short term.\nA massive wave of data center investment has begun, pointing to signs of confidence among leading AI companies that the use of AI at scale throughout the economy is just around the corner. If they're right and AI is useful enough to keep what is currently projected to be $3 trillion of new data center capacity utilized effectively, we can expect significant changes in economies. Investment in capital generally raises labor productivity and offers the potential for higher output growth without pressure on inflation over the longer term. As I have discussed in previous remarks, if these changes are significant, they can also affect the conduct of monetary policy.\n8\nOf course, it may be the case instead that investment exceeds short-term demand, in which case there may be losses and adjustments to the AI sector.\nAI and the Financial Sector\nThe second key point I would like to make is that the financial sector is adopting AI quickly, and while there are many benefits to this adoption, the risks will need to be managed carefully.\nSo far, AI adoption in the financial sector appears to be most concentrated in areas that can enhance operational efficiency, including applications that involve text analysis, classification, and information search inside the firm, as well as customer-facing functions. These incremental improvements to common business functions are a key reason to be hopeful about AI raising labor productivity in that sector.\nAt the same time, there is significant investment in experimentation with AI for core functions for financial services. Data-driven financial-sector-specific tasks, including credit decision support, fraud detection, and trading are using AI-specific tools. Ensuring that AI is used appropriately for these functions faces appreciable challenges.\nFirst, the amount of organizational change needed by financial services firms to utilize GenAI may be substantial. History suggests progress may be slow. Adoption of machine learning, an AI technology that preceded GenAI, was concentrated in firms that were highly digitized from their founding\u00e2\u0080\u0094and even in those cases, adoption was a long process.\n9\nFintech firms organized to exploit AI from their founding can play a key role in driving efficiency forward in the sector, providing services to the incumbent firms.\n10\nBut productivity may even decrease in the short term, as heavy investments in business-process improvements take time to play out to productivity gains.\nA second challenge is the practical constraints of rushing into AI for core business activities in the financial sector, as firms need to ensure that the resulting processes and outcomes are consistent with relevant laws and appropriate risk management. Large institutions are exploring the use of GenAI, including agentic AI, in their financial models\u00e2\u0080\u0094but doing so requires care. To successfully leverage the potential of GenAI on a sustainable basis, decisions based on those models must be well controlled, numerically and legally precise, explainable, and replicable. AI developers still struggle to some extent with all of those criteria. We need to reduce the risk that AI reinforces biases in consumer lending. And we also need to guard against the risks that could result from the use of AI in financial markets. For example, profit maximization by AI-powered trading algorithms may result in tacit collusion, market manipulation, or trading strategies that result in significant market volatility or even systemic risk.\n11\nWe will need innovation that is responsive to these risks to see additional advances in the use of AI for a broad array of core financial services functions.\nAI and Central Banking\nA third and final point I would like to leave you with is that central banks, including the Fed, need to keep up with AI by increasing our speed of adoption for our own operations.\nThe nature of central banking work is inherently careful, considered, and measured when evaluating anything new. This is particularly true for any new technologies.\n12\nBut it seems clear already that the many advantages offered by AI could assist central banks in at least some of their operations, and the speed at which this technology is moving makes it appropriate to proactively engage in using AI for our own operations. That is why the Federal Reserve is using AI, where appropriate, to increase staff efficiency and effectiveness. My view is that GenAI is a transformative technology that central banks need to remain engaged with to ensure an ability to execute as technology evolves.\nAs we push ahead on efficiency gains, it is important that we leverage the right tools for the task at hand, recognizing that GenAI is not always the best choice. Some of the challenges that we face can be addressed by robotic process automation or traditional AI methods. These are the same kinds of questions that every business and organization considering AI should be weighing.\nAt the Federal Reserve, we have focused on ensuring we can leverage AI capabilities by establishing an AI program and governance framework for the use of AI technologies.\n13\nWe are taking an enterprise-wide approach of learning-by-doing and broadly adopting high-value uses of GenAI, such as writing, coding, and research activities. We have taken a \"hands on keys\" approach to having staff engage with it. We are identifying the business processes that can be improved and transformed with the technology.\nOne internal application of GenAI I am particularly excited about that helps us achieve all these goals is technology modernization. We are applying GenAI-enabled tools within clear guardrails to translate legacy code, generate unit tests, and accelerate cloud migration. So far, the result of this usage is faster delivery, improved quality, and enhanced developer experience. And it will likely mean better outcomes in support of the American people.\nGiven AI's current and prospective role in economic activity, we are devoting the necessary resources to understanding it, including by analyzing not only AI's economic and financial implications, but also exploring how AI can enhance our financial stability work, strengthen supervisory and regulatory capabilities, and ensure the smooth functioning of our payment systems.\nThese are just some of the ways that the Fed, like other organizations, is using AI to make us more productive and capable. These efforts may also help us understand the effect of AI on the economy, the banking system, and the payment system. That task will be a major job for central banks in the years ahead. AI has the potential to fundamentally change the economy and society. And as central bankers, we need to keep up.\nThank you.\n1.

Miran\nAt the BCVC Summit 2025, Harvard Club of New York City, New York, New York\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, I really appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nI am excited to be discussing stablecoins. This innovation has been unfairly treated as a pariah by some, but stablecoins are now an established and fast-growing part of the financial landscape. Putatively, stablecoins were originally intended to facilitate holding and trading cryptocurrency. But their proliferation has been aided by providing users with a stable store of value, a means of payment, and the ability to move capital quickly, irrespective of territorial borders.\nDemand for dollars continues to be strong, so it's no surprise that a more efficient means of accessing dollars has become increasingly popular. With the passage this year of the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act), there is now a clear regulatory pathway in the U.S. for stablecoin issuers to broaden their reach and solidify stablecoins as a core part of the payment system. I believe economic research has some catching up to do. Economists meticulously study demand for dollar assets and consider how monetary policy may be affected, and the rapid growth of stablecoins affects the supply of loanable funds in the U.S. economy. I am encouraged that the Federal Reserve is taking steps to recognize the importance of stablecoins for the payment system; greater transparency and rising adoption should help us consider their effect on monetary policy as well.\n2\nStablecoins and Dollars\nEssentially all stablecoins are denominated in dollars, and their success is at least partly due to the U.S. dollar's enduring status as the world's preferred currency.\n3\nStablecoins are also contributing to the dollar's dominance by allowing an ever-growing share of people around the globe to hold assets and conduct transactions in the most trusted currency.\nMy thesis is that stablecoins are already increasing demand for U.S. Treasury bills and other dollar-denominated liquid assets by purchasers outside the Unted States and that this demand will continue growing. All else equal, this new demand lowers borrowing costs for the U.S. government. However, as a central banker, my focus is on what I believe may be a substantial and long-term force putting downward pressure on a crucial guideline for monetary policymakers known as r*. The neutral rate, or r*, is the policy interest rate that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity when the economy is operating at its potential once the transitory effects of cyclical economic shocks have abated. There are several open questions with respect to the impact of stablecoins on U.S. monetary policy: How many assets will be managed by stablecoin issuers? Will the funds come from domestic or foreign sources, and where might substitution pull funds out of the banking system? What are the systemic risks related to runs on stablecoins? Since monetary policy must be forward looking, my colleagues and I would be best served exploring these topics now. In these remarks, I'll focus on the consequences for monetary policy if stablecoin growth follows industry expectations. In short, stablecoins may become a multitrillion dollar elephant in the room for central bankers.\nGENIUS Act\nWhile I tend to view new regulations skeptically, I'm greatly encouraged by the GENIUS Act. This regulatory apparatus for stablecoins establishes a level of legitimacy and accountability congruent with holding traditional dollar assets. For the purposes of monetary policy, the most important aspect of the GENIUS Act is that it requires U.S.-domiciled issuers to maintain reserves backed on at least a one-to-one basis in safe and liquid U.S. dollar\u00e2\u0080\u0093denominated assets. These reserves can be held in bank deposits, short-term Treasurys, overnight repurchase agreements (repos) or reverse repos backed by U.S. Treasurys, or government money market funds. Depending on the source of funds used to invest in stablecoins, it may constitute new loanable funds in the U.S. economy or the overall amount of money available for borrowing and lending.\nEven stablecoins outside the ambit of the GENIUS Act are likely to boost demand for Treasurys and other dollar-denominated assets. Stablecoins that do not comply with the GENIUS Act can invest reserves in a much broader range of assets but, to be viewed as reliable stores of value, will likely end up still investing substantially in U.S. dollar securities with minimal credit risk.\nThe inter-quartile range of private-sector estimates compiled by Federal Reserve staff roughly projects stablecoin uptake reaching between $1 trillion and $3 trillion by the end of the decade. For reference, the Fed grew its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities by just over $3 trillion during the latest round of quantitative easing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, under $7 trillion in Treasury bills are outstanding today. If these forecasts prove accurate, the magnitude of additional demand from stablecoins will be too large to ignore.\nPotential for Broad Adoption\nThe innovation of public blockchains means that stablecoins can trade freely on rails that anyone in the world can use. This advancement represents potentially transformational change for consumers and businesses outside the U.S., particularly those in emerging market economies (EMEs) or even advanced foreign economies (AFEs) with burdensome restrictions on their payment systems. In many jurisdictions, low-friction payment rails are unavailable. Banking services to convert local currency or assets into dollars may be limited. Basic banking services themselves may be limited. And billions of people worldwide are subject to capital controls preventing convertibility and access to dollars. Globally, savers disproportionately favor dollar-denominated assets, and the ubiquity of capital controls is indicative of that revealed preference.\nFor stablecoins to enter widespread use, there must be a bridge from local fiat currencies into stablecoins. One can imagine many possible bridges, often already in use for existing dollar vehicles: Remittances from immigrants working in the U.S. might take the form of stablecoins; exporters may receive portions of their payment in stablecoins, perhaps undeclared if domiciled in jurisdictions that proscribe stablecoin use; people might trade local currency for cryptocurrency and then use that cryptocurrency to buy a stablecoin; or they might trade physical cash or goods or services or other assets for stablecoins. Stablecoins merely make it easier to traverse some of these bridges and increase incentives for doing so because once stablecoins are in circulation in an economy, they can circulate more freely and cheaply behind capital controls than traditional forms of dollar payments.\n4\nThese bridges will not be frictionless or have infinite capacity. For people who want to use dollars either as a store of value or a means of payment but are unable to do so, stablecoins make it incrementally easier. Stablecoins will not instantly obliterate barriers to dollar use, but they will perforate those barriers.\nReserve assets and currency provided by the U.S. are global public goods, but some jurisdictions prohibit their citizens' enjoyment of them. Stablecoins might establish an easier means for the financially repressed to enjoy these global public goods and evade draconian restrictions on their finances. For individuals and businesses in many nations, especially those in which dollars are used for large purchases like homes, this also leapfrogs the challenges of high and unstable inflation or volatile exchange rates.\nTo be fair, stablecoin growth may not live up to the forecasts I cited earlier. Potential limits on yield and reward arrangements could limit adoption, particularly in open economies. The presumption that the crypto industry will grow at the prodigious rates of recent years cannot be taken for granted. But even with these considerations, it seems likely to me that the growth in stablecoin usage outside the U.S. will continue at a high rate.\nOne important distinction is that if domestically purchased stablecoins are financed with bank deposits, or foreign purchases are financed with existing dollar-denominated holdings, then that doesn't affect the amount of loanable funds in the financial system. Further, there's some risk that a flow of deposits out of the U.S. banking system and into stablecoins could disintermediate banks, affecting the transmission of monetary policy and stunting the velocity of money.\nHowever, because GENIUS Act payment stablecoins do not offer yield and are not backed by federal deposit insurance, I see little prospect of funds broadly fleeing the domestic banking system. The real opportunity in stablecoins is to satiate untapped foreign appetite for dollar assets from savers in jurisdictions where dollar access is limited; by contrast, users in the U.S. and AFEs like the euro zone already freely access Treasurys, dollars, and other instruments that offer yield or deposit insurance. I therefore expect most demand for stablecoins to come from locales unable to access dollar-denominated saving instruments, boosting demand for dollar assets.\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nThe supply\u00e2\u0080\u0093demand balance for loanable funds determines the neutral interest rate, or r*. As I discussed in a recent speech, I believe a range of different factors are putting downward pressure on r* and should be considered in formulating monetary policy.\n5\nSome researchers have tried to estimate how much stablecoin growth might lower interest rates. In 2024, work by Marina Azzimonti and Vincenzo Quadrini estimated that if stablecoins are in widespread use and fully backed by U.S. securities, it could put as much as 40 basis points of downward pressure on interest rates.\n6\nIn estimating the effect of the projected growth of stablecoin issuance on demand for Treasurys and other highly liquid dollar assets, it is helpful to make a comparison to what most researchers believe was a large factor during an era of declining interest rates that began around the turn of the millennium\u00e2\u0080\u0094what former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke called the global saving glut.\n7\nIn measuring the global saving glut, Bernanke reported that the annual U.S. current account deficit widened by 4 percentage points of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) from 1996 to 2004.\n8\nAs I mentioned earlier, projections indicate between $1 trillion to $3 trillion of growth in stablecoins over the next several years. Adoption depends on regulatory clarity, institutional integration, and factors emanating from outside the U.S.\u00e2\u0080\u0094for instance, growth in EMEs, foreign exchange fluctuations, foreign political stability, and so forth.\nAn additional $2 trillion of foreign demand for dollar assets by the end of the decade would, all else equal, increase the current account deficit by roughly 1.2 percentage points of GDP over this period. This increase would represent about 30 percent of the size of the original global saving glut. More bullish stablecoin-uptake forecasts on the order of $4 trillion would double the size of this effect, making it about 60 percent the size of the original global saving glut. These magnitudes would matter for monetary policy.\nDemand could obviously differ in domestic versus foreign adoption or miss these estimates. My goal is not to pinpoint the most accurate forecast, but to highlight the potential power of this channel. You can fill in your own numbers using this same method\u00e2\u0080\u0094my crystal ball is no clearer than others'. Moreover, the asset mix purchased by the rest of the world 20 years ago differs from that purchased by stablecoin issuers. The effects of a lower neutral rate might therefore manifest in financial markets differently than they did last time.\nEven relatively conservative estimates of stablecoin growth imply an increase in the net supply of loanable funds in the economy that pushes down r*. If r* is lower, policy rates should also be lower than they would otherwise be to support a healthy economy. A failure of the central bank to cut rates in response to a reduction in r* is contractionary.\nIf a global stablecoin glut looks like a global saving glut, some other consequences may be replicated, too. For instance, a lower r* increases the odds that the zero lower bound (ZLB) binds in the future, limiting the ability of short-term interest rates to move down to provide accommodation but not restraining their ability to move up to restrict activity. Markets may expect policy to spend more time at the ZLB because of that inability to provide accommodation and get away from zero. That may make the fed funds rate more volatile to the upside with respect to other financial conditions, even as downside volatility remains muted by the ZLB, simulating elements of former Chairman Alan Greenspan's \"conundrum.\"\n9\nMoreover, if a global stablecoin glut is driven by flows out of foreign currencies and into the U.S. dollar, it will, all else equal, make the dollar stronger. Depending on the strength of this effect relative to other forces affecting the Fed's price-stability and maximum-employment mandates, that might be something that monetary policy reacts to.\nFinally, incremental dollarization may reduce the benefits of floating exchange rates. Exchange rates often function as shock absorbers, adjusting rapidly to changes in relative conditions across countries so that nominal prices don't have to. If nominal prices are sticky and exchange rates are not, the cyclical distortions associated with those rigidities are less detrimental for the economy. Increased real price rigidity because exchange rates cannot adjust would intensify the volatility of global business cycles. And Fed policy will have a greater effect on foreign economic growth with greater dollarization, increasing business cycle synchronization. Whether this phenomenon would matter for the U.S. and not just for countries that dollarize a portion of their economies remains speculative.\n10\nAmerica's capital markets are the world's deepest, helping to support economic growth, fund new ideas, and allocate capital efficiently. However, our financial infrastructure, not unlike our physical infrastructure, could use a reboot. Stablecoins may well lead the way on this front, facilitating dollar holdings and payments domestically and abroad. While there has been extensive research on the topic since the advent of stablecoins a decade ago, the scope for rapid increases in issuance makes it now even more imperative to consider what widespread adoption may mean for ",

Jefferson\nAt Euro20+, Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, President Nagel and the Bundesbank, for the opportunity to meet with you today.\n1\nI am excited to be here. I cherish opportunities to talk with groups of young people such as this. I spent most of my career as a professor and university administrator. I am glad to return to those roots a bit today. I will make sure I leave plenty of time for questions. But I would like to start by speaking with you about a topic that's been on my mind, and I bet it has been on many of yours: artificial intelligence (AI).\nOften, when I gather with students, consumers, or businesspeople, the conversation quickly turns to AI. And it is easy to understand why\u00e2\u0080\u0094you do not even need to ask a chatbot! AI has the potential to transform how we work and how we live, and it could have a profound effect on the economy. Today, I will talk about AI's rapid growth and how I approach thinking about AI by examining it through the lens of the dual mandate given to the Federal Reserve by the U.S. Congress. That mandate instructs America's central bank to pursue maximum employment and price stability. I will describe the effects that AI may have on both sides of that mandate. Finally, I will briefly update you on my economic outlook before turning to your questions.\nAI's Rapid Growth\nIn a few short years, AI morphed from the realm of science fiction to a tool that high schoolers use to help them do their science homework! Seriously, it is amazing to see school children use AI to generate quizzes to prepare for exams, home chefs use it to create recipes for a wholesome dinner, and jobseekers use it to consider career tradeoffs, among many other purposes. Consumer use of AI has grown rapidly, and it is integrated into a multitude of existing products, including search engines, phones, and vehicles.\nAs of last month, ChatGPT, which is just one of a growing number of generative AI models, is used by more than 800 million people every week, an increase from 500 million a week at the end of March.\n2\nEnterprise use of AI has been growing too. A recently released study showed that the proportion of Americans using AI at their jobs has also been growing at a fast clip. Researchers found that workers' adoption of generative AI rose from 30.1 percent as of December 2024 to 45.9 percent as of June and July of this year.\n3\nAnd among survey respondents who had adopted AI tools, about a third said they use them daily. That same study found that AI is most used at jobs by younger, more highly educated, and higher-earning workers and that productivity for workers increased substantially when using AI tools.\nThere is strong evidence that AI can increase labor productivity in various industries and occupations. For example, a paper from Stanford economist, Erik Brynjolfsson, and coauthors showed the effects of AI implementation among customer support agents.\n4\nThey found that AI tools increased productivity\u00e2\u0080\u0094as measured by issues resolved per hour\u00e2\u0080\u009414 percent, on average, and the improvement in productivity for novice and low-skilled employees was much larger.\nAI is also advancing productivity in highly technical scientific research. Take protein folding, for example. Proteins are the building blocks of the human body and life itself. They assume an almost infinite variety of shapes. Predicting those shapes\u00e2\u0080\u0094which determine their function\u00e2\u0080\u0094is vital for understanding how cells and diseases work and for finding drugs to treat them. Just five years ago, scientists had a good understanding of the structures of just 17 percent of the roughly 20,000 proteins in the human body.\n5\nFor each protein, that knowledge was earned through months or years of hard work and a potential cost of tens of thousands of dollars or more. Thanks to the development of the AlphaFold model, an AI system that predicts a protein's structure, scientists now know the structures of all the proteins in the human body\u00e2\u0080\u0094and some 200 million more.\n6\nMore broadly, like many others, I see the promise for AI technology to be transformative, perhaps in ways as dramatic as past technological achievements, such as the printing press, steam engine, and the Internet, which are known as general purpose technologies for their wide-ranging effects.\nLabor Market and Prices\nWhen I think about this technology, I consider how it will affect both sides of the Fed's dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. As such, it is something that economists and policymakers must monitor.\nAI can allow a worker to complete tasks in moments that previously took many minutes, if not hours. That has caused many to question whether AI will lead to notable job loss. This potential disruption of labor is a real risk. By automating certain tasks, it could lead to a reduction in some types of jobs. But increased productivity leads to economic growth, which may create new employment opportunities. AI is also expected to create new job categories and transform existing ones. There has been robust competition among high-tech firms for workers who possess the skills to develop this technology.\n7\nMany have legitimate concerns that AI will cause job loss. At least for certain firms and workers in certain occupations, this is likely to be true. There are many examples where transformative technologies, such as the personal computer, did cause some workers to lose their jobs, but we also saw new industries and occupations emerge because of the innovation. Indeed, some large employers have recently indicated they are lowering overall hiring plans in light of advances in AI and other forms of automation.\n8\nSome research has also suggested that AI is having a more detrimental effect on the job prospects of younger, less experienced workers, including recent graduates, relative to those further along in their careers.\n9\nThe net effect on employment is highly uncertain and may show variation across industries and occupations over time. For the overall economy, one way to think about AI-related job losses\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least until it creates new jobs\u00e2\u0080\u0094is that it can create economic slack. In a world where firms only deployed AI to replace existing workers, even at a lower level of overall employment, the productive capacity of the economy has increased (or stayed the same). Of course, if people seamlessly get redeployed to more productive tasks, the economy produces more without any additional slack\u00e2\u0080\u0094more on this soon. Whether AI substitutes for labor or complements it is an important question that requires continued study.\nOn the other side of our dual mandate, price stability, AI could help the economy achieve higher growth through increased productivity while reducing inflationary pressures. Specifically, increased productivity could lower production costs and put downward pressure on prices. Not only could AI allow a specific worker to be more efficient in their day-to-day tasks, but it also has the potential to allow for better thinking around complex problems\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, in logistics and transportation. More efficient allocation of resources as well as potential improvements in supply chains could reduce associated costs, leading to lower prices for various goods and services. Conversely, AI could put upward pressure on certain price categories as many firms push to scale up the technology. I mentioned the rising wages for certain workers with skills that complement AI. AI technology also requires data centers, which compete with other production processes for land, energy, and other inputs. So, I think that AI's effect on inflation is not solely downward pressure.\nImplications for monetary policy\nSo, what do these still-developing labor and price effects mean for monetary policy? The short answer is that it is likely still too soon to tell. As always, policymakers confront the challenge of sorting out changes in the economy that are due to cyclical factors from those resulting from structural change, which AI may well represent. Some of the recent changes in hiring patterns, productivity growth, and inflation are likely to represent AI-driven change, but it is difficult to know the degree.\nProductivity gains from AI may affect the relationship between employment and inflation and hence the conduct of monetary policy. For example, a productivity-induced boost to the growth rate of potential output could imply that monetary policy will not need to react strongly to what would have previously been perceived as tightness in the labor market.\nThe uncertain implications of AI for employment and inflation could take some time to filter broadly through economy. Also, AI's effects will likely vary across different industries and regions of both the U.S. and the world. And monetary policy decisions need to be made with a broad view of what is happening in the economy, not just in one sector or technology. There is still much to learn. I counsel exercising humility about the challenges in predicting AI's effects on employment and inflation. Policymakers, businesses, and individuals should remain flexible and prepared to adapt as the effects of AI continue to unfold.\nEconomic Outlook\nNow having discussed the policy implications of AI, I would like to briefly update you about my current outlook for the U.S. economy. While federal statistical agencies are largely not producing data during the government shutdown, data available from other sources suggest that the overall economic picture in the U.S. has not changed much over the past few months. The economy has been growing at a moderate pace while labor market conditions appear to be consistent with a gradually cooling. Inflation is running at a rate similar to that of a year ago. The lack of progress on headline inflation appears to be due to tariff effects, with signs that underlying inflation may be continuing to make progress to 2 percent. Market-based long-term inflation expectations continue to be well-anchored. I remain firmly committed to returning inflation to the Fed's 2 percent target.\nI supported last week's decision to reduce our policy rate by a quarter percentage point. That step was appropriate because I see the balance of risks as having shifted in recent months as downside risks to employment have increased. The current policy stance is still somewhat restrictive, but we have moved it closer to its neutral level that neither restricts nor stimulates the economy. Given this, it makes sense to proceed slowly as we approach the neutral rate.\nWith respect to the path of the policy rate going forward, I will continue to determine policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. I always take a meeting-by-meeting approach. This approach is especially prudent because it is unclear how much official data we will have before our December meeting.\nBefore I turn to your questions, let me conclude by saying that this is an exciting time. It feels like we are at the dawn of a new age\u00e2\u0080\u0094an age your generation will shape and see come to its full maturity. By the end of your careers, many of you will take on tasks and accomplish feats you cannot even imagine at this moment, and AI technology may well be part of that progress.\nThank you again for having me. It is an honor to be here. I am looking forward to our discussion.\n1.

Cook\nAt The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, David. I appreciate the opportunity to speak again at the Brookings Institution.\n1\nIt is always an honor for me to return to the place where I held my first job as an aspiring economist. I had the good fortune to be a research assistant for the eminent economist and public servant, including as Vice Chair of the Fed, Alice Rivlin early in my career. It was a formative, if not transformative, experience for me, and I remain grateful to her and Brookings for it.\nToday, I would like to speak to you about how I see the U.S. economic outlook evolving, specifically through the lens of the dual mandate given to the Federal Reserve by Congress to promote maximum employment and price stability. Then, I will discuss how my assessment of the outlook guides my thinking on monetary policy.\nI will start by acknowledging that, due to the government shutdown, this is a challenging time to give an economic outlook speech. Federal statistical agencies, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, have not produced many of the data I regularly use in assessing the economy, such as monthly employment data from BLS and the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index from BEA. The longer the shutdown lasts, the more data could be disrupted.\nEconomic Outlook\nHowever, we are not flying blind. The staff at the Federal Reserve and I use a wide variety of data from administrative sources and various private-sector providers to continually evaluate the state of the economy in real time. That practice has become essential in recent weeks given the lack of official releases. These data include alternative measures of inflation, labor-market activity, and production and spending, inflation. For example, states continue to report data on unemployment insurance (UI) claims, and online job boards provide data on available positions. Various firms provide pricing data on a variety of products and services, including housing and vehicles, and offer information on credit card spending, the moods of consumers and employers, and manufacturing and service-sector output. In my first speech as a Governor in 2022, I encouraged the use of more high-frequency, real-time data from the private sector, and I think this has borne fruit.\n2\nAnd, of course, the Reserve Banks in the Fed System are a rich source of statistical and anecdotal data, some of which are documented in the Beige Book report policymakers receive before each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.\nIn addition, I find broad outreach to business leaders, workers, nonprofits, and families around the country essential in understanding the state of the economy. I will rely on this outreach, these alternative data sources, and the latest available federal data when discussing my outlook today.\nInflation\nFirst, I will turn to inflation. Based on the available data for September, it is estimated that the PCE price index rose 2.8 percent in the 12 months ending in September, significantly above our 2 percent target. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, was also estimated to be 2.8 percent. Both of these readings are as high or higher than their readings a year before, propped up by an increase in tariff-affected goods prices.\nMy outreach to business leaders suggests that the pass-through of tariffs to consumer prices is not yet complete. Many firms have adopted a strategy of running down their inventories at lower price levels before raising prices. Others have reported waiting until tariff uncertainty is resolved before passing increases on to consumers. New car models, clothing lines, and other products will be coming onto the market, and that process will continue to provide firms with an opportunity to level set prices. As such, I expect inflation to remain elevated for the next year.\nNonetheless, the effect of tariffs on prices, in theory, should represent a one-time increase. It is encouraging that most long-run inflation expectations, including from the New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations, are low and stable at this juncture. When excluding tariff effects, 12-month core PCE inflation through September appears to be about 1/2 percentage point lower at about 2.3 percent, suggesting that underlying inflation has continued to make progress toward target. My assessment is that inflation is on track to continue on its trend toward our target of 2 percent once the tariff effects are behind us. The big caveat is that tariff effects must prove not to be persistent and that monetary policy remains appropriately focused on achieving that goal.\nThis is a point worth dwelling on for just a moment. The FOMC's firm commitment to its inflation mandate is imperative to ensure that inflation does remain in check, as I do expect in my baseline forecast. So let me be clear. I am committed to reaching our 2 percent inflation target. Moreover, I will be prepared to act forcefully, if the tariff effects appear to be larger or last longer than expected, or if other evidence emerges that higher levels of inflation are becoming entrenched in expectations.\nLabor market\nI will now turn to the labor market. We have less recent official data on the labor market, but the latest available indicators suggest that the labor market remains solid, though gradually cooling. The unemployment rate edged up over this summer from 4.1 percent in June to 4.3 percent in August, a relatively low reading one would expect to see in a healthy economy. To put 4.3 percent into perspective, the average unemployment rate over the 50-year period preceding the pandemic was 6.2 percent. Since August, more recent labor-market indicators, such as UI claims, job postings, and individuals' assessments of job availability, signal little change to the August reading\u00e2\u0080\u0094at most a small uptick. Taken together, the slightly rising unemployment rate indicates the labor market is softening, but only modestly so.\nI would be remiss if I did not mention slowing in payroll gains observed over the summer. In most cases, a sharp slowing in payrolls would suggest increasing slack and would generally be accompanied by an increase in the unemployment rate. However, in this instance, the slowing in payrolls can mostly be explained by a coincident decline in population growth due to immigration policy. Because they are currently driven by fluctuations in population growth, the payroll numbers do not provide a definitive signal about labor-market slack. Therefore, it would be prudent for us to consult the other indicators I already mentioned.\nIt is important to recognize that there appear to be worsening outcomes for vulnerable and low-to-middle-income (LMI) households. In the labor market, youth and Black unemployment rates, both of which tend to be more cyclical than total unemployment, have steadily risen since this spring through the latest readings in August. The deteriorating labor market experienced by these two vulnerable groups mirrors other emerging strains in some households' financial health and balance sheets. Among LMI households, we have observed large increases in delinquencies, especially last year, and there is some evidence that their spending has stagnated, in particular compared to the robust spending growth of their higher-income counterparts. This is sometimes called a \"two-speed\" economy, when the well-off are doing well, while LMI and vulnerable households are not.\nMonetary policy works by affecting conditions for the entire economy and is not well suited to produce specific outcomes for specific groups of people. Ultimately, I believe delivering on our dual-mandate goals will produce the best outcomes for all Americans. Nonetheless, it is important for policymakers to monitor the two-speed economy. Understanding the challenges faced by so many Americans underscores the reasons why we need to get monetary policy right. Vulnerable and LMI households are the ones who will be the first and most hurt, if the labor market were to suddenly deteriorate or if inflation were to remain too high.\nEconomic activity\nTo turn to economic activity, recent readings are consistent with solid overall growth. Output has been supported by household consumption that has held up better than expected earlier this year. Yet, what has been more striking is the strength of business investment. Business investment has been driven by investment in high-tech equipment and software, seemingly mostly related to AI. As I have mentioned in previous speeches, that suggests to me there is a reason to be sanguine about future productivity growth.\n3\nI see AI as a general-purpose technology, on par with the steam engine and the personal computer, that has the\npotential\nto transform the economy and boost productivity. I expect this sector to continue to provide support to output growth over the next few years, at least.\nIn the very near term, I see the federal government shutdown as weighing on activity this quarter. Furloughing federal workers and forgoing government purchases of goods and services, including those provided by contractors, directly lowers output in the public sector. And spillover effects to the private sector are worth considering. Potential delays in government payments, permits, inspections, insurance provision and other functions could slow certain spending and investment activities, and some small business contractors with very little cushion may never be paid and may ultimately close their businesses. I see both sets of effects as being largely temporary. It is anticipated that they would unwind in the following quarter after the shutdown ends.\nIn summary, after a temporary slowdown due to the government shutdown, I expect the economy to grow moderately over the medium term, supported by an AI productivity boom. I see the labor market as still solid, but I am highly attentive to downside risks. I see inflation as remaining somewhat elevated due to tariff effects and subject to upside risks.\nMonetary Policy\nHaving articulated my outlook, I will turn to my current view of monetary policy. At the FOMC meeting last week, I supported the Committee's decision to lower the target range for the fed funds rate by a quarter-point to 3-3/4 to 4 percent. I viewed that decision as appropriate, because I believe that the downside risks to employment are greater than the upside risks to inflation. I view the latest reduction in the fed funds rate as another gradual step toward normalization. I see the current policy rate as remaining modestly restrictive, which is appropriate given that inflation remains somewhat above our 2 percent target.\nAt last week's meeting, I also supported the decision to conclude the reduction of the aggregate securities holdings on the balance sheet on December 1. The long-stated plan had been to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves were somewhat above the level the Committee deemed consistent with ample reserve conditions. In the several weeks ahead of our latest meeting, signs, such as an increase in repo rates relative to administered rates, did emerge suggesting this standard had been reached. These developments were anticipated as the size of the balance sheet declined and supported the decision to cease runoff.\nLooking ahead, policy is not on a predetermined path. We are at a moment when risks to both sides of the dual mandate are elevated. Keeping rates too high increases the likelihood that the labor market will deteriorate sharply. Lowering rates too much would increase the likelihood that inflation expectations will become unanchored. As always, I determine my monetary policy stance each meeting based on the incoming data from a wide variety of sources, the evolution of my outlook, and the balance of risks. Every meeting, including December's, is a live meeting.\nThank you again for the opportunity to return to Brookings. I look forward to our conversation.\n1.

The growth of these requirements has imposed unnecessary and significant costs on banks and their customers. I have spoken about my principles for supervision and regulation, which will continue to guide my approach to supervision and the bank regulatory framework. At the core of these principles is pragmatism, which focuses on first identifying the problem each new and existing regulation intends to solve and then reviewing and updating regulations as industries and conditions change. Once we have identified a need for reform, or a problem to be solved, our next task is to conduct a careful analysis of the intended and unintended consequences of any proposed policy solution and to consider alternative approaches that lead to lower costs or better outcomes.\nThe EGRPRA process is the opportunity to do just this\u00e2\u0080\u0094take a step back and review our frameworks with fresh eyes to eliminate unnecessary and outdated regulations and reduce burden. The bank regulatory framework must strike a balance between encouraging economic growth and innovation while guaranteeing the safety, soundness, and stability of the banking system.\nOne of the primary goals of the EGRPRA process is to maintain the regulatory framework to ensure it continues to be fit for purpose. As I've noted previously, system maintenance is something we should embrace. When regulators establish rules and guidance, they devote significant time, resources, and analysis to evaluate the costs and benefits of new proposals. However, insufficient focus is given to updating and refining these frameworks. Ideally, regulators should be adapting the regulatory structure to ensure the existing plumbing continues to work, considering how different regulations interact with each other, reflecting changes in the evolving financial landscape, or accommodating innovations such as new financial products, services, or market participants. So, our work to maintain an effective bank regulatory framework is never really complete. If regulators do not consistently reassess what is already in place, it can prevent us from meeting our statutory obligation to promote a safe and sound banking system that enables banks to serve their customers effectively and efficiently.\nOver time, some of our regulations have unduly restrained the activities that banks can engage in, incentivizing banks to limit those activities and pushing those functions outside of the banking system. We need to ask whether this is appropriate. Similarly, the buildup of complexity in our regulatory system is also felt most acutely by community banks. When our regulatory system is not appropriately tailored to the size, risk, complexity, and business model of the institutions we supervise and regulate, we impede the effectiveness of their operations. This can result in preventing banks from providing competitive products and services, innovating, and engaging in appropriate risk-taking. Incorporating graduated requirements avoids disproportionately burdening smaller institutions.\nThe current EGRPRA review is the third time the agencies have undertaken a comprehensive review of the bank regulatory system. The two prior reviews were underwhelming, resulting in no reduction in regulatory burden. This is an unacceptable outcome. We must take this process seriously, and through it, actually identify opportunities for change that will have lasting impact. We are implementing the current process to provide meaningful engagement for stakeholders to identify regulatory changes that result in less complexity, lower compliance costs, and increased efficiency while also maintaining safety and soundness.\nAs part of the current review, the agencies have issued four Federal Register notices and held two virtual outreach meetings. We have received comments from many stakeholders including banks, trade groups, and community organizations. This broad range of commenters demonstrates the important role of the banking system in the lives of all Americans. We must strike the right balance and be responsive to public comments and through outreach meetings like this meeting today.\nA significant portion of the comments received so far highlight areas of regulation that I have targeted for revisiting. Many of the Board's regulations have not been comprehensively reviewed or updated in more than 20 years. Given the dynamic nature of the banking system and how the economy and banking industry have evolved over that period, we should update and simplify many of the Board's regulations, including thresholds for applicability and benchmarks. These thresholds should also be indexed to account for economic growth and inflation.\nCommenters have offered suggestions to address a number of areas, including issues with the Board's supervisory framework, regulatory capital, and the applications process. They have also discussed more specific issues ranging from outdated guidelines on loans to insiders, bank activities, and anti-money laundering requirements. Many commenters have also remarked on the excessive burden created by information and regulatory data collections, with an emphasis on the Call Report and other information collections. We are carefully considering these comments and are evaluating ways to address related unnecessary regulatory burdens.\nWith this feedback in mind, the Board is already working to update and streamline many of these requirements. For example, on regulatory capital, we are pursuing several initiatives, including considering modifications to the Community Bank Leverage Ratio, changes to our stress testing process to reduce volatility of capital requirements, and making proposed changes to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio. The Board also recently issued an FAQ to provide transparency and clarify the considerations a mutual banking organization should evaluate when proposing to issue a mutual capital instrument. We are also prioritizing work to assist in the fight against fraud and considering ways to streamline the mergers, acquisitions, and de-novo formations review and approval process.\nThe Board is also committed to refocusing our supervisory process on material financial risks rather than procedural or documentation issues and identifying and eliminating the hidden costs and extra-regulatory burdens implemented through supervision. As part of this initiative, the Board has initiated changes to our large bank ratings framework to better align it with other supervisory ratings systems and ensure large banks' ratings reflect their financial conditions and risks. In addition, we and the other FFIEC agencies are reviewing the CAMELS ratings system, which is long past due for reform. The Board has also taken steps to ensure our supervisory framework is supportive of innovation in the banking system, and we have ended the use of reputational risk in our supervisory program to guarantee fair access to the banking system for all Americans.\nLooking ahead, the Board will review a broad set of issues to ensure our regulatory framework and supervisory approaches are appropriately tailored and transparent. Through the EGRPRA process, we have a meaningful opportunity to reduce unnecessary and outdated regulatory requirements. Our responsibility is to promote safety and soundness and consider the broader context of promoting an effective and efficient banking system that supports market functioning and encourages economic growth, business creation and expansion, and opportunity.\nI continue to prioritize outreach to banks of all sizes, especially community banks, because your voice must be a part of the conversation in Washington to shape a regulatory framework that fosters growth and innovation. We look forward to engaging on your comments and concerns and constructive ideas for further improvements.\nThank you for your participation.\n1.

Barr\nAt the 2025 Fall New Markets Tax Credit Conference, New Orleans, Louisiana\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for asking me to be part of this celebration of 25 years of the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) and also the historic achievement of its permanent extension.\n1\nI consider the credit a great achievement for communities all across the United States. I'm honored to be here with you celebrating its legacy of bringing jobs and opportunity to lower-income communities\u00e2\u0080\u0094a lasting impact that benefits all Americans.\nBefore I talk about the NMTC itself, let's go back and remember some history of how it came about. In the 1990s, there was a lot of partisan conflict about federal anti-poverty programs. President Clinton believed there should be some common ground on some ways to fight poverty, and the New Markets Initiative was one of them. At the time, America was trying to create jobs by opening up markets abroad for U.S. exporters, and what became the NMTC was dedicated to the idea that there were also promising new markets to invest in right here at home, in underinvested communities.\nI still remember fondly one trip I took with the President to highlight the possibilities for investment in underserved communities. At one stop in Clarksdale, Mississippi, in a sweltering furniture factory we heard from entrepreneurs looking for new capital, from community development financial institutions looking for new sources of capital to help entrepreneurs, and from community lenders looking to grow their local economy. Their enthusiasm was infectious.\nOne reason the NMTC has succeeded is that, from the beginning, it had very broad support. Lower-income communities in both rural and urban areas had the vision to support economic development but lacked the investment. The comprehensive geographical reach helped the NMTC to have broad bipartisan support. Republicans and Democrats both supported using the tax code to create economic incentives, especially those that incentivize investment intended to create jobs. When the bill passed, a Republican lawmaker who voted for it called the NMTC \"the most effective anti-poverty package coming out the federal government\u00e2\u0080\u00a6in a generation.\"\n2\nThat person was then Representative Jim Talent, who is with us today. While the NMTC quickly proved effective at attracting investment to communities, its biggest challenge was being created as a temporary program\u00e2\u0080\u0094requiring a major effort every few years to secure reauthorization. But now, the NMTC has been permanently enacted. I believe that will usher in a new era of stability for the NMTC and thus growth for investments in low-income communities.\nA second reason for the NMTC's support, I believe, was its design as a public\u00e2\u0080\u0093private partnership. Communities are more than the sum of their different parts. They are the product of all these parts working together, and the key to successful community development is designing programs that involve and mobilize every part of a community. In my experience, the backbone of many successful community development initiatives is the combination of government, groups representing the people of the community, and the businesses that provide most of the jobs and livelihoods in any community. When everyone has a stake in the outcome, that is when good things start happening.\nThe NMTC is such a public\u00e2\u0080\u0093private partnership. It starts from the ground up\u00e2\u0080\u0094local community development groups and business leaders with a history of commitment to the community are the spur. To work effectively in so many different places with such a broad range of conditions and needs, it has to be a program that really works.\nThe NMTC succeeds because it is premised on the conviction that there are real investment opportunities in lower-income communities. The belief that there are smart, hard-working, and capable people eager to support a new or expanded enterprise. That there is affordable real estate, in some cases commercial or industrial buildings, and extensive infrastructure that have been underutilized. The conviction that there are communities that will unite to support new businesses as markets themselves for the goods and services these businesses provide.\nThe 39 percent tax incentive at the heart of the NMTC, paid out over seven years, plays a critical role in attracting investors to these advantages. It's often the critical factor that makes those investments work. The NMTC is the foot in the door for communities trying to get the attention of investors who can start or expand their businesses anywhere. It is the extra incentive that is needed for investors to look under the hood and recognize all the good reasons why a particular community would be a great place to do business. The NMTC unlocks the undercounted, underappreciated potential of so many communities. That's good for investors, good for communities, and good for the U.S. economy. And let me say also\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is just good. Good for an America that believes in opportunity and everyone living up to their potential.\nI like to think about what each of those businesses means to the community to which it was brought by the NMTC. Anyone who has done the hard work of economic development in lower-income communities knows that getting such an investment is a huge achievement. It makes communities stand out and says to others that maybe this would be a good place for more investment. I also like to think about what one of those million jobs the NMTC helped to create can mean to the individual who gets it and to their family. Maybe learning a new skill, an entirely new occupation, or even getting a second chance to use skills they already have that perhaps haven't been demanded lately in the community. Such an opportunity can be life changing.\nOne person whose life was changed by the NMTC and our broader work on community development at the Treasury Department was me. I didn't know exactly what I was going to do when I went to work for Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin in 1995. But they needed someone to help the Treasury empower local communities, and I was thrilled to say yes. And my work over the next six years really did change my life. In every job I have ever had since, inside and outside government, community development has played a significant role. As a professor and dean at the University of Michigan, I wrote about community development and consumer protection and helped launch an initiative to help entrepreneurs in Detroit. When I returned to Washington to help deal with the effects of the Great Financial Crisis, I never forgot, for a moment, how the greatest harm from that catastrophe was inflicted on lower-income families and their communities. When Congress was writing the Dodd-Frank Act, I pushed hard to ensure it would create new protections for lower- and middle-income borrowers, and I wrote a book about the tenuous finances of lower-income people with no financial slack trying to make their way in the economy.\nThe Federal Reserve System, which includes our 12 regional Reserve Banks, has a community development mission, and I recently took over responsibility for that function on behalf of the Fed's Board of Governors. The Fed's responsibilities in promoting a healthy economy and strong and stable financial system require that we monitor conditions throughout the United States, and that includes in low-income communities. It has given me the opportunity to connect with community leaders and community development groups all across the country, hear about their challenges, and also their hopes and plans for the future.\nThis work has reminded me again that America really is its communities and that community development is essential to a thriving and prosperous America. Those are goals that the New Markets Tax Credit has helped advance for a quarter-century, and I am very pleased that this conference can mark the beginning of another 25 years of the NMTC bringing new investment and new opportunity to communities.\nThank you.\n1.

The Fed has an important role in implementing a series of laws passed by Congress related to access to credit, including the Community Reinvestment Act. Today, I will share my perspective on the critical role that bank accounts, faster payments, and small-dollar loans can play in serving the needs of low- and moderate-income communities.\nThe ability to manage personal financial decisions safely and dependably begins with access to a bank account. One program that has been successful in expanding account access is Bank On, supported by the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund (CFE Fund). Bank On accounts certified by the CFE Fund meet standards including low minimum deposits for account opening and low maintenance, overdraft, and other unexpected fees. The Bank On National Data (BOND) Hub, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, is a critical data set that helps us understand how financial institutions are expanding access to low-cost banking for consumers.\n2\nIt also helps us better understand how this access directly benefits different households in numerous ways.\nBeyond account access, innovations such as more efficient payments systems, small dollar loans, and underwriting loans using alternative data, such as cash flows facilitate greater financial inclusion for consumers.\nThe ability to move money faster can empower households by providing them with more control over financial inflows and outflows\u00e2\u0080\u0094receiving their income and paying their bills. Better control over their financial lives can reduce knock-on effects from financial volatility, particularly for low-to-moderate income households with less financial slack.\nLikewise, products like bank-offered small-dollar loans can provide affordable, short-term liquidity to cover emergencies and unexpected expenses. Data from the Fed's 2024 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking provide insights into how households might handle a small-dollar liquidity need. The short answer is it would be tough for many households. When asked how they would respond if confronted with an unexpected $400 expense, nearly 20 percent of adults said they would have paid at least in part by selling something, using a payday loan, deposit advance, or overdraft. When looking at households with incomes of under $25,000, this number increased to 46 percent.\n3\nA bank-offered small-dollar loan could provide help to these households. Some banks have begun offering small-dollar loans that are partially or wholly underwritten using alternative financial data, such as cash-flows, including deposits, paying rent and utilities, and the like. This type of underwriting can help assess the creditworthiness of consumers with thin or no credit files. Additionally, cash-flow underwriting can help banks offer a \"second look\" for consumers who would otherwise not qualify based on more traditional credit-score-based underwriting models. Beyond expanding the pool of eligible consumers, loans underwritten using alternative financial data can lead to less expensive and faster loan underwriting. A safe, reasonably priced, and transparent small-dollar loan could help consumers better navigate the burden of emergency expenses.\nI've mentioned a few ways that financial services can help improve the financial health of low-and moderate-income households\u00e2\u0080\u0094through safe and affordable bank accounts, faster payments, and small-dollar loans. Thank you for the work you are doing to understand how to better serve households and small businesses in a wide variety of ways. Better access to financial services can help communities to thrive. I hope to see continued collaboration among the Federal Reserve System and myriad stakeholders, including all of you. Through our shared efforts, we can continue to advance financial inclusion for all communities. Thank you.\n1.

Early on, while at the Treasury Department, I worked with colleagues to help stand up the CDFI Fund, strengthen the Community Reinvestment Act, and launch the New Markets Tax Credit. When I returned to Treasury years later, I got a chance once again to work with the talented staff of the CDFI Fund, people whose dedication to expanding economic opportunity was truly inspiring. And over the last three decades, and now at the Federal Reserve, I've seen firsthand how CDFIs around the country help small businesses to thrive and communities to prosper.\nCDFIs emerged as a creative solution to a fundamental challenge: how to get credit flowing into places where mainstream finance has not always reached. Through flexible underwriting, tailored lending, and deep community development relationships, CDFIs meet credit needs through good times and bad. CDFIs help fuel the revitalization of neighborhoods, small businesses, and local economies.\nWhen I travel around the country as a Fed Governor, I often meet with local community leaders, including local CDFIs. I've seen CDFIs serving rural areas, such as the Mississippi Delta, where CDFIs have stepped in as traditional bank branches have closed. I've heard small businesses in urban areas such as Atlanta praise the work of CDFIs helping them get access to capital, skills development, and business opportunities that were otherwise unavailable. I've seen countless examples of CDFIs helping to build affordable housing, daycare centers, and revitalize neighborhoods, in communities from Hartford, Connecticut to Dallas, Texas.\nCDFIs operate all over the nation, including in Indian Country. The Federal Reserve's Center for Indian Country Development has done remarkable work documenting the power of CDFIs in Native communities. Some of the solutions they've designed include seasonal payment structures for fishermen and loggers, accepting tribal distribution payments as collateral, or creating land buy-back loans. One Native CDFI leader described their work as \"blending culture with finance\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I think that captures beautifully what makes the CDFI model so powerful.\nAnd when economic downturns come\u00e2\u0080\u0094as they inevitably do\u00e2\u0080\u0094CDFIs are often the first to step up. During the foreclosure crisis, they maintained lending and provided critical support to homeowners who otherwise could not or would not be served. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, CDFIs once again acted as first responders, rapidly delivering relief to small businesses.\nCDFIs have earned their strong track record through performance and results \u00e2\u0080\u0094 delivering impact in rural areas, urban neighborhoods, and tribal communities across the country. Demand for their services continues to grow.\nThe story of the CDFI movement is one of persistence, creativity, and partnership\u00e2\u0080\u0094qualities that will serve us well in the years ahead. Together, we can build on this strong foundation to ensure that opportunity reaches every community and that the legacy of inclusive finance continues for generations to come.\nThank you for your leadership, your commitment, and for the work you do every day to make that vision a reality.\n1.

It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Board for our first Payments Innovation Conference.\n1\nMy objective in creating this conference is twofold. First, I wanted to have a conference that focused on the new technologies that have come from the defi and crypto worlds and how they are entering the mainstream payments ecosystem. My goal is to have a vibrant discussion about payments between the traditional payment incumbents and the new entrants from the defi world. Second, I wanted to send a message that this is a new era for the Federal Reserve in payments\u00e2\u0080\u0094the defi industry is not viewed with suspicion or scorn. Rather, today, you are welcomed to the conversation on the future of payments in the United States and on our home field\u00e2\u0080\u0094something that would have been unimaginable a few years ago.\nAs you all know, we are well into a technology-driven revolution in payments, and I am here to say that the Federal Reserve intends to be an active part of that revolution.\nA number of technological advances are transforming the payment system. Stablecoins and tokenized assets making use of distributed ledger technology. The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). And, increasingly, the convergence between these innovations and the traditional financial ecosystem. This includes the institutions and infrastructure that our economy has long depended on to operate a safe and efficient payment system. And, yes, this also includes the Federal Reserve. The revolution transforming payments is demanding change everywhere, and I will say more in a moment about some new ideas that the Federal Reserve is studying to support these innovations.\nI have spoken before about what I see as the two broad models of payments innovation in our market economy.\n2\nThe first is private-sector-driven innovation. Most innovation comes from the private sector, which is motivated and best positioned to allocate resources and take risks to explore new technologies. The second model is when public-sector entities such as the Fed build platforms and provide services that enable the private sector to more readily and rapidly expand new services to its customers. This should be done rarely and in limited circumstances where it addresses a specific market need. The posture of public institutions, including the Federal Reserve, should be to acknowledge and embrace private-sector innovation that can improve the payment system while preserving its safety and stability, which are as essential to the new generation of innovators as they are to legacy institutions.\nLet me pull back a moment and remind everyone how we got here. Since nearly its founding, the Federal Reserve System has worked to facilitate payment and settlement system efficiency alongside the private sector. From the beginning, the clearing services provided by Reserve Banks obviated the need for daily movements of cash in armored cars with heavily armed guards. Long before we started speaking of the \"payment rails\" that are facilitating the kind of innovation we will be discussing today, the Fed was running trains on steel rails to deliver and clear paper checks traveling across the country. Fedwire began conducting interbank transfers through telegraph wires in the early 20th century. Fast forward to today, where we have multiple infrastructures that settle interbank transfers in real time.\nToday's conference will focus on private-sector-driven innovation. We have assembled 100 private-sector innovators who are leveraging cutting-edge technology to create new possibilities in the payments landscape. Our panelists are engaged in integrating traditional financial payment rails with distributed ledgers, developing new products and services in the digital asset ecosystem, and leveraging AI in the payments landscape.\nIt's worth noting that the firms engaged in these activities include banks, asset managers, retail payments firms, technology companies, as well as crypto-native fintechs. This is an acknowledgement that distributed ledgers and crypto-assets are no longer on the fringes but increasingly are woven into the fabric of the payment and financial systems.\nBefore we hear from these innovators, I would like to touch on the roles that the Federal Reserve plays to support the private sector. These include serving as a convener to solve coordination problems and operating core payment and settlement infrastructure. We are also looking ahead, conducting hands-on research on tokenization, smart contracts, and the intersection of AI and payments for use in our own payment systems. We do this to understand the innovation happening within the payment system as well as to evaluate whether these technologies could provide opportunities to upgrade our own payment infrastructures and to enable us to have deeper conversations with the industry on these new technologies.\nWhile this is a good start, I believe we can and should do more to support those actively transforming the payment system. To that end, I have asked Federal Reserve staff to explore the idea of what I am calling a \"payment account.\" Today, Federal Reserve Banks provide access to master accounts and financial services to legally eligible entities following our Guidelines for Evaluating Account and Services Requests. The payment account would be available to all institutions that are legally eligible for an account and could be beneficial for those focused primarily on payments innovations.\nThis payment account concept would be targeted to provide basic Federal Reserve payment services to legally eligible institutions that right now conduct payment services primarily through a third-party bank that has a full-fledged master account. There are many eligible firms engaged in substantial payments activities that may not want or need all the bells and whistles of a master account, or access to the full suite of Federal Reserve financial services, to successfully innovate and provide services to their customers. The idea is to tailor the services of these new accounts to the needs of these firms and the risks they present to the Federal Reserve Banks and the payment system. Accordingly, and importantly, these lower-risk payment accounts would have a streamlined timeline for review. Payments innovation moves fast, and the Federal Reserve needs to keep up.\nTo be more concrete, let me describe a possible prototype for this type of payment account or, as I sometimes call it, a \"skinny\" master account. The account would provide access to the Federal Reserve payment rails while controlling for various risks to the Federal Reserve and the payment system. To control the size of the accounts and associated impacts on the Fed's balance sheet, the Reserve Banks would not pay interest on balances in a payment account, and balance caps may be imposed. These accounts would not have daylight overdraft privileges\u00e2\u0080\u0094if the balance hits zero, payments will be rejected. They would not be eligible for discount window borrowing or have access to all Federal Reserve payment services for which the Reserve Banks cannot control the risk of daylight overdrafts. I want to be clear that this is just a prototype idea to provide some clarity on how things could change. The upshot is that, in my view, the payments landscape, as well as the types of providers, has evolved dramatically in recent years, and, accordingly, a new payments account could better reflect this new reality.\nAs Federal Reserve staff examine this idea, we will engage with all interested stakeholders to hear perspectives on the benefits and drawbacks to this approach. You will be hearing more about this shortly.\nLet me wrap up here so we can get to the really exciting part of this conference, which is about innovation and the future of payments. Thank you to the panelists who took the time to participate, those in the audience who agreed to be here, and the many others watching online. And a special thanks to Fed staff, who moved very fast to get this together quickly to fit into a very busy fall at the Fed. On with the conference!\n1.

This event brings together academics, regulators, and industry experts, encouraging broad collaboration and rigorous discussion.\nThis conference marks a critical and necessary evolution in the Federal Reserve's stress test program. Stress testing is an important supervisory tool that was initially designed to maintain financial stability and establish binding capital requirements for the largest banks. As the role of stress testing must evolve, we have shifted our focus to enhance the reliability and credibility of both the process and its outcomes. Going forward, the Federal Reserve is committed to transparency and ensuring that public input and stakeholder comment enhance the program over time.\nStress testing remains an important element of the Board's capital framework and supervisory program for large banks. To promote public accountability and achieve robust outcomes, the Board plans to solicit public comment on various stress testing reforms later this month. This proposal seeks to ensure that any substantive changes are informed by public input prior to their adoption.\nThese actions are part of a broader set of capital-related measures designed to right-size and recalibrate the regulatory framework to better balance safety and soundness with the role of the financial system in promoting economic growth. The Board intends to leverage public and industry perspectives to further improve the stress test.\nThe stress testing package will provide detailed model descriptions, including assumptions and limitations for each model, as well as the rationale behind key modeling choices. The proposal will invite public comment on the specific modeling changes that the Board plans to implement for the 2026 stress test, including proposed changes that address the sensitivity of pre-provision net revenue projections to recent bank performance, and to improve the design and related assumptions for certain models including credit losses, operational risk and securities.\nThe second aspect of the proposal seeks comment on scenario design for the stress test, particularly the guides governing the variables included in the severely adverse macroeconomic scenario. The proposal would also include details on the macroeconomic model used to formulate the paths of the variables that are not determined by a guide for a given annual scenario. In addition, the proposal would cover disclosure of the global market shock framework, including the logic behind shock severity, liquidity horizons and the description of the models generating these shocks.\nThird, the proposal would solicit public comment on the severely adverse scenario that the Board intends to use for the 2026 stress test.\nWhile I have attempted to provide a high-level summary of the proposal, it is not possible to capture the depth and breadth of the changes. We look forward to working with all of our stakeholders to improve our stress test and reduce the year-over-year volatility in the stress testing results.\nBefore I conclude, I would like to recognize the dedication and professionalism of our stress testing staff at both the Board and Reserve Banks. The pending comprehensive stress testing package reflects countless hours of diligent work, perseverance, and collaboration. This robust and thorough proposal would not have been possible without the extraordinary commitment of all involved. I am grateful for your contributions and would like to formally acknowledge your essential role in this important work.\nThank you to our attendees for your continued partnership and dedication to research and collaboration in stress testing. Your engagement helps us build a safer and more resilient financial system.\n1.

Waller\nAt the Council on Foreign Relations, New York, New York\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Tom, and thank you to the Council on Foreign Relations for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nSince the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) last meeting on September 16 and 17, economic data have tended to support my view of a labor market that is softening and inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094absent temporary tariff effects\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is running fairly close to the FOMC's 2 percent target. Based on what I know today, I support continued easing of monetary policy from its current setting, which I judge is moderately restricting aggregate demand and economic activity. But I also see a conflict right now between data showing solid growth in economic activity and data showing a softening labor market.\n2\nSo, something's gotta give\u00e2\u0080\u0094either economic growth softens to match a soft labor market, or the labor market rebounds to match stronger economic growth. Since we don't know which way the data will break on this conflict, we need to move with care when adjusting the policy rate to ensure we don't make a mistake that will be costly to correct. I believe that how that process plays out in the coming months will have a significant impact on the path of monetary policy.\nResolving this conflict has been complicated by the government shutdown, which has delayed important economic data that policymakers and the public rely on to judge economic conditions. Although private-sector data alternatives are available and a helpful complement to official statistics, they are less informative when they stand alone. The delay in the September employment report in particular makes it harder to know whether the labor market is continuing to soften or is stabilizing. The shutdown also delayed today's retail sales report for September, which would help show if household spending is continuing to support solid growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) or if there are signs of slower spending that forecasters have been expecting for some time. Yesterday's and today's releases on consumer and producer prices were also delayed, data that is important in judging the impact of higher import tariffs and progress toward the FOMC's price-stability goal. The Administration has recalled some Labor Department employees to complete and release the consumer price inflation report on October 24\u00e2\u0080\u0094in time to inform the FOMC's policy decision five days later.\nTo deal with this lack of public data, I spend a lot of my time talking to business contacts, whose views help me form my outlook for the economy. So far that input tends to support\u00e2\u0080\u0094rather than resolve\u00e2\u0080\u0094the contrast we have seen between strong economic activity and a softening labor market. Employers indicate to me that there was some further softening of the labor market last month, while retailers report continued solid spending, with a bit of caution from lower-income households.\nIn the balance of these remarks, I will examine other information we have on economic activity, inflation, and the labor market, and what this implies for monetary policy. While I feel confident, based on what I know today, that monetary policy should take another step toward a more neutral setting at the FOMC's next meeting, the path of appropriate policy beyond that point will be influenced by how the conflict between data on economic activity and the labor market is resolved and the expected path of inflation.\nWhile there are times when the data are consistent and paint a clear picture, the economy is vast and complex, and it is quite often the case that some of the data we look at will point in a different direction from other data and make that picture of the economy fuzzy. Almost every month, I need to use some judgment in sifting signal from noise in the economic data\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is just part of the job of economic forecasting and policymaking. Less often, but often enough, the conflicts in the data are consequential for the outlook. For example, recall that in the first half of 2022, the data were creating a puzzle: GDP was contracting while the economy created 2.7 million jobs.\n3\nThese conflicting data on the performance of the economy complicated the decision on how to set the policy rate. We are facing a similar problem today.\nI have been referring to the surprisingly strong data on economic activity, so let's start there. After real GDP expanded 2.8 percent last year, it slowed in the first half of this year. GDP\u00e2\u0080\u0094after smoothing through the modest contraction in the first quarter and robust growth of 3.8 percent in the second quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0094grew around 1.6 percent in the first half. This pattern of GDP growth is partially a result of consumption growth that showed a similar pattern. Slower growth in spending and GDP made sense based on the restrictive setting of monetary policy, but it was stronger than many expected with the imposition of sizable tariffs. And after not observing the effects of tariffs on household spending in the first half of the year, many thought it would show up in the third quarter. Yet, the data we have for the third quarter indicate that growth has accelerated. Looking across all the available data, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model is projecting another quarter of GDP growth close to 4 percent, while the Blue Chip consensus of private-sector forecasts has a prediction of 2.5 percent. Even if the published estimate is closer to 2.5 percent, that is still not consistent with a labor market that has barely created any jobs since May.\nOne sign that GDP may be expanding closer to the lower end of these estimates is that business conditions seemed a bit softer in September, based on surveys of purchasing managers. The manufacturing sector continued to contract slightly\u00e2\u0080\u0094as it has since March. Purchasing managers for the large majority of businesses that are outside manufacturing reported a slowdown from August to a level that is at the breakeven point between expansion and contraction.\nSomething that will affect the growth rate of GDP in the fourth quarter is the federal government shutdown. If it is resolved in the next couple of weeks without major changes in government staffing or funding, the shutdown will lower GDP growth several tenths of a percentage point in the fourth quarter and raise it the same amount in the first quarter of next year. But if the shutdown lasts considerably longer and does result in permanent staffing and spending cuts, then the drag in the fourth quarter could be larger and the bounceback smaller.\nLet me now turn to inflation. Twelve-month personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation rose in August to 2.7 percent, and core PCE inflation was up 2.9 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0094both above the FOMC's 2 percent target. Compared with an earlier era, when inflation ran close to 2 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0094from 2002 through 2007\u00e2\u0080\u0094core goods inflation is now running a half a percentage point higher, and research by Federal Reserve Board staff and others indicates that most of this is due to the effects of tariffs. Though a partial pass-through of tariffs will permanently raise the price level, tariffs will only temporarily affect the rate of inflation. The FOMC does not target the price level, but it does target 2 percent inflation over the longer run. Since I expect tariff effects on inflation to fade in the coming months, what matters for monetary policy is the rate of inflation outside of tariffs, and estimates by Federal Reserve staff indicate that this underlying rate of inflation is running fairly close to our target.\n4\nWith market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations apparently well anchored and a soft labor market keeping down wage demands, I judge that inflation is on a path to a sustained level of 2 percent and should not itself be a barrier to moving monetary policy toward a more neutral setting.\nGiven this benign view of inflation, I believe the ultimate disposition of the labor market will be the more salient factor affecting monetary policy. As I said, the broad message of all the labor market data is one of weakening in demand, relative to supply, even with substantially lower net immigration and a decline in labor force participation this year. Monthly job creation went from an average of 111,000 in the first quarter to 55,000 in the second, and the latest official report for August was 22,000. The numbers are nearly the same for the private sector, which I consider a better guide to the overall labor market. Furthermore, based on an estimate of the benchmark revision to the level of employment in March 2025 and extrapolating forward for the rest of this year, when the revisions are released next year it is likely that payroll employment has actually fallen, on net, since May. If the economy is growing as healthily as spending and GDP data indicate, I would expect that employment would recover in the coming months to a positive but not high level, reflecting the reduced labor supply that I just mentioned. However, if spending and GDP growth slow, and better reflect an economy that doesn't seem to be creating jobs, then the labor market may continue to soften.\nWith the absence of the September employment report, we must rely on other data for a sense of what happened last month. Alternative labor market data for September present a mixed picture of how things are evolving. Private-sector employment tracked by the payroll services firm ADP points to continued slowing in job creation. ADP estimates that private employment fell 32,000 in September after falling 3,000 in August. The company said that \"job creation continued to lose momentum across most sectors.\"\n5\nData on job postings on the online job search firm Indeed also point to a continued gradual reduction in employment but don't signal of a significant downturn in hiring.\nIndeed's openings data are useful in the absence of the September jobs report because, over time, they line up closely with another report for September that may be delayed: the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). The JOLTS data, available through August, have been echoing what I have been hearing consistently from my business contacts, which is that firms are holding on to workers but are not backfilling positions or planning to expand hiring. Total separations are quite low by historical standards, and both layoffs and the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs are low. At the same time, the hiring rate has continued to fall and, outside of the pandemic recession, is at its lowest level since 2012.\nThis situation may appear fairly stable, but I find this \"no hire, no fire\" stance by employers a bit ominous. It is possible that many employers who found it hard to find qualified workers during the pandemic are especially reluctant to let them go, even in the face of considerable uncertainty about demand and staffing levels in the future. But when workers do leave, they are not being replaced. Businesses have reported that hiring and expansion are \"on pause,\" but some of my business contacts say that they can't wait forever and will soon have to decide whether more or fewer employees are needed. Both business and consumer surveys conducted by the New York Fed signal an upturn in expectations about future levels of unemployment.\n6\nLooking further ahead, I can see two possible paths for the labor market.\nOn the one hand, we could see a stabilization of the labor market\u00e2\u0080\u0094in essence, it could move toward the story that consumption and GDP seem to be telling. Despite more than three years of restrictive monetary policy, spending has proved very resilient. Most forecasts called for a significant step-down in the pace of PCE growth this year, but that sizable slowdown hasn't happened. One factor that may help explain this is that the savings rate has been revised notably upward, resulting in higher disposable personal income and more support for spending. It is possible that resilient spending will help convince businesses to maintain staffing and even expand in the coming months, bringing about a recovery in job creation. Another possibility is that r*\u00e2\u0080\u0094the interest rate below which monetary policy stimulates demand\u00e2\u0080\u0094is higher than most forecasters believe. If this were true, then the current setting of monetary policy may not be holding back demand and economic activity very much, which would have implications for how quickly the FOMC should lower the policy rate.\nThose are some reasons why the labor market may strengthen and validate the story being told, based on what we know so far, about economic activity in the third quarter. On the other hand, there are some reasons why the labor market could continue to soften while GDP growth steps down to a more moderate pace. For me, one of them is how dependent consumption is on a relatively small number of higher-income consumers. The highest-earning 10 percent of households are responsible for 22 percent of personal consumption. The top 20 percent of households spend 35 percent of the total. Their share of stock market wealth is even more skewed, and lots of research shows that these consumers are fairly unaffected by higher prices, higher unemployment, or a slower economy. The bottom 60 percent of earners represent 45 percent of consumption and hold only 15 percent of wealth. Their spending decisions are much more likely to be affected by prices, financing conditions, and job availability. I have heard from business contacts that this group has been affected by higher prices this year and is already changing its spending plans to find better value.\nThat view was echoed in the Federal Reserve's recently released Beige Book, which is a survey of business contacts.\n7\nThe consensus view across the country is that while consumer spending inched down in recent weeks, spending by higher-income households on luxury travel and accommodation was strong; lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. At what point do higher prices prompt a larger cutback in spending by middle- and lower-income people?\nAnother reason for a greater weakening of the labor market is that artificial intelligence (AI) may reduce demand for workers. Over the past few months, retailers have told me that they will reduce employment next year because of the efficiency gains from AI. Firms are saying that they can and will replace workers in call centers and IT support with AI robots. This echoes what I read recently about the largest private employer in the United States: Walmart. Walmart says that despite expectations of solid sales growth, it plans to hold net employment steady for the next three years as AI r",

Barr\nAt 2025 D.C. Fintech Week, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\nPayments innovation is accelerating.\n1\nStablecoins, artificial intelligence (AI), real-time payments, and richer payment metadata offer significant improvements to the cost, speed, and functionality of payments. Better payments functionality can help financial institutions and businesses manage liquidity more efficiently at lower cost. It can also mean that people receive their paychecks more promptly and manage their payments more effectively. Payments innovation is especially important for lower-income individuals who are often underserved by the financial system and lack financial slack.\nFor the bulk of my remarks today, I will focus on the benefits and risks of stablecoins. Congress has recently passed legislation that provides some clarity to issuers of stablecoins about how they can fit into the regulatory and supervisory framework. While there is a lot of work to do on the part of the government to fill in the specifics during the rule-writing process, increased certainty could lead to more rapid development of stablecoins and related products and services for businesses and households.\nPotential Benefits of Stablecoins\nI will start with some of the potential benefits of stablecoins. The primary benefit comes from the ledger itself, which can operate globally and encode functionality and conditionality directly into assets and transactions. This functionality unlocks a range of new financial use cases that were previously impractical when transactions required updating a series of ledgers spread across individual financial institutions.\nThe global nature of stablecoins is fundamental to their usefulness in parts of the payment system that have high friction, such as cross-border payments. Some of these frictions are necessary and important, such as those associated with complying with relevant laws and regulations on money laundering and terrorist financing. But removing or mitigating other frictions may reduce costs and facilitate more efficient transactions.\nWhile today stablecoins are mostly used to facilitate crypto-trading activities, and secondarily as a dollar-denominated store of value in some foreign jurisdictions, I want to provide some examples where stablecoins may be useful for additional functions in cross-border payments.\nRemittances\nStablecoins can be used to reduce the costs of remittances, since it tends to be more expensive to send remittances to jurisdictions with less-developed domestic payment systems.\n2\nAs of a few years ago, stablecoins had only a limited ability to reduce costs because there were meaningful fees associated with on-ramping into stablecoins and off-ramping out to local currencies. However, stablecoin acceptance networks have arisen in some corridors that help reduce these fees and offer the potential to reduce the cost and increase the speed of remittances for those least able to bear these costs.\nTrade finance\nStablecoins have the potential to also improve the speed of managing the paperwork and processes inherent in global trade and trade finance, perhaps with the use of smart contracts. In these applications, a digitally native form of payment could potentially be used to streamline the tracking and validation process that occurs between financial institutions, shipping companies, and customs warehouses and the companies that engage in trade. Small businesses might see lower costs and greater access.\nMultinational firms' cash management\nAnd for larger firms that have entities across the globe, stablecoins may help with treasury management. Stablecoins offer the promise of near-real-time global payments, helping multinational firms manage their cash efficiently between their related entities while still making payments through local internal entities in different countries, reducing costs and improving liquidity.\nRisks to Achieving the Benefits of New Payment Technologies\nI have mentioned just a few of the potential ways in which stablecoins can provide benefits to households and business. Continued investment in technology can also support compliance with important legal restrictions that prevent the use of the financial system for nefarious purposes. This investment will be a key area necessary for supporting stablecoins in achieving their potential benefits. Let me start with money laundering and terrorist financing.\nThe potential for technology to support anti-money-laundering compliance\nOne unique feature of stablecoins is their role as bearer instruments, similar to old-fashioned traveler's checks, but mostly operating on global permissionless networks that can include plenty of users with bad intentions. That creates particular challenges for preventing money laundering and terrorist finance, since bad actors can purchase stablecoins in secondary markets that may not have customer identification requirements. The U.S. puts a heavy premium on ensuring that all financial institutions comply with rules that seek to prevent criminals and terrorists from using our financial system. Financial companies, particularly banks, that take shortcuts on anti-money-laundering compliance sooner or later come to regret these shortcuts.\nCompliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money-laundering requirements can be very data intensive and costly, requiring significant staffing to identify and then address or resolve flagged issues. Permissioned networks with only trusted nodes doing the know your customer work can reduce the risks. Moreover, new technologies, used with care, can potentially reduce frictions on legitimate payments and speed up the identification of problem payments. AI may be well suited to flag payments that are outliers relative to typical patterns, potentially reducing the volume of false positives and unnecessary filings.\n3\nThere may also be ways to improve the explainability of payments if they travel through the payment cycle with more data elements, such as those in the ISO 20022 standards recently implemented on Fedwire. There are also technologies that can aid with stablecoin compliance, such as trusted identity tokens in wallets that satisfy Customer Identification Program requirements and smart contracts that freeze stablecoins in problematic wallets. This suite of tools can also be used for preventing other types of crime, such as fraud.\nA Rocky History of Private Money Creation\nA second key area is financial stability. Let me take a step back and explain why I am focused on the financial stability risk of stablecoins. Caution is warranted because of the long and painful history of private money created with insufficient safeguards.\nThe fragility of private money is inherent in the way that it is created. Financial institutions issue liquid liabilities to the public that are redeemable on demand and at par, but issuers risk being ultimately unable to liquidate their assets promptly at par when facing run dynamics and market stress. Maturity and liquidity transformation can have social benefits by meeting the needs of the public for money-like assets and supporting the supply of credit to the real economy. However, for this social benefit to be durable, maturity transformation necessarily requires safeguards that address run risk.\n4\nLooking at the long history of runs from private money is a helpful reminder of how these runs can happen and what's at stake when they do. For example, in the 1800s, during the so-called Free Banking Era, the United States had competing forms of private money in the form of bank notes. The value of these notes was tied to the creditworthiness, location, and credibility of the issuing bank, although some of the notes were backed by bonds issued by the state governments as well as other high-quality assets.\n5\nDespite these protections, the quality of the guarantees backing the bank notes was not beyond question, and they often traded below par. Concerns about the health of issuing banks, or of the states themselves in this era, resulted in regular bank runs and, in a number of instances, widespread financial panics. This stability of the system was improved over time, such as through legal changes that effectively required bank notes to be backed only by U.S. government securities. Nevertheless, regular episodes of runs continued to materialize until the Panic of 1907, which prominently featured a run on trust companies that offered deposit products backed by assets less liquid than the assets held by banks of the era. This episode led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System.\nThe historical examples point out that issuing liquid liabilities redeemable at par but backed by assets, even high-quality ones, about which creditors might have questions makes private money vulnerable to run risk. These same dynamics occurred even in much more modern times. The most notable example is when the Reserve Primary Fund broke the buck on September 16, 2008, one day after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, as the assets backing the fund came into question.\n6\nPressures on money market funds also occurred during the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, when institutional prime funds suffered outflows of about 30 percent of their assets under management within a period of two weeks.\n7\nThese experiences show the vulnerability of private money-like assets to runs, and how these runs can threaten not only the financial sector, but also the broader economy.\nIssues in the Unregulated Stablecoin Market\nThe mostly unregulated stablecoin market has also experienced run dynamics in recent times. While people purchasing something called a \"stablecoin\" might reasonably assume that they can rely on redemption at par on demand, unregulated stablecoins are currently backed by a range of non\u00e2\u0080\u0093cash reserve assets that can make them vulnerable, especially under stressed conditions.\n8\nThree key features\u00e2\u0080\u0094redemption on demand, at par, and backed by noncash assets\u00e2\u0080\u0094render stablecoins susceptible to runs similar to fragile banks or money market funds.\n9\nBecause stablecoins are not backed by deposit insurance and stablecoin issuers do not have access to central bank liquidity, the quality and liquidity of their reserve assets is critical to their long-run viability. At the same time, stablecoin issuers traditionally retain profits from investing reserve assets and therefore have a high incentive to maximize the return on their reserve assets by extending the risk spectrum as far out as possible. Stretching the boundaries of permissible reserve assets can increase profits in good times but risks a crack in confidence during inevitable bouts of market stress. The incentive to reach for yield can grow especially in lower-interest-rate environments. Stablecoins will only be stable if they can be reliably and promptly redeemed at par in a range of conditions, including during stress in the market that can put pressure on the value of even otherwise liquid government debt, and during episodes of strain on the individual issuer or its related entities.\nPermissible Stablecoin Reserves under the New Legal Framework\nTo address these vulnerabilities in the largely unregulated stablecoin market, Congress passed the bipartisan GENIUS Act. The act's primary tool to mitigate the risk of runs is limiting permissible reserve assets to an itemized list of highly liquid assets.\n10\nThis is a significant improvement in an area where reserve assets for stablecoins have been highly varied. Tight control over reserve assets, coupled with supervision, capital and liquidity requirements, and other measures, could enhance the stability of stablecoins and make them a more viable payment instruments over the long term.\nBut success in accomplishing these goals will depend on the details of regulatory implementation. The GENIUS Act provides a helpful statutory framework, but it will be up to both the federal banking agencies and the states to coordinate and develop a comprehensive set of rules that can fill in important gaps and ensure that there are robust guardrails to protect users of stablecoins and mitigate broader risks to the financial system. Regulators have a lot of work to do to implement the act, and I will outline several areas that will require close attention.\nFor example, some of the enumerated reserve assets backing stablecoins are not immune to stress. Permissible reserve assets include uninsured deposits, which were a key risk factor during the March 2023 banking stress.\n11\nWhile the GENIUS Act permits regulators to limit the concentration of reserve assets in uninsured deposits, it will matter how these rules are written.\n12\nAdditionally, in connection with overnight repo, the act permits any medium of exchange authorized or adopted by a foreign government to be held as a reserve asset\u00e2\u0080\u0094a category that could include potentially volatile assets.\n13\nFor example, until quite recently, El Salvador treated Bitcoin as legal tender, and it still specifically permits Bitcoin to be used for transactions on a voluntary basis. As a result, an issuer could argue that Bitcoin repo could qualify as an eligible reserve asset for a stablecoin. In a case of stress experienced by the issuer or counterparty, or if Bitcoin were to drop sharply in value, a stablecoin issuer could be stuck holding the Bitcoin that had declined in value, potentially compromising the one-to-one backing of the stablecoin liabilities. To the extent possible, regulations should be put in place to eliminate or minimize such risks.\n14\nIn addition to the potential vulnerabilities of some permitted reserves, other aspects of the GENIUS Act might permit risks to develop unless carefully regulated. The act permits four federal agencies and agencies in each state and territory to serve as the primary regulator and supervisor of stablecoin issuers.\n15\nAs a result, there might be a great deal of heterogeneity in the regulatory frameworks that apply to permitted issuers, despite controls in the act intended to provide that the frameworks are substantially similar. The resulting array of charter choice options, unless carefully managed, may provide incentives for regulatory arbitrage.\nFor example, the act permits federal and state regulators to authorize stablecoin issuers to engage in a broad range of \"digital asset service provider\" and \"incidental\" activities other than stablecoin issuance, including potentially acting as a crypto-asset exchange or broker-dealer.\n16\nIssuers are likely to seek to stretch these activities limitations. In fact, issuers may argue that they are permitted under the act to perform the full range of activit",

Waller\nAt DC Fintech Week, Arlington, Virginia\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today about artificial intelligence (AI).\n1\nAI is a powerful and rapidly advancing technology that has captured everyone's attention. If you've watched enough sci-fi, you know that major technological change is usually either dystopian or utopian\u00e2\u0080\u0094the robots either take over the world or improve it. These polarized views are also common among economists and technologists. On one side, there are the doomers\u00e2\u0080\u0094those convinced that new technologies will destroy jobs, widen inequality, and concentrate power. On the other, there are the techno-optimists\u00e2\u0080\u0094those convinced we're on the brink of an unprecedented leap in productivity, growth, and creativity if we let the technology proliferate. As usual, the truth about AI is probably somewhere in between. The job of an economic policymaker is to separate hype and hyperbole from hard data and sound analysis and understand what AI really means for growth, productivity, and the broader economy.\nI will focus on three aspects of major technological change that \"repeat\" through history. First, technological change is a constant in our lives, and it is almost always disruptive. It upends the way we work and socialize. Second, it alters existing power relationships in unsettling ways. Finally, technological change reliably raises productivity and our standard of living while improving the quality of our lives. My intent is to describe how AI is likely to affect our lives along these lines and how it differs from past technological changes.\nWe have always had technological changes that dramatically transform the economy and our daily lives. In the 1880s, electricity was a curiosity reserved for a few wealthy urban people and some limited industrial uses. By 1920, half of homes had electricity, by 1940 nearly half had a refrigerator, and by 1945, 85 percent of homes were electrified. Automobile use also rose swiftly. Auto registrations rose from 140,000 in 1906 to 23 million in 1929, at a time when the total number of households was fewer than 30 million. These advances changed daily life in profound ways. Another aspect of technological change is the speed at which new technologies are being adopted. In the last 50 years, we've experienced adoption of new technologies twice as fast: Personal computers were widespread within 20 years\u00e2\u0080\u0094the internet in 12 years\u00e2\u0080\u0094and it only took 6 years for smartphones to be universal. And now AI is moving even more rapidly. I tend to believe that the transition for workers affected by AI will be accelerated also, but no one really knows. Such predictions are certainly beyond my powers as an economic policymaker, so I will limit myself to the here and now. The point of this discussion is that technological change is a constant in our lives\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is always happening and will continue to happen\u00e2\u0080\u0094and AI seems to be following the pattern of ever-faster adoption and change.\nAlthough it is a constant in our lives, technology also disrupts our lives every time a new innovation appears. The way that we work and produce changes. Jobs disappear, and new ones appear. Our social lives are disrupted as well, often in good ways\u00e2\u0080\u0094but sometimes not so good. We used to write letters and mail them to communicate with loved ones. This took time and was expensive. Now we text or use FaceTime or Zoom to communicate with friends and family members anytime. This makes it easier to maintain relationships across geography and time. But it can also undermine those social connections. When I walk into a party and see half of the people there staring at their screens, I can see that technology can lead to less social interaction, not more. Technological disruption, like anything else, has benefits and costs. But, as I will argue later, I believe that we need to let this disruption occur to recognize the benefits alongside the costs, to enable us to lead better lives.\nMy second point was that technological innovation can alter power relationships in profound ways. When Gutenberg invented the printing press, he took away the Catholic Church's power over the written word and democratized it. When personal computers appeared, power shifted from those who managed mainframes to individual users. When the internet arrived, the control of news, information, and opinion pieces shifted from major news outlets to anyone with a webpage. AI will do the same. It will take power from \"experts\" and shift it to \"nonexperts.\" Much like Gutenberg's printing press, AI will likely democratize expertise. Tools that once required specialized training are already becoming accessible to a much wider range of people. We see this happening with software coding already. A nurse using an AI diagnostic tool or a technician relying on a generative model to troubleshoot complex equipment can perform higher-order tasks more efficiently. It will likely do the same for scientific discovery. Those who collected economic rents, or excess payments, from the control of power will lose those rents. But this will improve our lives in the process.\nWhenever a new technology emerges, the first question economists get is about jobs: Will this replace people or make them more productive? The challenge is that, with innovation, there is often a time inconsistency between the costs and the benefits. The disruptions come first; the benefits take time. When a new technology appears, it's always easier to see the jobs that are likely to disappear, but it's much harder to see the ones that will be created. When automobiles came on the scene, it was easy to see that saddlemakers' jobs would disappear. But it wasn't obvious that the saddlemaker's skills could be used to make car seats and that higher-productivity auto production would create many more and much higher paying jobs. Ten years ago, if I had said something called TikTok would arrive soon, no one would likely have been able to imagine that, or that social media would create what is now an established occupation\u00e2\u0080\u0094influencer.\nThe pattern appears to be repeating\u00e2\u0080\u0094only faster. A recent study by Stanford economists found that employment has fallen about 13 percent in occupations most exposed to AI, relative to those less affected.\n2\nThose contractions have appeared mainly in support and administrative roles\u00e2\u0080\u0094fields that tend to be automated first. This early effect from AI is consistent with what I have been hearing from business contacts. Retailers in particular are cutting back on employment for call centers and IT-related occupations. So far, most say this is being handled through attrition, but a number of retailers say that there is the potential for downsizing next year. That is also a message from a New York Fed survey that finds very few businesses are reporting AI-induced layoffs; they are instead using the technology to retrain employees.\n3\nThat said, AI is influencing recruiting for these firms, with some scaling back hiring because of AI and others adding workers who are proficient in its use. Looking ahead, however, layoffs and reductions in hiring plans due to AI use are expected to increase, especially for workers with a college degree.\nReturning to my final point, history has shown us that technology improves productivity and our standard of living. We initially always talk about how it will be a substitute for labor. This was the basic premise behind Marx's theory of capitalism\u00e2\u0080\u0094machines would replace humans in production, which would raise unemployment so high that social revolution would occur, leading to the end of capitalism and the rise of a socialist utopia. Yet this theory makes the fundamental mistake of failing to see that capital and labor are complements, not substitutes. More machines mean a firm can produce more output, but that also requires more labor as well. This is obvious just looking at economic data. The U.S. capital stock, measured in constant prices, is seven times larger than it was in 1950. Yet the unemployment rate in September 1950 was 4.4 percent, and it is 4.3 percent as of August 2025. This is why economists are typically techno-optimists\u00e2\u0080\u0094history has repeatedly shown that adopting new technologies leads to economic growth and greater employment, not less. Technological disruption is one form of a concept that economists have studied since Joseph Schumpeter named it in 1942: creative destruction. This topic has never been more relevant, and I note that just last week a share of the Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to two economists who explored how productivity-enhancing disruption raises living standards.\n4\nThere will surely be losers and winners from AI, but aside from questions about how AI's gains will be distributed, there is the more fundamental matter of how they will be measured, even at a macro level. Firms are using AI to increase productivity, which allows for greater output based on the same level of inputs. This gain is counted in gross domestic product (GDP) and its corollary, gross national income.\nIn America, one common feature of great technological innovations has been an onslaught of competition that has rapidly driven down costs and resulted in rapid and widespread adoption. If hardware and software innovation continue to drive down the cost of AI, then I see few barriers to its ongoing proliferation throughout the economy. That prospect, clearly, is driving the surge of AI investment we have seen. Will it continue? That will depend, in part, on whether AI delivers on the productivity increases that some believe it will bring.\nLabor productivity measures output per hour of work. The data is volatile, but average growth over the past few years is slower than over the past decade or several decades. A crucial question is whether AI will contribute to a resurgence in productivity growth. Any sustained productivity growth above 2 percent will tend to support rising real incomes and living standards without inflation pressure. As a monetary policymaker, I'm hoping that AI delivers.\nWhile we often focus on how technology enhances market activity and productivity, it also enhances the value of non-market-based activities. For example, Google Maps allows me to navigate foreign cities easier and faster when I am sightseeing. While this value is a not market-based activity and does not show up in GDP, it clearly makes my life better. Agentic AI has the potential to save me lots of leisure time that would have otherwise been spent planning vacations, paying bills, or making medical appointments. This increase in my well-being is not directly measured in GDP. But if these time-saving AI activities free me up to do more market-based production, then GDP will increase. I have no doubt that AI will boost GDP and national income, but many of its benefits may be in improving our nonmarket activities.\nEvery technology that changes how we live and work brings both promise and risk. AI is no exception. Fraud, disinformation, bias, and cybersecurity threats are already emerging. Any tool powerful enough to improve lives can also be misused. The task for policymakers is to manage those risks without slowing the innovation that drives growth. History shows that adaptation, not avoidance, is what sustains progress. Each wave of technology has disrupted industries and employment, but over time it has also lifted productivity, raised real incomes, and improved living standards.\nWe see different approaches to managing the disruption that occurs with technological change. Europe has often chosen to regulate first\u00e2\u0080\u0094to contain potential harms before the technology fully develops. The United States is taking a different path, leaning on its tradition of experimentation and market dynamism. That openness has long been a competitive advantage. It allowed the United States to lead in earlier waves of technology\u00e2\u0080\u0094from the internet to advanced computing\u00e2\u0080\u0094and it can do the same with AI. Over time, that willingness to experiment has translated into faster productivity growth and stronger economic performance than many of our peers, including Europe.\nThirty years ago, the United States embraced a new and disruptive technology\u00e2\u0080\u0094the World Wide Web. Europe was more cautious, weighed down by regulations and legacy industries that sought to control this innovation. The result, of course, is that America led a global technological revolution that disrupted media and other industries but also delivered jobs and broadly shared prosperity that handily outpaced the European Union over those thirty years. Perhaps the most important legacy of the American-led innovation of networked communications and computing was the culture of entrepreneurship and innovation it fostered, one that, in fact, has greatly contributed to America's leadership in AI. The American tradition is to invent and make use of technology, not shrink from it. Where there are risks, we take reasonable steps to mitigate them, rather than seek to avoid them altogether. Risk-taking is at the heart of our market economy; it fuels innovation, and we must preserve it.\nMuch like the leaders in this audience, the Federal Reserve is also learning by doing. I have championed a System-wide approach to continually educate our teams and enable experimentation with the latest wave of innovations\u00e2\u0080\u0094from large language models and agentic AI to applications in coding and payments. That's why, on October 21, I'm convening industry leaders to discuss AI in Payments as part of our Payments Innovation Conference. These engagements, combined with our own hands-on technical research, allow us to apply these technologies within the Fed and to support innovation across the private sector.\nTo conclude, AI is moving faster than previous waves of innovation. That velocity means both the disruptions and the benefits will arrive sooner. The challenge is to keep pace\u00e2\u0080\u0094to help workers and firms adjust so the gains in efficiency translate into higher real wages and sustained growth across the economy. For policymakers, we must let the disruption occur and trust that the long-run benefits will exceed any short-run costs.\nThank you.\n1.

Powell\nAt the 67th Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nShare\nThank you, Emily. And thank you to the National Association for Business Economics for the Adam Smith Award. It is an honor just to be mentioned alongside past recipients, including my predecessors Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke. Thank you for this recognition and for the opportunity to speak with you today.\nMonetary policy is more effective when the public understands what the Federal Reserve does and why. With that in mind, I hope to enhance understanding of one of the more arcane and technical aspects of monetary policy: the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. A colleague recently compared this topic to a trip to the dentist, but that comparison may be unfair\u00e2\u0080\u0094to dentists.\n1\nToday, I will discuss the essential role our balance sheet played during the pandemic, along with some lessons learned. I will then review our ample reserves implementation framework and the progress we have made toward normalizing the size of our balance sheet. I will conclude with some brief remarks on the economic outlook.\nBackground on the Fed's Balance Sheet\nOne of the primary purposes of a central bank is to provide the monetary foundation for the financial system and the broader economy. This foundation is made of central bank liabilities. On the Fed's balance sheet, the liability side of the ledger totaled $6.5 trillion as of October 8, and three categories account for roughly 95 percent of that total.\n2\nFirst, Federal Reserve notes\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, physical currency\u00e2\u0080\u0094totaled $2.4 trillion. Second, reserves\u00e2\u0080\u0094funds held by depository institutions at the Federal Reserve Banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094totaled $3.0 trillion. These deposits allow commercial banks to make and receive payments and meet regulatory requirements. Reserves are the safest and most liquid asset in the financial system, and only the Fed can create them. The adequate provision of reserves is essential to the safety and soundness of our banking system, the resilience and efficiency of our payments system, and ultimately the stability of our economy.\nThird is the Treasury General Account (TGA), currently at about $800 billion, which essentially is the checking account for the federal government. When the Treasury makes or receives payments, those flows affect dollar-for-dollar the supply of reserves or other liabilities in the system.\n3\nThe asset side of our ledger consists almost entirely of securities, including $4.2 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities and $2.1 trillion of government-guaranteed agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS).\n4\nWhen we add reserves to the system, we generally do so by purchasing Treasury securities in the open market and crediting the reserve accounts of the banks involved in the transaction with the seller. This process effectively transforms securities held by the public into reserves but does not change the total amount of government liabilities held by the public.\n5\nThe Balance Sheet Is an Important Tool\nThe Fed's balance sheet serves as a critical policy tool, especially when the policy rate is constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB). When COVID-19 struck in March 2020, the economy came to a near standstill and financial markets seized up, threatening to transform a public health crisis into a severe, prolonged economic downturn.\nIn response, we established a number of emergency liquidity facilities. Those programs, supported by Congress and the Administration, provided critical support to markets and were remarkably effective in restoring confidence and stability. At their peak in July 2020, loans from these facilities totaled just over $200 billion. Most of these loans were quickly unwound as conditions stabilized.\n6\nAt the same time, the market for U.S. Treasury securities\u00e2\u0080\u0094normally the deepest, most liquid market in the world and the bedrock of the global financial system\u00e2\u0080\u0094was under extraordinary pressure and on the verge of collapse. We used large-scale purchases of securities to restore functionality to the Treasury market. Faced with unprecedented market dysfunction, the Fed purchased Treasury and agency securities at an extraordinary pace in March and April of 2020. These purchases supported the flow of credit to households and businesses and fostered more accommodative financial conditions to support the recovery of the economy when it ultimately came.\n7\nThis source of policy accommodation was important as we had lowered the federal funds rate close to zero and expected it to remain there for some time.\nBy June 2020, we slowed our purchase pace to a still substantial $120 billion per month. In December 2020, as the economic outlook remained highly uncertain, the FOMC said that we expected to maintain that pace of purchases \"until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.\"\n8\nThat guidance provided assurance that the Fed would not prematurely withdraw support while the economic recovery remained fragile amid unprecedented conditions.\nWe maintained that pace of asset purchases through October 2021. By then, it had become apparent that elevated inflation was not likely to go away without a strong monetary response. At our meeting in November 2021, we announced a phaseout of asset purchases. At our next meeting in December, we doubled the pace of the taper and said that asset purchases would conclude by mid-March of 2022. Over the entire period of purchases, our securities holdings increased by $4.6 trillion.\nA number of observers have raised questions, fairly enough, about the size and composition of asset purchases during the pandemic recovery.\n9\nThroughout 2020 and 2021, the economy continued to face significant challenges as successive waves of COVID caused widespread disruption and loss. During that tumultuous period, we continued purchases in order to avoid a sharp, unwelcome tightening of financial conditions at a time when the economy still appeared to be highly vulnerable. Our thinking was informed by recent episodes in which signals about reducing the balance sheet had triggered significant tightening in financial conditions. We were thinking of events of December 2018, as well as the 2013 \"taper tantrum.\"\n10\nRegarding the composition of our purchases, some have questioned the inclusion of agency MBS purchases given the strong housing market during the pandemic recovery.\n11\nOutside of purchases aimed specifically at market functioning, MBS purchases are primarily intended, like our purchases of Treasury securities, to ease broader financial conditions when the policy rate is constrained at the ELB.\n12\nThe extent to which these MBS purchases disproportionately affected housing market conditions during this period is challenging to determine. Many factors affect the mortgage market, and many factors beyond the mortgage market affect supply and demand in the broader housing market.\n13\nWith the clarity of hindsight, we could have\u00e2\u0080\u0094and perhaps should have\u00e2\u0080\u0094stopped asset purchases sooner. Our real-time decisions were intended to serve as insurance against downside risks. We knew that we could unwind purchases relatively quickly once we ended them, which is exactly what we did. Research and experience tell us that asset purchases affect the economy through expectations regarding the future size and duration of our balance sheet.\n14\nWhen we announced our taper, market participants began pricing in its effects, pulling forward the tightening in financial conditions.\n15\nStopping sooner could have made some difference, but not likely enough to fundamentally alter the trajectory of the economy. Nonetheless, our experience since 2020 does suggest that we can be more nimble in our use of the balance sheet, and more confident that our communications will foster appropriate expectations among market participants given their growing experience with these tools.\nSome have also argued that we could have better explained the purpose of asset purchases in real time.\n16\nThere is always room for improved communication. But I believe our statements were reasonably clear about our objectives, which were to support and then sustain smooth market functioning and to help foster accommodative financial conditions. Over time, the relative importance of those objectives evolved with economic conditions. But the objectives were never in conflict, so at the time this issue appeared to be a distinction without much of a difference. That is not always the case, of course. For example, the March 2023 banking stress led to a sizable increase in our balance sheet through lending operations. We clearly differentiated these financial stability operations from our monetary policy stance. Indeed, we continued to raise the policy rate through that time.\nOur Ample Reserves Framework Works Well\nTurning to my second topic, our ample reserves regime has proven highly effective, delivering good control of our policy rate across a wide range of challenging economic conditions, while promoting financial stability and supporting a resilient payments system.\n17\nIn this framework, an ample supply of reserves ensures adequate liquidity in the banking system, and control of our policy rate is achieved through the setting of our administered rates\u00e2\u0080\u0094interest on reserve balances and the overnight reverse repo rate. This approach allows us to maintain rate control independently of the size of our balance sheet. That is important given large, unpredictable swings in liquidity demand from the private sector and significant fluctuations in autonomous factors affecting reserve supply, such as the Treasury General Account.\nThis framework has proven resilient whether the balance sheet is shrinking or growing. Since June 2022, we have reduced the size of our balance sheet by $2.2 trillion\u00e2\u0080\u0094from 35 percent to just under 22 percent of GDP\u00e2\u0080\u0094while maintaining effective interest rate control.\n18\nOur long-stated plan is to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions.\n19\nWe may approach that point in coming months, and we are closely monitoring a wide range of indicators to inform this decision.\n20\nSome signs have begun to emerge that liquidity conditions are gradually tightening, including a general firming of repo rates along with more noticeable but temporary pressures on selected dates. The Committee's plans lay out a deliberately cautious approach to avoid the kind of money market strains experienced in September 2019. Moreover, the tools of our implementation framework, including the standing repo facility and the discount window, will help contain funding pressures and keep the federal funds rate within our target range through this transition to lower reserve levels.\nNormalizing the size of our balance sheet does not mean going back to the balance sheet we had before the pandemic. In the longer run, the size of our balance sheet is determined by the public's demand for our liabilities rather than our pandemic-related asset purchases. Non-reserve liabilities currently stand about $1.1 trillion higher than just prior to the pandemic, thus requiring that our securities holdings be equally higher. Demand for reserves has risen as well, in part reflecting the growth of the banking system and the overall economy.\nRegarding the composition of our securities portfolio, relative to the outstanding universe of Treasury securities, our portfolio is currently overweight longer-term securities and underweight shorter-term securities. The longer-run composition will be a topic of Committee discussion. Transition to our desired composition will occur gradually and predictably, giving market participants time to adjust and minimizing the risk of market disruption. Consistent with our longstanding guidance, we aim for a portfolio consisting primarily of Treasury securities over the longer run.\n21\nSome have questioned whether the interest we pay on reserves is costly to taxpayers. In fact, that is not the case. The Fed earns interest income from the Treasury securities that back reserves. Most of the time, our interest earnings from Treasury holdings more than cover the interest paid on reserves, generating significant remittances to the Treasury. By law, we remit all profits to the Treasury after covering expenses. Since 2008, even after accounting for the recent period of negative net income, our total remittances to Treasury have totaled more than $900 billion. While our net interest income has temporarily been negative due to the rapid rise in policy rates to control inflation, this is highly unusual. Our net income will soon turn positive again, as it typically has been throughout our history. Of course, having negative net income has no bearing on our ability to conduct monetary policy or meet our financial obligations.\n22\nIf our ability to pay interest on reserves and other liabilities were eliminated, the Fed would lose control over rates. The stance of monetary policy would no longer be appropriately calibrated to economic conditions and would push the economy away from our employment and price stability goals. To restore rate control, large sales of securities over a short period of time would be needed to shrink our balance sheet and the quantity of reserves in the system. The volume and speed of these sales could strain Treasury market functioning and compromise financial stability. Market participants would need to absorb the sales of Treasury securities and agency MBS, which would put upward pressure on the entire yield curve, raising borrowing costs for the Treasury and the private sector. Even after that volatile and disruptive process, the banking system would be less resilient and more vulnerable to liquidity shocks.\nThe bottom line is that our ample reserves regime has proven remarkably effective for implementing monetary policy and supporting economic and financial stability.\nCurrent Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy Outlook\nI will close with a brief discussion of the economy and the outlook for monetary policy. Although some important government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, we routinely review a wide variety of public- and private-sector data that have remained available. We also maintain a nationwide network of contacts through the Reserve Banks who provide valuable insights, which will be summarized in tomorrow's Beige Book.\nBased on the data that we do have, it is fair to say that the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting four weeks ago. Data available prior to the shutdown, however, show that growth in economic activity",

Bowman\nAt the Community Bank Conference, hosted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nAccessible Keys for Video\n[Space Bar]\ntoggles play/pause;\n[Right/Left Arrows]\nseeks the video forwards and back (5 sec );\n[Up/Down Arrows]\nincrease/decrease volume;\n[M]\ntoggles mute on/off;\n[F]\ntoggles fullscreen on/off (Except IE 11);\nThe\n[Tab]\nkey may be used in combination with the\n[Enter/Return]\nkey to navigate and activate control buttons, such as caption on/off.\nAs we wrap up today's conference, I would like to thank all of the moderators and presenters on today's panels. And of course, Secretary Bessent for sharing his perspectives on community banks, and the many community bankers, and state bank regulators and others who attended today's event in person or virtually. I would also like to recognize our staff whose hard work made today's conference possible.\nCommunity banks drive local and regional economic growth, and they play a central role in the financial health of the customers and communities they serve.\n1\nThese banks often pursue unique business models\u00e2\u0080\u0094ones that are not easily replicated by larger banks, including the relationship banking model that is a central tenet of community banking. In today's environment, many community banks are embracing innovation and continuing to evolve to better serve their customers in the current and future financial system. The focus of today's conference has been on community banks, how they continue to innovate, and how they rise to the challenge to support their customers as the financial landscape continues to change.\nLegislators and regulators are also rising to the challenge to ensure that the community banking system continues to thrive, through the critical task of ensuring that supervision and regulation are appropriately tailored. Our support for community banks cannot just be lip service; it must translate into specific actions that right-size regulation and apply appropriate supervisory standards, specifically in identifying the appropriate definition of a community bank, in establishing appropriately tailored regulatory thresholds, and in approaching supervision focused on material financial risk.\nSo, what is a community bank for this purpose? Generally, the regulatory framework uses the blunt tool of fixed asset thresholds. We know that relying solely on fixed asset thresholds is imperfect, at best. They fail to account for economic growth and inflation over time, resulting in firms with stable growth, consistent business models, and no change in risk profile crossing asset thresholds. These firms become subject to increasingly complex and burdensome regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations. This is clearly not the intended or desired outcome, in that crossing these fixed thresholds has the unintended consequence of \"pushing down\" standards designed for larger and more complex banks to smaller and less complex ones. Compounding this problem is the overlapping and inconsistent thresholds used to define banks of different sizes and engaged in different activities. We should ask whether this additional complexity is necessary or even helpful, and to what extent it impairs economic growth.\nA simple fix would be for policymakers to adjust the community bank and other thresholds based on growth\u00e2\u0080\u0094and apply that adjusted threshold consistently\u00e2\u0080\u0094indexed to adjust for future growth. This approach would preserve the policy choice established when the threshold was initially set.\nDefining a community bank is an important first step, but it is just that, a first step. The next question is how to appropriately tailor regulations for these and other firms. Over the years, I have supported an approach to regulation grounded in asking some simple\u00e2\u0080\u0094but critical\u00e2\u0080\u0094threshold questions. What problem does each new and existing regulation solve? What are the costs of this approach? And importantly, what alternative approaches are available? When we look back at existing regulations, we can clearly identify areas for improvement. For example, the community bank leverage ratio, or \"CBLR,\" was designed as an optional\nalternative\nframework to risk-based capital requirements for community banks. A community bank that opts into the CBLR framework and complies with the established ratio is deemed to comply with risk-based capital requirements.\nBut if we look back at the history of the CBLR, the agencies approached the task of calibration primarily by evaluating how many banks would be eligible to opt in and calibrating the requirement to maintain the same high level of capital in this population of banks. In my view, this approach failed to achieve the relief Congress intended, and more fundamentally, failed to answer the critical questions we must consider in the rulemaking process.\nLet me turn to another area that needs to be addressed, the applications process. This process can also negatively impact community banks. It requires banks to seek approval from the Federal Reserve and other state and federal regulators for regulatory permission to engage in a transaction or activity. But this process can be unpredictable in terms of timing and information necessary to be ripe for consideration and approval. The costs of delay can be significant, damaging the value of the target bank, creating uncertainty for bank employees and customers, and resulting in costly delays for critical systems, integration contracts, and service agreements, potentially damaging the reputation of both firms.\nThe remedy is simple\u00e2\u0080\u0094regulatory application review should be effective, timely, and efficient. Banks should have a clear understanding of the information they must provide to complete the application well in advance. The standards for approval must be clearly defined and available to the public. And regulators should be prepared to act on a complete application within the statutory time frames. We have an opportunity to take a new approach, and we are doing so. We cannot accept the opacity of the status quo, especially when the \"fix\" is as simple as clear standards, clear forms, and prompt attention to and action on applications.\nOne area where we have improved transparency relates to mutual bank capital, which I have spoken about a number of times. Yesterday, the Board issued a series of frequently asked questions and two templates for mutual banks to use as they consider engaging in raising capital. These provide options for mutual banks to issue capital instruments that could qualify as tier 1 common equity or as additional tier 1 equity. These approaches are just a start\u00e2\u0080\u0094we are open to further refinement and improvement once mutuals have an opportunity to review and work to implement this new approach.\nI will conclude with a discussion about how we ensure that the supervisory process is appropriate for community banks. Regulators are once again working to incorporate \"tailoring\" to more effectively allocate supervisory and bank staffing resources. This allows the calibration of supervisory activities that are appropriate to a bank's size, risk, complexity, and business model. This approach is not new, but it has simply been ignored in recent years. Regulators have significant leeway in designing supervisory approaches, which may include issuing guidance that is technically non-binding but often plays a role similar to a regulatory requirement.\nHow do we address this problem?\nFirst, through greater transparency. Supervisory practices often escape public and internal scrutiny. They are developed with little public input, and they are not subject to public notice and comment requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act. Supervisory practices are not scrutinized after an exam because of the activity's designation as \"confidential supervisory information\" (CSI). \"CSI\" includes a broad array of bank and supervisory materials and actions taken in an exam context. The Fed continues to revise and redirect our supervisory practices, including the shift in focus toward material financial risk. These efforts would be most effective if accompanied by revisions to the definition and scope of CSI, which would promote greater public transparency and accountability.\nSecond, calibration of supervisory standards. Supervisory findings inform bank ratings, which can have follow-on effects like limiting options for mergers and acquisitions activity; raising the cost of liquidity; or diverting resources away from other, more important bank management priorities. We need to ensure that supervisory practices are appropriately calibrated so that a bank's supervisory ratings reflect its financial condition and material financial risks.\nClosing Thoughts\nBefore we close out today's conference, I would like to again thank all of our attendees, both those here with us and those online. We appreciate the continued support for community banks across the United States. I would especially like to thank the community bankers who work tirelessly to support their customers, businesses, and local economies. Thank you for joining us today.\nIn my role as the Vice Chair for Supervision, my responsibilities extend across banks of all sizes, from the largest GSIB to a single-branch community bank operating in an underserved rural market. The Fed's regulatory and supervisory approaches to this wide range of firms must be tailored to address the unique characteristics of each type and size of institution. A one-size-fits-all approach that pushes down requirements from the larger banks to the smallest ones results in overregulation and excessive supervision that is not appropriate for the size, risk, complexity, and business model of community banks. Today, we have the opportunity to right-size the frameworks for each size of institution, and I look forward to working together with my colleagues at the FDIC and OCC to accomplish this goal, through sensible reforms and more appropriate supervisory approaches.\n1.

Barr\nAt the Economic Club of Minnesota Luncheon, Golden Valley, Minnesota\nShare\nThank you to the Economic Club of Minnesota for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nI'm happy to be here for several reasons, one of which is that I have roots in Minnesota. My grandmother was born and raised in Eveleth, where her parents ran a small clothing store they opened in 1906 to serve the growing population that came here in the iron ore mining boom of that era. That generation's hard work and dreams of a better future helped build this great state as well as the prosperous economy that this club and the Federal Reserve are both dedicated to fostering.\nWe are midway between the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and our next meeting at the end of this month. At our last meeting in September, we decided to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points, a decision I supported. My FOMC colleagues and I also updated our projections for the economic outlook for the next couple of years and gave our assessments of the likely appropriate policy rate path as economic conditions evolve. In my remarks today, I will share my own thinking related to those decisions last month, and how incoming data and other developments have subsequently shaped my views as we head into the FOMC's next meeting in three weeks. That includes the economic implications of various developments in Washington including the federal government shutdown, which I imagine is on the minds of many of you today.\nWe are currently in a challenging position, because the risks to both sides of the FOMC's mandate\u00e2\u0080\u0094employment and inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094are elevated. I agree with Chair Powell's succinct view that there is no risk-free path forward for monetary policy. While inflation has come down a great deal since 2021, it is still above our 2 percent target and is now rising. And although several data points indicate that the labor market may be roughly in balance, we also know there has been a sharp drop in job creation since May, which suggests risks to the labor market going forward. The most difficult circumstances for making monetary policy decisions are when both mandate variables are at risk.\nLet me start with inflation. The latest data show that 12-month headline inflation based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose again in August to 2.7 percent. Core PCE inflation, which has historically been a good guide to future inflation, was 2.9 percent. After falling from its high of 7.2 percent in mid-2022 to 2.3 percent in April of this year, PCE inflation has been rising since then.\nThat timing is no coincidence. Research by Federal Reserve staff and others indicates that the increase in inflation since April has likely owed largely to the sharp increase in tariffs that kicked in around then. There are various measures of the overall level of tariffs. For assessing how tariffs are affecting inflation, I find it helpful to look at tariff collections relative to imports, which gives us a measure of the real effective tariff rate paid as goods come into the country. This rate has risen sharply this year, reaching about 11 percent in August, and is likely to rise further in the near term.\nThe tariff hikes have boosted core goods inflation, and at the same time progress on core services inflation has stalled. I expect that core PCE inflation will end the year over 3 percent.\nThe median FOMC participant estimates that headline PCE inflation will not return to our 2 percent target until the end of 2027, more than two years from today and six and a half years since inflation began rising in 2021. This would be the longest period of PCE inflation above 2 percent since a seven-year stretch that ended in 1993. I recognize that the economy and the American people have been hit by a series of unusual economic shocks in recent years\u00e2\u0080\u0094the COVID-19 pandemic and related shutdowns, disrupted supply chains for goods and labor shortages, higher energy costs from Russia's war on Ukraine, and the sudden increase in tariffs this year. Even so, after the high inflation Americans have endured, two more years would be a long time to wait for a return to our target, and that possibility weighs on my judgment for appropriate monetary policy.\nI am also concerned about further upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations. While the immediate effects of tariffs on inflation have been smaller than most economic forecasters had expected, the inventories built up in anticipation of the tariffs may have had a role in easing the immediate impact, as have compressed profit margins. While that is good news for inflation, the corresponding bad news is that firms will eventually run down those inventories and will only be able to compress margins for a while. Many importers, and firms affected by imports, are reporting that they are waiting as long as possible to pass on the costs from tariffs to their customers, mostly by temporarily reducing profit margins.\n2\nNormalizing margins over time implies a gradual, but longer, upward trajectory for inflation, a pattern of price increases that I fear could convince many consumers that higher inflation is going to be more of a permanent phenomenon. This is important because expectations of future inflation affect spending decisions in the near term and can drive a cycle of escalating inflation, as we saw after prices began rising in 2021.\nWith that experience in mind, I am skeptical of assurances that we should fully \"look through\" higher inflation from import tariffs. While, in principle, tariffs are a one-time increase in prices and should not sustainably raise inflation, that may not be the case if prices keep rising month after month and affect expectations. There has been nothing \"one-time\" or predictable about these tariff increases, which have ratcheted upward this year on particular countries and particular sectors in a series of steps. At some point, businesses and consumers could start to make pricing, spending, and wage decisions based on their belief in higher future inflation, thereby driving a cycle of persistence. Measures of near-term inflation expectations are down from peaks in April when tariffs were announced, but they are still higher than last year.\nAs a result, I believe the Federal Reserve's price stability goal faces significant risks. That said, there are some factors that mitigate these risks. In particular, the softer labor market could help keep inflation in check by making it harder for workers to bargain for higher wages even if people expect their cost of living to increase, and by making it harder for businesses to fully pass through price increases to consumers. In addition, the more gradual effect of tariffs on prices has not, to date, led to the type of supply chain dislocations that can have pronounced second-round effects on inflation. Also, longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.\nSo let's turn to the labor market. While we do not have the full complement of labor market data because the government shutdown has delayed the Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment report, we do know that the payroll services firm ADP found that private-sector employment shrank last month, in keeping with a slowdown in job creation since May. Part of the slowing surely reflects developments on the supply side\u00e2\u0080\u0094from both reduced net immigration and somewhat reduced labor force participation\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it is unclear exactly how much. As a result, it is challenging to gauge exactly how much labor demand has softened. Growth in labor supply has declined significantly, with perhaps as many as a million fewer people in the workforce than would have been expected based on the typical pattern of immigration that prevailed in the years prior to the pandemic. With a reduced supply of labor, what constitutes a healthy growth rate for employment would be smaller. One can see that slower labor supply growth has been an important factor in the weaker job creation, because over the period that job gains have slowed significantly, the unemployment rate has only edged up to 4.3 percent, a level typically associated with a sound labor market.\nOther measures suggest that labor supply and demand remain in the same rough balance they have been in for more than a year. The ratio of job openings to the number of people looking for work is around 1, the level that has persisted since about the middle of 2024. Likewise, the rate of people losing their jobs is running at the same rate that it has for the past two and a half years, and there is no sign of an impending jump in the unemployment rate in the weekly reports of new claims for unemployment insurance. That said, even if the labor market is still roughly in balance, the fact that this balance is being achieved from simultaneous slowing in labor supply growth and in hiring suggests that the labor market is more vulnerable to negative shocks.\nIn addition, despite the low and relatively steady unemployment rate, household perceptions of the labor market have deteriorated and are below the level they reached in the strong labor market immediately before the pandemic. According to the New York Fed's survey of consumers, people's perceptions of their chance of finding a new job if they lost their current job fell sharply in August to the lowest reading since the survey started in June 2013. It rebounded somewhat in September, but remained at levels seen in 2013, when the labor market was weak. Also, components of the workforce that are usually an early indication of cyclical changes in the labor market have deteriorated. The unemployment rate for Black or African American workers, which reached a historic low in 2023, is back to its highest level since the pandemic. Unemployment rates for younger workers are also up.\nOne reason I take these signals seriously is that experience shows that when labor markets turn down, it can happen suddenly. With job growth near zero for the past several months, the labor market could decline precipitously if the economy is hit with another shock. Growth in gross domestic product (GDP) has slowed significantly this year; however, earlier concerns of a continued slowdown seem to be fading. After a negative reading in the first quarter, real GDP grew at a 3.8 percent rate in the second quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0094smoothing through to a rate of 1.6 percent for the first half of the year. Strong spending and other data for the third quarter indicate that GDP remained strong last quarter. While I expect that tariffs and lower labor supply have weighed on growth and will continue to do so, I do not yet see significant risks in the growth data, though I remain attuned to risks from a variety of factors. It is hard to judge at this point whether the federal government shutdown will leave a noticeable imprint on economic growth, because we don't know how long it will last, and whether it may result in sustained changes in government spending. Based on past shutdowns, it is most likely that a shutdown would reduce GDP growth in the quarter in which it occurs and then boost growth in the subsequent quarter by the same amount.\nAs I said earlier, this economic outlook, and the associated uncertainties that underlie it, pose challenges for judging the correct stance of monetary policy as well as the appropriate path forward, given that the risks to achieving both components of our mandate are elevated.\nWith the easing in output growth and the likelihood of tariffs and labor supply weighing on the economy in the months ahead, we need to be prepared for the possibility that the softening in the labor market will become something worse, especially if there is a further adverse shock to demand.\nAt the same time, inflation, which made steady progress last year toward the FOMC's 2 percent goal, has moved up in 2025, especially after the sharp increase in tariffs, which keep rising. I have laid out my reasons for believing that the so far modest impact of tariffs on inflation probably means a much longer-lasting rachet upward, potentially affecting expectations in a way that makes the job of taming inflation harder.\nIn balancing and managing these risks to the FOMC's goals, I supported the Committee's decision on September 17 to lower the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. Monetary policy was and remains modestly restrictive, so it seemed to me appropriate to move the rate a bit closer toward neutral, pending more data and further developments on the economy, the forecast, and the balance of risks. Since that meeting, we have learned that consumer spending has been on a notably stronger trajectory than previously indicated, leading most observers to revise up estimates of spending and GDP growth for the rest of the year. We also got confirmation that PCE inflation moved up as expected, and that core inflation remains well above the FOMC's target. Another development was the announcement of new tariffs on imports of heavy trucks, medicine, and furniture.\nThere was, and remains, considerable uncertainty about the future course of the economy. It is possible that recent low payroll growth is a harbinger of worse to come, or that payroll growth eventually strengthens, consistent with the low unemployment rate and sound growth. It is possible that tariffs will have only a modest impact on the course of prices and that progress resumes toward 2 percent inflation next year, but it is also possible that both inflation and expectations of future inflation escalate.\nCommon sense would indicate that when there is a lot of uncertainty, one should move cautiously. This is validated by past monetary policymaking experience, and a particular research insight from nearly 60 years ago. The Brainard principle, developed by economist William Brainard, holds that when there is considerable uncertainty about the consequences of a policy action, the recommended course is to move more gradually than would otherwise be the case.\n3\nI believe that principle applies now, and that the FOMC should be cautious about adjusting policy so that we can gather further data, update our forecasts, and better assess the balance of risks. If we see inflation moving further away from our target, then it may be necessary to keep policy at least modestly restrictive for longer. If we see heightened risks in the labor market, then we may need to move more quickly to ease policy. The FOMC can, and I believe would, act forcefully to stabilize the economy if necessary.\nI think a cautious approach will help us to balance the risks to both sides of our mandate as we continue to assess the economic outlook.\nThank you.\n1.

It's a privilege to be here today at the Federal Reserve Board with so many of our nation's community bank CEOs. I want to start by thanking our bankers for the essential work you do every day\u00e2\u0080\u0094serving your communities, supporting small businesses and families and keeping local economies strong and growing. Today's event provides us an opportunity to come together and discuss the future of community banking.\nThis great nation hosts the largest and most effective financial system in the world, ensuring that capital flows to those who need it and can put it to productive use. I think of community banks as the foundation of our financial system. You are often the first call for small businesses seeking to grow, for families looking to buy homes, and for anyone seeking to achieve their financial goals. At a time of rapid technological change, a shifting regulatory landscape, and evolving consumer expectations, your work has never been more vital or more challenging.\nThe purpose of this conference is about\nlooking ahead\n, at the opportunities, risks and innovations that will shape the future of community banking. It's also about\ntelling the community bank story\n: not only the services you provide and impact you have in your communities but also the value of having strong, profitable and well-managed companies as the foundation of the banking system. There's a story to tell here and we want to ensure\ncommunity banks tell it and create their own their narrative\n.\nThis conference brings together more than a hundred community bank CEOs in person and many more attending virtually. Our panels will include CEOs from across our diverse financial system. I look forward to hearing directly from these leaders to share what they are seeing\u00e2\u0080\u0094emerging trends, economic shifts and innovations that are shaping the financial system, including the impact of artificial intelligence and fraud, and which may affect your businesses. This conference also brings a broader perspective, from our Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, to new technologies with Paxos CEO Chad Cascarilla to private credit and global outlook with Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, and consumer digital platforms with Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev. These leaders will help us think more broadly about how economic and industry developments intersect with community banking.\nAnother special guest joining us today is CNBC host Jim Cramer, who will moderate a panel of experienced community bank CEOs who have a combined century of banking leadership. Today, we will showcase how community bankers have consistently adapted, innovated, and outperformed while staying true to their mission. These efforts do not necessarily make headlines on the front page of the business section, but they should. And there's no one better to help elevate the community bank narrative and amplify the value that community banks bring to America's economy than CNBC's Jim Cramer.\nFinally, we will also host a traditional policy panel, featuring community bank CEOs discussing capital and liquidity regulation. This session will provide an opportunity for a thoughtful, candid discussion about how our regulatory frameworks affect your institutions and your ability to serve your communities. These conversations are essential to help shape our thinking and inform how we as regulators work to ensure that policies are effective, fair, and balanced.\nThe goal and the theme running through all of today's panels is clear: there is tremendous support from the public and private sector for a strong, resilient, thriving community banking industry\n. Each of our sessions today reflects a shared belief in the importance of community banks to America's economic future.\nThank you for being with us today. Now I would like to thank our Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for taking time from his busy schedule to be here to discuss community banking, and I will now invite him to share his insight with us.\nRelated Content\nCommunity Bank Conference\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            October 09, 2025",

I am sorry that I'm traveling and could not be with you today. Thank you to Vice Chair for Supervision Miki Bowman for hosting this conference. Thank you also to all the Board staff that made this event possible.\nCommunity banks play a vital role in the U.S. financial system because they have strong links to the people and businesses they serve, and direct knowledge of local economic conditions. These close ties allow community bankers to better understand their customers, and the ensuing products and services for those they serve. I saw this clearly when I led the Board's community and regional bank subcommittee as a governor. I have also seen the critical role of community banks in the communities where I have lived, including as a community-bank customer.\nToday's event is a helpful opportunity for Fed leaders to hear from community bankers and learn more about the issues you face. We are committed to understanding these issues. And we have long been committed to tailoring our supervisory practices as appropriate for community banks to reduce unnecessary burden, while still ensuring that community banks continue to operate in a safe and sound manner.\nThank you for being here today to share your knowledge and experience. And thank you for being such a vital part of the communities you serve.\nRelated Content\nCommunity Bank Conference\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            October 09, 2025",

Barr\nAt the Center for Indian Country Development Tenth Anniversary and Data Summit, Minneapolis, Minnesota\nShare\nWatch Live\nGood afternoon. Thank you for the invitation to be here to help mark the 10th anniversary of the Center for Indian Country Development (CICD) and to further the goal of advancing development through better data.\n1\nIt's a privilege to be in the presence of so many tribal leaders, Federal Reserve colleagues, policymakers, researchers, and practitioners all working to advance Native economies. My experiences traveling with CICD and engaging in CICD's work have been a meaningful part of my time at the Federal Reserve.\nAt the Board of Governors, I serve as the oversight governor for our Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, which supports the community development function across the Federal Reserve System. It's a role that means a great deal to me. Community development has been a cornerstone of my career\u00e2\u0080\u0094as a governor, banking regulator, and earlier in my career as a scholar, university leader, and the Treasury Department's point person on community development in the 1990s.\nI'd like to focus my remarks today on why I think the work you all are doing is critical to the prosperity of Native nations and Indigenous communities, and why that success matters for our country.\nTwo years ago, I traveled to western Montana with CICD staff. We visited the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, which is home to the Blackfeet Nation, and the Flathead Indian Reservation, which is home to the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes.\nOn our visit, I saw examples of tribal leaders diversifying their economies through tribally owned enterprises\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then leveraging revenues from those enterprises to reinvest in their communities. I heard from business leaders struggling with supply chain challenges and community members pulling together to address housing supply and affordability issues.\n2\nAt a community roundtable, financial leaders talked about credit needs in their regions including challenges with limited credit and access to financial services and distance from banks.\nThese issues take center stage in CICD's research. And in our conversations, research served as a springboard for a variety of community members and leaders to come together to explore solutions. This is why community engagement is a critical part of community development, and a huge value add for the Federal Reserve as we seek to understand how people are experiencing the economy.\nI see this same spirit of working together on behalf of a better future\u00e2\u0080\u0094grounded in research\u00e2\u0080\u0094on display here today.\nEconomic Gaps and Data Needs in Indian Country\nThere remain persistent economic gaps in Indian Country based on many metrics. Native Americans have lower household income, and poverty is a significant problem on reservations.\n3\nAccording to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED Survey), Native American households consistently report a lower likelihood of having the cash to pay for a $400 emergency expense, which is a common measure of financial security.\n4\nLooking at the labor force, unemployment is higher for Native American workers than for workers overall. Research has also documented a lack of financial institutions near reservations, which restricts capital and credit availability. A recent study showed that Native-owned small businesses were less likely to receive the financing they applied for, even though they were much more likely to apply for small amounts of credit.\n5\nNative Americans also face a higher cost of homeownership.\nEconomic downturns can exacerbate gaps, such as when social-distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately harmed sectors such as gaming and entertainment in which many tribally owned businesses are concentrated.\nAddressing these persistent challenges requires coordination with local leaders to achieve progress. During my first stint at the Treasury in the 1990s, I co-chaired a working group whose objective was to reduce barriers to mortgage lenders and expand access to credit in Indian Country, with pilot programs in the Navajo Nation and Oglala Sioux Pine Ridge Reservation. The working group helped map out a clearer process for residents to obtain mortgages by coordinating tribal governmental, federal, and lender roles.\n6\nI see this as an example of potential progress that can be made when national and local leaders and the private sector leverage research and come together to find solutions, but also as a reminder that these are long-standing problems that are still with us today.\nIn other ways, tribal governments have been proactive in diversifying their revenue streams and innovating in their use of economic data to make evidence-based decisions. Native Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) are addressing credit gaps in their communities with culturally informed lending practices and financial services. There are many examples of initiatives targeting specific economic challenges. We see signs of progress, including positive trends in Native American employment and household income. But we'll only know whether we're making economic gains in Indian Country over time if we have timely, high-quality data disaggregated for Native peoples and geographies. Data dashboards are not just for researchers. They help tribal nations and decisionmakers in many capacities make informed decisions about how to allocate resources, design interventions, and monitor economic growth.\nWe know that Indian Country has sometimes been referred to as the \"asterisk nation\" as a result of insufficient sample sizes of Native Americans in national datasets. Experiences in which external researchers used data in ways that were harmful to tribal communities have also contributed to mistrust of research and data in Indian Country. At the same time, many tribal governments have limited resources to allocate toward their own data collection.\nResearch and Data Advancements\nResearch and data advancements in Indian Country are changing this narrative. Over the past decade, CICD's research has advanced our understanding of the pillars of tribal economies and potential interventions.\n7\nWe've learned more about the role of tribal governments and tribal enterprises in local and regional economies, and the ways tribal treasuries are distinctive from those of local and state governments. CICD's research has helped us understand how infrastructure gaps such as broadband access can impede economic growth and leave communities more vulnerable to economic shocks. And it's provided research insights on strategies for increasing access to capital and credit in Native communities.\nMuch of this research has taken place in collaboration with Native organizations, tribal governments, and economic development practitioners. In some of these areas, such as research on the practices and outcomes of Native CDFIs, CICD and its collaborators have provided some of the first systematic quantitative analysis in the field.\nCICD has also developed a suite of data tools that empower community members and decisionmakers to explore economic conditions at local to national levels and monitor trends over time.\nIndian Country's Relevance to the Broader Economy\nThis work to advance economic research and data in Indian Country matters to the overall economy. The Federal Reserve promotes a healthy economy and a stable financial system for everyone, and that simply cannot be done without supporting strong and sustainable communities in Indian Country. Research tells us that Native economies are closely intertwined with local and regional economies. Examples include tribal casinos attracting visitors to surrounding businesses and Native enterprises subcontracting with non-Native-owned businesses.\nCICD's mission supports the Federal Reserve's community development function, which works to promote access to credit, investment, and financial services in low- and moderate-income communities, and foster a better understanding of their economic conditions. This happens in a few ways.\nAs members of the Federal Open Market Committee, my colleagues and I decide on the appropriate setting for monetary policy. In this role, it's vital that we understand how a variety of individuals, institutions, and communities experience the economy. Research from CICD and community development teams here in Minneapolis and across the Federal Reserve System sheds light on economic circumstances in our communities.\nAs important as it is, monetary policy isn't the main thing that matters to a healthy economy. Businesses, financial practitioners, nonprofits, community leaders, and decisionmakers at many levels all need research and data to make evidence-based decisions and promote thriving and economically resilient communities. The community development function provides this research and convening power to advance our collective understanding of local financial needs.\nOur community development work also provides timely, on-the-ground insights on developments in the financial system. A prime example of this is the series of surveys CICD conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. These surveys provided real-time glimpses of the challenges that tribal governments, businesses, and community leaders were facing as a result of the pandemic.\nIn addition, under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve has a statutory obligation to supervise how banks meet the credit needs of the communities they serve, consistent with safe and sound lending practices. And that very much includes communities in Indian Country. And we need good data and analysis to fulfill our statutory obligations.\nWhat it comes down to is that the Federal Reserve does our best work when we understand what's happening in communities, and that includes the rich variety of communities across Indian Country.\nLearning from Indian Country\nAs we look to the future, decisionmakers inside and outside of Indian Country can learn from the ways tribal governments have served their communities and guided their economies through many challenges. In my visits with tribal leaders, I have been inspired by their long-range vision\u00e2\u0080\u0094considering how decisions today will affect their ability to care for their communities for generations into the future.\nI've also come to appreciate their grit and creativity in meeting community needs, whether it be through starting a tribal bank to meet local financial service needs, leveraging tribal enterprises to create employment opportunities, or innovating in their use of economic data to tailor public services to their communities.\nMuch has been said about the economic challenges in Indian Country, but perhaps what has impressed me the most in my visits is the sense of optimism for the future from so many people I have met, despite these challenges.\nThank you for the important ways you are coming together to use research and data to propel your communities forward. It's an honor to be here with you.\n1.

Barr\nAt the 2025 Community Banking Research Conference, St. Louis, Missouri\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you today.\n1\nI value the opportunity to spend time with community bankers and fellow federal and state bank regulators. This conference, now in its 13th year, is always a great forum for those interactions. All of us benefit from the research presented here, which helps us understand the opportunities for banks to strengthen communities, and the challenges that community banks face. So, I want to thank the researchers presenting. Thank you also to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) for co-sponsoring this gathering, and to the Federal Reserve staff who each year do their part to bring it about. More broadly, I very much appreciate the close and longstanding collaboration between the Federal Reserve, the CSBS, and the FDIC.\nThroughout my career, a major focus of my work has been building stronger communities. To do much of that building, households and small businesses need access to credit, and I have known for a long time that community banks and community bankers play an indispensable role in the towns, rural areas, and cities they serve. Stronger community banks mean stronger communities.\nCommunity banks, sometimes the only banking option in a community, offer a consequential difference in customer experience. Even in communities that may also have local branches of larger banks, there is often a considerable, and I think meaningful, differentiation in the customer satisfaction at a community bank. At branches of larger banks, the customer experience can be subject to layers of authorizations involving phone calls and approvals (or denials) from people who are not part of the community and may lack a deep understanding of local industries and conditions. Much of this relates to the understandable need for larger institutions to adopt more standardized and centralized processes, powered by technology, to boost efficiency and lower costs. It is easier than ever before to apply for an increasing variety of loans online, and this is something that community banks are taking advantage of as well. But this is where the benefit that community banks provide really shows.\nCommunity bankers are part of their communities. They know and care about their customers. They have an inherent advantage in understanding the needs and the challenges of local businesses and households. This is not just a matter of being friendly and welcoming to customers. Beyond the numbers on a loan application, what community bankers understand about their neighbors is \"soft information\" that can be used to make better credit decisions. Relationship banking, especially with local business owners, is critical for those businesses\u00e2\u0080\u0094but also for community banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094because it gives them an ongoing edge in the ever-intensifying competition from larger banks and nonbank lenders. Knowing your customer is also crucial in preventing crime, such as fraud, which remains a top concern for community bankers.\nThe pressure of competition is a very real challenge for community banks, but the advantages I speak of are real as well. I know you heard yesterday from several banks, including those that are modestly sized and have competed very effectively with much larger banks. Community banks have earned the trust and the business of people in their communities because of an understanding that the banks' successes depend on their communities succeeding. Those common interests are a powerful force that drives customer retention amid all the competition.\nWhat is the future of community banking? I note that the session immediately after my remarks today is \"Innovation and Technology in Small Business Lending.\" Indeed, technology is a big part of this year's conference, so you won't be surprised to hear me say that I believe it is a big part of what will determine the future of community banking. I know you've already gotten the results of this year's Annual Survey of Community Banks by CSBS, where \"technology and related costs\" ranked second as a concern, behind only cybersecurity, which is itself largely about technology. Most respondents said that the adoption of new or emerging technologies was very or extremely important, and not a single banker said it wasn't important at all.\nUntil fairly recently, the big technological disruption in banking came from fintech and an onslaught of new lending from nonbanks. This year's CSBS survey reported the largest-ever increase in respondents who saw heightened competition from nonbank payment services firms. Larger banks are also competing with community banks online. Increased choice for small businesses and consumers is a good thing, but community banks have had to continue to innovate to compete. Community banks often turn to third-party service providers to help them offer products and services to compete with larger banks and fintechs. Managing the risks related to these third-party arrangements has been a considerable job for community banks. The Fed and other regulators have offered guidance about this task, to serve as a resource and to make the supervisory implications of third-party risk management as predictable as possible.\nAs with many of the big questions facing community banking, technology represents risk and opportunity. It allows community banks to reach customers more effectively and to offer new products and services, but it also demands investment and vigilance. One of the challenges for community banks is to adopt technologies or form partnerships that allow them to deepen customer relationships but not attenuate or replace them. In interactions with Federal Reserve supervisors about third-party services, banks tell us that they hear a lot of sales pitches for algorithmic lending, outsourcing customer service, and the like, when what they are really looking for is an app that can enhance relationship banking: their natural advantage.\nAny discussion about technological advances has to give prominent attention to artificial intelligence, and I note that later this morning a paper on the use of AI technology will be part of an upcoming session. Before I get into what AI might mean for community banking, let me say that AI has been of particular interest to me, and I have spoken about it several times this year, because of the technology's potential to transform both our economy, and in other fundamental ways, how we live and interact with each other in society.\n2\nWhile there is high uncertainty about these outcomes, I believe that the speed at which AI is being implemented means that we should all be thinking about the full range of possibilities and be prepared for any one of them to come to pass, perhaps sooner than we think.\nAI was included for the first time in the CSBS survey in 2024, when AI for customer support was an important focus for 31 percent of respondents, a share that jumped to 47 percent in this year's survey. Of course, earlier forms of AI have been used by larger banks in customer service for many years, and the big development for community banks seems to be that newer forms of GenAI could be lowering costs and expanding access enough to make it cost-effective for smaller institutions.\nCustomer service is one obvious area where AI could change community banking, but there are others. Cybersecurity and fraud have been and continue to be leading concerns for community bankers, and AI represents new opportunities for addressing these concerns. It is my understanding that automated fraud detection, in particular, hasn't been cost effective for some community banks, which haven't been able to compete with larger banks that have the economies of scale to deploy these services. But the huge buildout in AI capacity now underway, along with the explosion in the number of firms seeking to get into AI-based services, may have the potential for driving down costs enough to make AI-based fraud detection more feasible for community banks.\nYet, AI represents new risks as well as new opportunities.\n3\nIn addition to community banks worrying about criminals defrauding them or their customers with forgeries on checks or in credit card transactions, they face a new threat from entirely forged identities, with so-called \"deepfakes.\" Deepfakes use GenAI to recreate voices and images of real people, allowing fraudsters to hold convincing conversations using simulated voices that sound like the individual they are impersonating, responding in ways that person might realistically respond. Using only a brief sample of audio and access to information about individuals on the internet, criminals employing GenAI can impersonate a close relative in a crisis or a high-value bank client seeking to complete a transaction at their bank. What was once the stuff of movies is now a reality, and a lot is at stake. The direct and indirect costs of all cybercrimes have already grown from 1 percent to 10 percent of global gross domestic product.\n4\nThe use of deepfakes in cybercrime is growing very quickly. According to one source, there has been a twentyfold increase in deepfake attacks over the last three years.\n5\nCommunity bankers also need to be aware of the potential for AI to affect customers' livelihoods. I tend to be an optimist about the potential for AI to make workers more productive, raise living standards, and create more jobs in new industries, but I am realistic in my expectation that it could cause considerable dislocation of workers and businesses, at least in the short run.\n6\nCommunities dependent on a small number of employers or a single industry that is significantly affected by AI could experience these dislocations. At the same time, the large investments underway in data centers, many of them in remote or rural areas where electricity is less expensive, could bring new business for community banks. For example, during the most recent Community Advisory Council (CAC) meeting, the Federal Reserve Board heard about a major data center built in Ellendale, North Dakota, a community of less than 1,500 people. The CAC member noted that the addition of a major data center had vastly increased the community's needs for services. At this point it is hard to tell how much AI will truly transform the economy and banking, but I think that community bankers will need to be prepared to change, as ever, if your communities are affected.\nI have covered a couple topics so far today. I have spoken about the advent of fintech, and the way it is transforming banking and competition between community banks and larger banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094risks and opportunities. I have spoken about technology more generally, and specifically about how artificial intelligence may change the economy and banking. Many of these uncertainties echo those that most workers and businesses are facing in our fast-evolving economy. One group of people that I believe have dealt very effectively with a changing economy are community bankers. Considering the changes that have swept over our banking and financial system over the decades, if you are a community banker sitting here today, that itself is a testament to your ingenuity, resilience, and adaptability. But I would be remiss if I didn't discuss a further challenge to community banks in this regulatory environment\u00e2\u0080\u0094deregulation of large banks.\nAs community bankers well know, it was not community banks that fueled the 2008 financial crisis\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was the largest, most complex firms whose excessive risk-taking nearly brought down the system. In the years since, strong reforms\u00e2\u0080\u0094higher capital, tougher liquidity requirements, and rigorous stress testing\u00e2\u0080\u0094have helped to safeguard our economy. Yet recent proposed rollbacks in capital standards for the largest banks, in the supervisory framework for large financial institutions, and in the rigor of stress testing of large banks threaten to erode those protections. These shifts would not make the system safer; they would leave community banks once again exposed to the fallout if the largest players stumble. Because we cannot afford to repeat those mistakes, I have spoken out against weakening standards for large banks, and I will continue to do so.\nIn closing, I'll note my admiration for community bankers who know how to confront uncertainty, to sort out the risks and the opportunities, and make the decisions and investments that have allowed community banks to continue to play the indispensable role you serve for your customers and communities. We all share an interest in responsible regulation, which means promoting the safety and soundness of community banks and compliance with applicable law but also ensuring that regulation is appropriate to the size, business model, and risk profile of regulated institutions. We all want community banks to succeed and continue to play their important role in the communities they serve. One reason that I believe community banking has a bright future is that all the people here today recognize the unique and essential function of community banks in our financial system and are helping to support community banking.\nThank you.\n1.

We are proud of this ongoing partnership with CSBS and FDIC and the effort to further actionable bank industry research.\nAs the former Kansas state bank commissioner and a community banker, I very much appreciate the goals of this conference. And again this year, the organizers have included valuable research and created a conference program that includes a wide range of perspectives that create an opportunity for discussion and debate.\nEnsuring the future and viability of the community banking industry continues to be a top priority, especially as the President appointed me to serve as the Vice Chair for Supervision of the Federal Reserve Board.\nThis position, which was created under the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, requires the Vice Chair to \"develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution holding companies and other financial firms supervised by the Board\" and to also \"oversee the supervision and regulation\" of these firms.\nIt is an honor and an absolute privilege to be entrusted with these important responsibilities, and I look forward to working with all of our stakeholders in the financial industry to modernize supervision and regulation that allows for continued economic growth and innovation in the banking system and that enhances the critical role of community banks.\nCommunity banks are the cornerstone of local economies, providing credit to local customers and businesses with few alternatives for accessing financial services. The community bank relationship model requires just that relationship. Direct knowledge of and a connection with the community, which makes this banking model truly unique and even more valuable.\nBut this model continues to face challenges\u00e2\u0080\u0094challenges that I am confident this conference will explore in greater detail that will help us to inform future policy developments.\nWhen I spoke at this conference last year, I described a framework for community banking regulation for the future.\nIn those remarks, I discussed the necessary building blocks for building an effective framework, which include\nreviewing, reconsidering, and indexing the asset size thresholds that are used throughout our current supervisory and regulatory framework;\ngaining a better understanding of the tradeoffs of regulation;\nidentifying the hidden costs of supervision and supervisory guidance;\nstreamlining the mergers and acquisitions review and approval process; and\nidentifying ways to promote new bank formation.\nSince that time, the Federal Reserve has already launched several initiatives to advance these goals, but there's more work ahead.\nWe are refocusing supervisory efforts on core material financial risks, reviewing the CAMELS ratings framework, revising the community bank leverage ratio, and considering ways to improve the treatment of mutual banks. We are also prioritizing work to assist in the fight against fraud.\nIn the coming years, this conference will be an important mechanism for continuing to explore challenges facing the banking industry, and especially community banks. And with the work we are undertaking, we will continue to prioritize changes to the community bank regulatory and supervisory framework that will allow community banks to continue to thrive.\nOver the years, this conference has highlighted the important role community banks play in our economy, the impacts of regulation on our banks, the disproportionate cost burden from regulation on our nation's smallest banks, and the importance of having a strong diversified network of community banks. It is critical that our regulatory and supervisory framework continues to support a network of these banks across and throughout the country so that they are positioned to support the economy and to meet the credit needs of their communities.\nAs I work with staff across the Federal Reserve to enhance the Fed's supervision of banks, I'm reminded how the research presented at this conference over the years, along with the findings from the CSBS annual survey of community banks, has consistently demonstrated the need for regulatory tailoring. This has given us a better perspective to understand and measure the cost of compliance.\nIn short, this conference truly matters.\nEach year, the research presented here moves us forward; improves our understanding; and, combined with other insights from key stakeholders and our own experiences, enables us to make better regulatory and supervisory decisions.\nFrom the first year of the conference in 2013, we've seen a number of changes in the banking and financial systems, in our economy, and in our supervisory and regulatory structures. The research presented here each year has evolved with these changes and has delivered critical and timely insights.\nI'm so pleased that this conference has not strayed from its original mission and continues to provide a forum for the discussion of thoughtful, timely research into our country's unique community banking business model.\nCommunity banks are vital to the U.S. economy and to the thousands of smaller local economies they serve across the country. It's important that we continue to study and understand the important role they play.\nThis conference helps to increase this understanding.\nIn addition to presenting thoughtful research, it provides an opportunity for open dialogue between community bankers, academics, regulators, and policymakers.\nIn these ever-changing times, the unique combination of research presented in combination with real-world perspectives provides insights that help to ensure that the community banking model endures well into the future.\nThis conference is just one aspect of the Federal Reserve System's engagement on issues affecting community banks. Outreach to banks of all sizes, including community banks, has been a top priority for my work because your voices must be a part of the conversation in Washington. In a few days, the Board will host a Community Bank Conference in D.C., bringing together bankers, industry experts, and other stakeholders to discuss and identify the most relevant issues facing the industry.\nThis event will be live-streamed on the Board's website and will include several unique and exciting speakers and panelists, covering a number of current issues.\nThank you for your continued interest and engagement in supporting this conference.\n1.

Jefferson\nAt the Drexel Economic Forum, Drexel University LeBow College of Business, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nShare\nThank you, Dean Madan. I appreciate the opportunity to speak here at Drexel University and to visit Philadelphia, an area where I have spent much of my personal and professional life.\n1\nI will not go on too much about the City of Brotherly Love other than to say I am considering jogging up the steps of the art museum before I catch my train home.\nslide 1\nIt is an honor to take part in the inaugural Drexel Economic Forum and to meet some of the students, researchers, and business leaders who are here. It is an important time for these groups to hold this event because there is much to discuss about the quickly evolving economy. For my part, as a Federal Reserve policymaker, I am committed to achieving the dual mandate given to us by Congress of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. Delivering on these goals matters to communities, families, and businesses across the country, including right here in Philadelphia.\nTo inform our\ndiscussion\ntoday, I will share with you my economic outlook and offer my current view of monetary policy before sharing with you some highlights from the Federal Reserve's newly revised monetary policy framework. After my remarks I look forward to answering a few questions.\nEconomic Outlook\nLooking broadly across the U.S. economy, I see that growth has moderated this year, and the risks to both sides of our dual mandate have shifted. Employment growth has slowed because of weaker growth in labor supply and a softening in labor demand. The uptick in the unemployment rate relative to the start of the year suggests that demand has fallen by a bit more than supply and that the downside risks to employment are rising. Meanwhile, higher tariffs are showing through to higher inflation for some goods. I expect that the effects of tariffs on inflation, employment, and economic activity will further show through in coming months.\nIn the first half of 2025, U.S.\nGDP\ngrew at a 1.6 percent annual rate, which reflects a marked cooling from last year's 2.4 percent growth rate. The slowdown in economic activity in the first half of this year was primarily driven by weaker consumer spending. That said, U.S. retail spending picked up over the summer. Overall, I expect the U.S. economy to maintain the first half's rate of growth through the remainder of the year.\nIn terms of the labor market, we did not receive the September jobs report this morning because of a lapse in federal government funding. While this is less than ideal, I never focus on a single report; rather, I look across an array of indicators to assess the labor market and the economy.\nThe available data from both government and private-sector sources point out that labor supply and demand are slowing together, as reflected in the ratio of\njob openings to unemployed\nAmericans seeking work. A few years ago, available jobs well exceeded the unemployment level. That came back into balance over the past year or so. Data released earlier this week showed the unemployment level slightly exceeded openings this summer, but what economists call the V/U ratio remains near 1. Similarly, last week the Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims continue to mostly trend sideways. Net immigration into the U.S., an important contributor to workforce growth, has dropped sharply, and that is a factor restraining a more significant increase in unemployment.\nTurning to the other side of our dual mandate, it is notable that\ninflation\nhas slowed considerably from the highs that occurred when the economy reopened after pandemic disruptions. Inflation, however, remains somewhat above our 2 percent target, and the tariffs that have been announced and implemented so far are showing up in some goods prices. Overall, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August. Core PCE inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094which removes volatile food and energy prices\u00e2\u0080\u0094was 2.9 percent in August.\nOften, it is helpful to study the three major\ncomponents of core PCE inflation\nto better understand what is driving overall price measures. Currently, core goods prices, which declined modestly last year, have been rising, reflecting tariff effects, although it is also notable that the increase so far has been smaller than what many forecasters predicted this spring. Meanwhile, core services inflation, outside of housing, has generally trended sideways this year, while housing inflation appears to be on a gradual downward trend.\nI view the uncertainty around my baseline outlook as especially high, mainly due to the changes in government policies and the challenges around assessing their net effects on employment and inflation. As the changes in these policies are finalized and we have more time to judge how they are affecting the economy, I expect some of the broader uncertainty around the U.S. economy to diminish.\nMonetary Policy\nConsidering the outlook I described, I see the risks to employment as tilted to the downside and risks to inflation to the upside. It follows that both sides of our mandate are under pressure.\nWhile tariff-related inflation is apparent in the prices of goods, tariff increases typically represent a one-time change in the price level. The scope and persistence of the related rise in inflation will be determined by several factors\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the final tariff rates, the extent of pass-through to consumer prices, the effects on supply chains, overall economic conditions, and what happens to longer-run inflation expectations. Short-term inflation expectations have come down from the peaks reached in the second quarter, and most measures of longer-term inflation expectations have been largely stable, suggesting that the American people understand our commitment to returning inflation to our 2 percent target. As such, I expect the disinflation process to resume after this year and inflation to return to the 2 percent target in the coming years.\nAs I noted above, trends across several data series indicate that the labor market is softening, which suggests that, left unsupported, it could experience stress. To balance the risk of persistent above-target inflation and the risk of a deteriorating labor market, I supported a 25 basis point cut in our target range at the last FOMC meeting. This change moved our\npolicy rate\ncloser to a more neutral stance while maintaining a balanced approach to promoting our dual-mandate objectives.\nWith respect to the path of the policy rate going forward, I will continue to evaluate the appropriate stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\u00e2\u0080\u00af I will also consider and assess information about government policies and their effects on the economy.\nThe Fed's Revised Framework\nNow that I have discussed my outlook and the latest policy decision, I want to turn to an important document that I use to guide those decisions: the\nStatement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy\n. This statement is designed to give the public a clear sense of how we think about monetary policy. As Chair Powell discussed at his Jackson Hole speech, a revised version of that document was issued in August.\n2\nThe framework document, often called the consensus statement, was first issued in 2012, under Chair Ben Bernanke's leadership. The Fed's dual mandate, established by Congress, to foster maximum employment and stable prices underpins this framework. Our commitment to delivering on our dual mandate is unwavering. The revisions to our framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions.\nThe FOMC revised its consensus statement after conducting a public review. That review consisted of three elements: first, Reserve Banks hosted\nFed Listens\nevents; second, the Board hosted a research conference; and third, we convened a series of policymaker discussions at FOMC meetings this year, supported by staff analysis. The changes implemented as a result of this review were a logical progression, not a change in course, grounded in our ever-evolving understanding of our economy. I will make note of\nfour adjustments\nto the consensus statement and discuss each in turn.\nFirst, the revised consensus statement removed language emphasizing the effective lower bound (ELB) as a defining feature of the economic landscape. Instead, it states that our monetary policy strategy is designed to promote maximum employment and stable prices across a broad range of economic conditions. This revision, reflecting a move away from the post\u00e2\u0080\u0093financial crisis era of historically low interest rates, makes our framework more robust. It is useful to recall that at the time of the FOMC's previous framework review, during 2019 and 2020, policymakers were considering an economy that had for many years demonstrated low growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve\u00e2\u0080\u0094meaning that inflation was not very responsive to slack in the economy. The overarching concern for central bankers at that time was how to operate when short-term interest rates are near the ELB. Today, of course, we are operating in a very different environment, at least in part brought on by the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSecond, the revised framework embraces a flexible inflation-targeting approach at all times and eliminates a \"makeup\" strategy that would be employed in certain circumstances. The experience of the U.S. economy since the pandemic highlights different challenges to achieving our inflation mandate\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as supply shocks, sectoral developments, and nonlinear inflation dynamics. The flexible inflation-targeting strategy outlined in our revised framework allows us to take a balanced approach in promoting our goals by considering the extent of departures from them. The revised framework appropriately emphasizes the Committee's commitment to ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.\nThird, the revised consensus statement provides clarity on how the Committee thinks about its legislated goal of maximum employment. The 2020 version of the statement indicated that the Fed would mitigate \"shortfalls\" from maximum employment. This shortfalls strategy was partly motivated by our recognition that real-time assessments of the natural rate of unemployment\u00e2\u0080\u0094and hence of \"maximum employment\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094are highly uncertain. However, the use of the word \"shortfalls\" created some communications challenges, as it was not intended to be a commitment that the Committee would never follow preemptive policy actions or ignore tight labor market conditions. As a result, we have removed it from the consensus statement. Instead, the revised document more precisely states that \"the Committee recognizes that employment may at times run above real-time assessments of maximum employment without necessarily creating risks to price stability.\"\n3\nAs Chair Powell pointed out, preemptive action could well be warranted if tightness in the labor market or other factors pose risks to price stability. The revised statement defines maximum employment as \"the highest level of employment that can be achieved on a sustained basis in a context of price stability.\"\nFourth, and closely aligned with the change I just discussed, the FOMC clarified the approach that it would take to monetary policy in times when the employment and inflation sides of our mandate may be at odds. The revised statement says that, in such periods, the Committee will follow \"a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the extent of departures from its goals and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.\" The revised language more closely aligns with the original 2012 statement. It is also consistent with the Committee's actions during\u00e2\u0080\u00afthe 2022\u00e2\u0080\u009324 period, when the departure from our 2 percent inflation target was the overriding concern.\nI have just highlighted a series of changes that we made to the framework statement, but it is also important to note the\ncontinuity\nwith past versions of our statement. The document continues to explain how we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the policy framework that we believe will best promote maximum employment and price stability. We also continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking and consider the lags in its effects on the economy. We have never set a numerical goal for employment because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to policy. Likewise, we maintained our commitment to a 2 percent inflation objective because that is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, thus supporting both sides of our dual mandate. And we remain committed to conducting a public review roughly every five years.\nConclusion\nThe FOMC remains fully committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate, and the revisions to the framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions. Thank you for allowing me to share with you details of the revised monetary policy framework and my views on the current economic outlook. I hope both will serve as jumping-off points for your discussions over the rest of the afternoon. Once again, I am honored to take part in this inaugural event and look forward to our conversation.\n1.

Jefferson\nAt \"Monetary Policy in the Shadow of Geopolitical Tensions and Trade Conflicts,\" the fourth International Monetary Policy Conference hosted by the Bank of Finland, Helsinki, Finland\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Governor Olli Rehn, for the invitation to visit the lovely city of Helsinki and participate in the Bank of Finland's International Monetary Policy Conference.\n1\nI highly value the opportunity to interact with, and learn from, my fellow central bankers, so thank you again for having me.\nslide 1\nWhen considering the Bank of Finland, the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Federal Reserve in the U.S., it is easy to point out some differences, including our mandates and our economies. But there are also important similarities across these central banks. As independent central banks, our objective is to set policy that will result in the best outcomes for the people we each serve. Another similarity, and one I would like to focus on today, is that both the ECB and the Fed see value in establishing and clearly articulating to the public a framework on how we each approach monetary policymaking. And, in fact, both the ECB and the Fed published revisions to our individual framework documents earlier this year. Such revisions lead to more robust frameworks that help support the mission of central banks across a broad range of economic conditions, including those that are also shaped by geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts, as is the theme of this conference.\nToday, I will briefly\nreview\nsome consistent themes that emerged from the two revised documents. Then, I will discuss in more depth the changes to the Fed's\nStatement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy\n, which Chair Powell announced in his Jackson Hole speech in August. Finally, I will offer my views on the economic outlook and its implications for U.S. monetary policy.\nConsistent Themes\nUnderstanding the work of other central banks and speaking with their policymakers is a healthy exercise. This is particularly true when studying other banks' overarching frameworks. The ECB's Monetary Policy Strategy Statement dates to the central bank's founding in 1998. The Fed is quite a bit older, but it still took us longer to offer a formal framework to the public. The Fed's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy was first issued in 2012, under Chair Ben Bernanke's leadership. At the time, Fed leaders took note that other peer central banks issued public statements of their frameworks and saw value in doing so. While the two documents differ in length and touch on some slightly different topics, reflecting each bank's unique mandate, there are several similarities. One is that the governing bodies of both the ECB and the Fed target 2 percent inflation. Another is that they both have a commitment to revisiting and revising their framework periodically. Also, both revised documents de-emphasized their previous focus on operating near the effective lower bound (ELB) of interest rates in favor of considering a broad range of economic circumstances.\nOverall, both documents describe the central bank's understanding of its monetary policy mandates and its broad approach to achieving them. However, neither is a mandatory policy prescription. Indeed, each framework provides a structure within which its respective policymakers can develop their individual policy views. That is a good thing. It is a sign of a healthy, independent central bank. Robust discussions where alternative viewpoints are considered are more likely to lead to effective policies and better outcomes for the people we serve.\nThe Fed's Revised Framework\nNow, let me turn specifically to the framework document my Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) colleagues and I finished revising in August. The Fed's dual mandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices, which was given to us by the U.S. Congress, underpins the Fed's monetary policy framework. Our commitment to delivering on our dual mandate is unwavering. The revisions to our framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions.\nWe often refer to the framework document as the \"consensus statement.\" We call it that because it reflects the consensus view of the FOMC\u00e2\u0080\u0094and because having a nine-word title for a two-page document is a bit verbose!\nThe FOMC created the revised consensus statement after conducting a public review, the second time the Committee has done so. That review consisted of three elements: first, we held\nFed Listens\nevents around the U.S., where members of the public could share their views with policymakers; second, we hosted an academic research conference that featured presentations from leading experts, including former Chair Bernanke; and third, we convened a series of policymaker discussions and deliberations at FOMC meetings this year, supported by staff analysis.\nThe statement is designed to give the public a clear sense of how we think about monetary policy, and that understanding is important both for transparency and accountability, and for making monetary policy more effective. The changes implemented as a result of this review were a logical progression, not a change in course, grounded in our ever-evolving understanding of our economy. I will make note of\nfour adjustments\nto the consensus statement and discuss each in turn.\nFirst, the revised consensus statement removed language emphasizing the ELB as a defining feature of the economic landscape. Instead, it states that our monetary policy strategy is designed to promote maximum employment and stable prices across a broad range of economic conditions. This revision, reflecting a move away from the post\u00e2\u0080\u0093financial crisis era of historically low interest rates, makes our framework more robust. It is useful to recall that at the time of the FOMC's previous framework review, during 2019 and 2020, policymakers were considering an economy that had for many years demonstrated low growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve\u00e2\u0080\u0094meaning that inflation was not very responsive to slack in the economy.

The flexible inflation targeting in our revised framework allows us to take a balanced approach in promoting our goals, considering the extent of departures from them. The revised framework appropriately emphasizes the Committee's commitment to ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.\nThird, the revised consensus statement provides clarity around how the Committee thinks about maximum employment. The 2020 version of the statement indicated that the Fed would mitigate \"shortfalls\" from maximum employment. The shortfalls strategy grew out of the insight that real-time assessments of the natural rate of unemployment\u00e2\u0080\u0094and hence of \"maximum employment\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094are highly uncertain. However, the use of the word \"shortfalls\" created some communications challenges, as it was not intended to be a commitment to always avoid preemption or to ignore tight labor market conditions. As a result, it was removed from the consensus statement. Instead, the revised document more precisely states that \"the Committee recognizes that employment may at times run above real-time assessments of maximum employment without necessarily creating risks to price stability.\"\n2\nAs Chair Powell pointed out, preemptive action could well be warranted if tightness in the labor market or other factors pose risks to price stability. The revised statement defines maximum employment as \"the highest level of employment that can be achieved on a sustained basis in a context of price stability.\"\n3\nFourth, and closely aligned with the change I just discussed, the FOMC clarified its approach to monetary policy in times when the employment and inflation sides of our mandate may be at odds.

It is also consistent with the Committee's actions during the 2022\u00e2\u0080\u009324 period, when the departure from our 2 percent inflation target was the overriding concern.\nWhile I have highlighted multiple changes, it is also important to note the\ncontinuity\nwith the Fed's past framework statements. The document continues to explain how we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the policy framework that we believe will best promote maximum employment and price stability. We also continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking and consider the lags in its effects on the economy. We have never set a numerical goal for employment because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to policy. Likewise, we maintained our commitment to a 2 percent inflation objective because that is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. And we remain committed to conducting a public review roughly every five years.\nWhile the framework provides a structure through which to think about policy decisions, I will continue to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Consistent with such a determination, I would like to share with you my current outlook for the U.S. economy.\nEconomic Outlook\nRecent data indicate that U.S. economic growth has moderated, and the risks to both sides of our dual mandate have shifted. Employment growth has slowed because of weaker growth in labor supply and a softening in labor demand. The uptick in the unemployment rate suggests that demand has fallen by a bit more than supply and that the downside risks to employment are rising. Meanwhile, higher tariffs are showing through to higher inflation for some goods. I expect that the effects of tariffs on inflation, employment, and economic activity will further show through in coming months.\nThe softening of labor market activity comes as overall economic activity has moderated this year. In the first half of 2025,\nU.S. GDP\ngrew at about a 1.5 percent annual rate, which reflects a marked cooling from last year's 2.5 percent growth rate. The slowdown in economic activity in the first half of this year was primarily driven by weaker consumer spending. That said, U.S. retail spending picked up over the summer. Overall, I expect the U.S. economy to maintain the first half's rate of growth through the remainder of the year.\nIn terms of the labor market, there has been notable slowing in both labor supply and labor demand. Net immigration into the U.S., an important contributor to workforce growth, has dropped sharply. At the same time, total employment growth has slowed. Over the past three months, American employers have added just 29,000\njobs to payrolls\na month on average. The recent pace of employment growth has been the slowest since the U.S. economy recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic recession, which is largely explained by the slower growth in the labor force. There are other measures of the labor market that also bear watching. For example, the\nratio\nof unfilled jobs to unemployed Americans seeking work remains near 1. And measures of job openings and initial jobless claims have been mostly moving sideways.\nA low level of job creation would historically put upward pressure on the\nunemployment rate\n, though so far that effect has been muted because of the decline in labor force growth. The U.S. unemployment rate in August was 4.3 percent, a still relatively low rate, and up just 0.1 percentage point from August of the previous year. The unemployment rate could edge a bit higher this year before moving back down next year.\nTurning to the other side of our dual mandate, it remains notable that inflation has slowed considerably from the highs that occurred when the economy reopened after pandemic disruptions. Inflation, however, remains somewhat above our 2 percent target, and the tariffs that have been announced and implemented so far are showing up in some goods prices. Overall, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August.\nCore PCE inflation\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094which removes volatile food and energy prices\u00e2\u0080\u0094was 2.9 percent in August. Often, it is helpful to study the three major\ncomponents of core PCE inflation\n. Currently, core goods prices have been rising, reflecting tariff effects. In contrast, core services inflation, outside of housing, has generally trended sideways this year, while housing inflation appears to be on a gradual downward trend.\nI view the uncertainty around my baseline outlook as especially high, mainly due to the new policies being introduced by the current U.S. Administration and their effects on employment and inflation. As the changes in these policies are finalized and we have more time to judge how they are affecting the economy, I expect some of the broader uncertainty around the U.S. economy to diminish.\nMonetary Policy\nConsidering the outlook I described, I see the risks to employment as tilted to the downside and risks to inflation to the upside. It follows that both sides of our mandate are under pressure.\nWhile tariff-related inflation is apparent in the prices of some goods, it is also notable that it so far has been lower than what many forecasters predicted this spring. Several factors\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the final tariff rates, the extent of pass-through to consumer prices, the effects on supply chains, overall economic conditions, and what happens to longer-run inflation expectations\u00e2\u0080\u0094will influence the scope and persistence of the related rise in inflation. Short-term inflation expectations have come down from the peaks reached in the second quarter, and most measures of longer-run inflation expectations have been largely stable, suggesting that the American pe",

Waller\nAt Sibos 2025, Frankfurt, Germany\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for inviting me to speak here today.\n1\nThe theme for Sibos this year, \"the next frontiers of global finance\" is a fitting one. We are indeed witnessing a new frontier of innovation in payments and the broader financial system. New technologies like distributed ledgers, tokenized assets, smart contracts, and artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to make payments smarter, faster, and more efficient. I know many of you in the audience today represent firms that are using the latest cutting-edge advances to bring new global solutions to the market.\nThe conference theme also accurately captures that we are at the\nnext\nfrontier. I often note that the modern history of payments is a story of technological innovation.\n2\nThe history spans from the last century, when payments and securities transfers were converted from paper to electronic solutions, to the present day when we increasingly have payment systems that process transactions in real time, 24/7.\nLastly, the conference theme recognizes the global nature of payments and financial infrastructures that underpin international commerce. Of particular focus in this domain are cross-border payments, which involve transactions across a layered and complex set of networks and experience frictions that contribute to higher costs, slower speeds, limited transparency, and barriers to access. Multiple opportunities for improvement exist in international payments, including improvements to smaller-value remittances, business-to-business payments, and collateral management in capital markets.\nAs we enter the next frontier, let us remember that this is not a new story and that we should not fear new technologies, nor new types of providers. Instead, we should ask how new technologies could benefit all types of actors, including the most sophisticated financial firms as well as consumers, while not losing sight of the need for guardrails that promote safety for consumers and the broader financial system. In addition, we should ask how new technologies could be used to upgrade the infrastructures that serve as critical components to the global financial system, in a way that maintains and extends safety and resilience. These are the topics I will consider today.\nChoice and competition\nI approach these issues fundamentally as an economist and as a firm believer in the free market. In particular, I would highlight the importance of choice in how markets function and how competition develops. In general, choices encourage competition, leading to better quality products and services. Businesses innovate to differentiate products, including by incorporating new technical capabilities. This improves market responsiveness to consumer demand. Businesses also incorporate new technologies to compete on cost and efficiency. I see stablecoins, for example, as simply another choice available to consumers and businesses, where they have signaled a need in the market to further improve payments.\n3\nI believe that we must take this articulated need seriously and respect the ability of the private sector to develop solutions.\nThis dynamic is nothing new. Market participants have long had choices in the types of payment instruments they use. Public and private forms of money coexisting, in multiple forms, is in fact a common feature in all developed economies. In the United States, consumers have had central bank money in the form of cash, commercial bank money in the form of deposits in a bank account, and nonbank money (or \"e-money\") in the form of a funds balance on a nonbank payment app. Stablecoins are simply a new form of private money and will exist alongside these other payment instruments, provided consumers accept them as safe, low-risk assets with regulatory protections.\n4\nConsumers and businesses have for decades also had a choice of providers of payment services and financial products including banks, card networks, nonbank payment service providers, and, more recently, other fintechs. Having a choice of providers is important because needs and preferences vary among consumers and businesses. I may choose one provider if I want to park my emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, and I may choose different providers if I want to process a cross-border payment, pay someone with a QR code, or buy a crypto-asset. A choice of providers also encourages competition on cost, speed, efficiency, and user experience.\nAdditionally, firms have options for payments and financial infrastructure, which is important because firms might choose to route money or securities on different rails depending on business needs. Some may value speed; some may prefer the ability to batch payments and settle on net to capture liquidity savings. Some will prefer the features of a centralized financial market infrastructure and its built-in regulatory guardrails; some may prefer to transact on public blockchains, with different models for achieving security and integrity. Having multiple options is also good for public policy objectives like promoting resilience across the broader payment system.\nAssessing benefits of the next frontier of innovations\nGiven this backdrop of new technologies and new entrants within a competitive market, let's explore how this could lead to positive economic outcomes.\nFirst, will the next frontier of innovations translate to lower costs? An influx of new market entrants certainly has the potential to drive down costs as they compete for customers, particularly if blockchain-based transactions prove to be cheaper. If stablecoins present a lower cost alternative to consumers and businesses, I am all for it. We are already seeing this dynamic develop outside of the United States, where U.S. dollar stablecoins are an attractive option in countries in which access to dollar banking services is expensive or limited. We also know that cross-border payments, in particular remittances, are relatively expensive. This is attributable in part to the complexity of transactions involving multiple infrastructures, currencies, and intermediaries. One way in which innovative technologies could translate to lower costs is through efficiency gains.\nThis brings me to my second question: how might new technologies improve the efficiency of the payment system? Distributed ledger technology, or DLT, is rapidly becoming an efficient infrastructure for 24/7 transactions, recordkeeping, and data management by enabling multiple platforms, parties, assets, and functions to be combined in new ways. As an example, DLT-based platforms can support 24/7 real-time payments and securities transfers by using programmable functionalities like smart contracts to enhance operational efficiency and automate more complex financial transactions. With the ability to specify the precise time at which a transaction settles and under what conditions, DLT-based platforms have the potential to increase the flexibility and efficiency of settlement for money and assets.\nMany cross-border payments today rely on the correspondent banking model\u00e2\u0080\u0094a network of bilateral banking relationships that enables financial institutions to access foreign financial systems and to conduct business across jurisdictions without establishing physical and legal presence in every market they serve. While correspondent banking has been the backbone of global payments for decades, this model faces several challenges, including high transaction costs, slower processing times, and a global decline in correspondent banking relationships. While these frictions are attributed in part to the process of sending payments through a complex chain of correspondent banks, I should note that not all frictions are barriers to overcome. Certain frictions are purposely built into the global payment system for compliance and risk-management reasons, such as preventing money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.\n5\nDLT-based platforms have the potential to improve upon the existing correspondent banking model, and private-sector firms are pursuing multiple approaches to do so. One way is through the \"stablecoin sandwich\" model, in which fiat currency in one country is converted first into a stablecoin, then that stablecoin is transferred to another individual, and then converted back into the local fiat currency at its destination. Another way is through the use of tokenized deposits, where banks represent deposit liabilities on a blockchain for wholesale and cross-border transactions. Either model has the potential to improve transparency, cost, and timeliness, while balancing the need for safety and integrity of the transfer. DLT-based platforms generally (and stablecoins, specifically) may also present opportunities for efficiency gains in remittance payments, where today, money transfer operators rely on large global networks of agents and pre-position capital in various currencies to pay out customers in different jurisdictions. These examples also demonstrate that innovation is not an issue of \"TradFi\" versus \"DeFi,\" but rather poses an opportunity to harness the complementary strengths each has to offer, especially at a time where we are seeing increased convergence between the two.\nImportantly, efficiency will depend on the extent to which DLT networks can interoperate with one another and with traditional payment rails. This is particularly true because payments exhibit significant network effects. Fortunately, numerous private-sector advances in interoperability are emerging given this market need, and as an operator of core payment and settlement infrastructure, we at the Federal Reserve continue to assess how we can improve our existing rails that serve private-sector firms.\nLet's turn from DLT to AI. AI can further improve the efficiency of payments in a number of ways, including through automating manual tasks, detecting fraud or compliance risks, and now with agentic AI, executing tasks on behalf of a person or company quickly and cheaply through the use of AI agents.\n6\nLet's again take the example of cross-border payments, which involve multiple jurisdictions, each with its own compliance requirements. Firms are increasingly exploring AI and machine learning (as well as smart contracts) to automate compliance activities.\nThird, can new technologies and products maintain and build trust in the digital ecosystem? I believe they can. One common criticism of stablecoins is that they will somehow undermine the trust in money. Under regulatory frameworks like the GENIUS Act in the United States, payment stablecoins will be backed at least 1 to 1 with safe, liquid assets and users will be able to redeem their stablecoins at par. I have long advocated that a right-sized regulatory framework can address concerns related to safety and financial stability, while allowing stablecoins to scale on their own merits.\n7\nAs with any technology, ecosystem operators will need to assess and manage risks, including cybersecurity. As payments shift to new rails and include stablecoins, tokenized assets, and smart contracts, new opportunities for cyberattacks will emerge. Achieving security and resilience means ensuring these digital platforms are hardened against misuse, with redundancy and safeguards in place that match the scale of domestic and global payments. Building resilience requires both the private and public sectors to work together on standards, cybersecurity, and risk management, so that innovation goes hand-in-hand with safety.\nRoles of the private and public sectors\nThis brings me to the roles that the private and public sectors can play at the next frontier of payments innovation. I often argue that the private sector can most reliably and efficiently allocate resources and take risks to explore the value of new technologies.\n8\nThe private sector is also best positioned to serve consumers and provide products and services that meet their needs. You don't want the government to decide what technologies are in or out, or decide what consumers want. Further, the private sector brings a depth and level of technical expertise required to translate new technologies into practical improvements for payments.\nThe role of the public sector is to support the private sector in specific circumstances where that is useful. At the Federal Reserve, that means serving as a convener to solve coordination problems, providing regulatory clarity when within our specific remit, and operating core payment and settlement infrastructure that the private sector uses. Complementary private and public roles can contribute to a safe and efficient payment system.\nLooking ahead, I believe it is important to understand how the Federal Reserve can continue to support private-sector innovation. One way is to conduct research and experimentation on emerging technologies. At the Federal Reserve, we are conducting hands-on research on the latest wave of innovations, including tokenization, smart contracts, and AI in payments. We do this to understand how private-sector innovators will use these to improve payments, as well as identify any opportunities to upgrade our own payment infrastructures.\nAnother way is to engage actively with industry on innovations. That is why, in three weeks, I am convening industry leaders and U.S. policymakers to discuss how to further improve the payment system. That is also why I appreciate coming to events like Sibos, where industry experts within the private sector engage with public-sector officials to discuss how we can best navigate the next frontier of innovations.

Bowman\nAt the Forecasters Club of New York Luncheon, New York, New York\nShare\nGood afternoon. Thank you for the invitation to speak to you. I am delighted to have the opportunity to address this distinguished group of macroeconomic forecasters. Today I will discuss how I approach monetary policy decisionmaking, and I will then describe some of the challenges we will likely face in the years ahead.\n1\nBefore turning to the main topic of my remarks, I would like to provide some context about my background and how that shapes my approach to my role as a policymaker. After serving for nearly seven years on the Board of Governors, earlier this year, the President appointed me as the Federal Reserve's Vice Chair for Supervision. My role as a financial regulator and my previous experience as a state bank regulator and community banker in Kansas give me a unique perspective on how to approach my responsibilities as a monetary policymaker. This experience informs how I think about economic conditions and the balance of risks to economic activity, the labor market, and inflation in assessing the appropriate stance and direction of policy.\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy to support a strong and stable economy that works for all Americans. In doing so, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) conducts its responsibilities according to the congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability. The Fed pursues these goals by adjusting its monetary policy stance using a variety of tools, including setting interest rates, providing forward guidance about the expected future path of policy, and adjusting the size and composition of our balance sheet. Our primary monetary policy tool is the federal funds rate, a key interest rate for overnight borrowing by commercial banks that influences other interest rates throughout financial markets. Lower interest rates tend to stimulate demand\u00e2\u0080\u0094for housing, cars and other durable goods, and for business investment\u00e2\u0080\u0094which boosts economic activity and has the potential to push up inflation. Higher interest rates tend to slow the economy and tend to push inflation down.\nAchieving both of these goals is challenging when they are in tension. Policy actions to tame inflation, like raising the target range for the federal funds rate, can have an adverse effect on employment. By contrast, policy actions aimed at supporting employment that is below its maximum level can potentially increase risks to price stability. These are just a few of the challenges we face as policymakers. With that background, I will share more on my approach to our monetary policy responsibilities and the use of our existing toolkit. I consider my approach in terms of flexibility in shifting the focus on policy objectives when needed and a limited footprint in financial markets.\nA Flexible Approach to Policymaking\nPursuing the objectives of the dual mandate at the same time means that we generally seek to achieve the maximum level of employment that is consistent with price stability. But the monetary policy objectives are not always complementary. Because our dual mandate places equal weight on both maximum employment and price stability, when these objectives are in tension it is important not to favor one side of the mandate over the other. In that circumstance, we should be flexible and direct our focus to the side of the mandate that deviates the most from its goal or that shows the greater risk of persistently departing from it. Hesitating to address existing or emerging departures from the dual-mandate goals, due to self-limitations stemming from an unwillingness to depart from outdated past policy communication, increases the likelihood that policymakers will need to implement abrupt and large policy corrections.\nAs we all remember in 2021, supply and demand imbalances, amplified by extraordinary stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies, led to a sharp rise in inflation over just a few months. By the second half of that year, amid growing inflationary pressures, it became clear that our monetary policy stance was too accommodative and that the FOMC needed to move toward a tighter policy stance. On a 12-month basis, total consumer price index (CPI) inflation rose from about 1-1/2 percent in early 2021 to about 9 percent in mid-2022. We began increasing the policy rate at the March 2022 FOMC meeting, when reported CPI inflation was already at about 8 percent and core personal consumption expenditures inflation was above 5 percent.\nIn my view, the accommodative forward guidance the Committee adopted in the September and the December 2020 postmeeting statements, which put more weight on the employment side of our mandate, pushed the mandated goals out of balance and contributed to the delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021.\n2\nThat forward guidance made it much more difficult for the FOMC to react to new information suggesting that risks and uncertainties had evolved in response to pandemic-related changes in the economy. This ultimately restricted our ability to respond to rising inflationary pressures before seeing any progress on the labor market. Ultimately, delaying taking appropriate action while inflation started to increase left us in a position in which we needed to course correct and catch up by raising the policy rate in large increments over a number of months.\nRecognizing the substantial risk that unacceptably high inflation could persist, and once the conditions in the labor market were moving toward the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, by the end of 2021 I shifted my focus to the inflation side of our mandate and to bringing inflation down toward our 2 percent goal. At the time, I argued in favor of taking prompt and forceful policy action to get inflation under control, which I saw as our primary responsibility at that time, as it had begun to impose a heavy burden on households and businesses. Of course, tightening policy and then maintaining a restrictive stance to lower inflation could have resulted in costs and risks to the labor market, but I saw far greater costs and risks in allowing inflation to persist. And, importantly, maintaining the commitment to restoring price stability is the best course to sustain a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone.\nAs I noted in recent remarks, we are now facing a very different economic environment.\n3\nOver the past several months, I have been pointing to a shift in economic conditions and in the balance of risks to our employment and inflation goals, calling attention to signs of potential labor market fragility. And I have argued that increasing signs of weakening labor market conditions provide a basis for proactively supporting the employment side of our mandate.\nRecent data show a materially more fragile labor market along with inflation that, excluding tariffs, has continued to hover not far above our target. Given this shift in labor market conditions, at last week's FOMC meeting I supported beginning the process of removing policy restraint and bringing the federal funds rate back to its neutral level.\nUp until the July FOMC meeting, even with inflation within range of our target, the Committee has focused primarily on the inflation side of the dual mandate. Now that we have seen many months of deteriorating labor market conditions, it is time for the Committee to act decisively and proactively to address decreasing labor market dynamism and emerging signs of fragility. In my view, the recent data, including the estimated payroll employment benchmark revisions, show that we are at serious risk of already being behind the curve in addressing deteriorating labor market conditions. Should these conditions continue, I am concerned that we will need to adjust policy at a faster pace and to a larger degree going forward.\nI recognize and appreciate concerns that we have not yet perfectly achieved our inflation goal. But under a flexible approach to policymaking, it is appropriate to focus on the side of the mandate that is showing signs of deterioration or fragility even though inflation is above but within range of our target. This shift is appropriate now because forecasters widely expect inflation to significantly decline next year, and as further deterioration in labor market conditions would likely lead to more persistent damage to the employment side of the mandate, that would be difficult to address with our tools.\nWith tariff-related price increases likely being a one-time effect, my view is that inflation will return to 2 percent after these effects dissipate. Because changes in monetary policy take time to work their way through the economy, it is appropriate to look through temporarily elevated inflation readings and therefore remove some policy restraint to avoid weakening in the labor market, provided that long-run inflation expectations remain well anchored.\nIn addition, putting tariffs aside, the U.S. economy may also be experiencing an extended productivity surge, in large part because of recent technological advances. And productivity growth has likely been higher than reported due to the downward benchmark revisions to payroll gains. These developments reinforce the case for removing policy restraint because monetary policy should accommodate productivity shocks that raise potential output.\nIn light of all these considerations, in my view, it was appropriate to begin the process of moving policy toward a more neutral stance at last week's FOMC meeting, and it has been appropriate to do so for several months. Moreover, the rising downside risks to employment and the potential for greater damage to the labor market underscore the need to shift our focus away from overemphasizing the latest data points.\nIn the past, I have supported data dependence as an approach that incorporates incoming data into the decisions that lie immediately ahead and further into the future. Our experience during and following the pandemic highlights the difficulty in assessing the current state of the economy and predicting how it will evolve in the presence of major supply- and demand-side shocks, possible structural changes in the economy, and real-time data and measurement uncertainty. With unusually high uncertainty around the state of the economy and the economic outlook, and with significant risks to our employment and price stability goals, judging where the economy is headed in the future is much more challenging. Therefore, it made sense in the past to consider and be informed by the incoming data and its implications for the outlook in assessing the appropriate path for monetary policy.\nBut today we are facing different conditions. I am concerned that the labor market could enter into a precarious phase, and there is a risk that a shock could tip it into a sudden and significant deterioration. An inflexible and dogmatic view of data dependence gives an inherently backward-looking view of the economy and would guarantee that we remain behind the curve, requiring us to catch up in the future.\nI think we should consider shifting our focus from overweighting the latest data points to a proactive forward-looking approach and making a forecast that reflects how the economy is likely to evolve going forward. Because policy actions take time to flow through to, or have their full effect on, the economy, labor markets, and inflation, it is important that we are making predictions about where the economy is headed and to act on those forecasts in real time. A forward-looking approach ensures that monetary policy can help support the economy. It also better positions us to avoid falling behind the curve and then having to implement abrupt and dramatic policy actions. In my view, it is more effective to act promptly and decisively in the face of fragility than to be forced to dramatically adjust policy after damage has occurred.\nA Limited Footprint \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the Fed's Balance Sheet\nI will turn now to discuss my views about how we use our balance sheet. As the runoff in our securities portfolio proceeds following extensive asset purchases during the pandemic, there are several issues with important implications regarding the size and the composition of the Fed's balance sheet in the longer run.\nOver the longer run, my preference is to maintain the smallest balance sheet possible with reserve balances at a level closer to scarce than ample. First, a smaller balance sheet would minimize the Fed's footprint in money markets and in Treasury markets. Of course, in order to efficiently implement monetary policy, it is necessary to have some footprint in these markets. Second, holding less-than-ample reserves would return us to a place where we are actively managing our balance sheet, identifying instead of masking signals of market stress. In my view, actively managing our balance sheet would give a more timely indication of stress and market functioning issues, as allowing a modest amount of volatility in money markets can enhance our understanding of market clearing points.\nLower levels of reserves may also incentivize banks to engage in more active management of their liquidity positions and liquidity risks. Finally, a lower terminal level of reserves and a smaller balance sheet as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) would provide the FOMC with the optionality to respond to future shocks or economic downturns without worrying whether there is enough room to expand the balance sheet as a potential tool.\nIn terms of the composition of the Fed's securities holdings in the longer run, I strongly support having a System Open Market Account portfolio that consists only of Treasury securities to minimize the effects of the Federal Reserve's holdings on the allocation of credit across the economy. Holding agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), or other non-Treasury securities, could be seen as selective credit allocation.\nI also look forward to revisiting the Committee's consideration of potential sales of our agency MBS holdings. Simply relying on MBS runoff will not allow returning to a Treasury-only portfolio within a credible time frame.\nThe longer-run maturity structure of the Federal Reserve's Treasury securities holdings is also an important consideration. One benefit of a Treasury portfolio maturity structure that mirrors the broader Treasury market is that the Fed's holdings would be \"neutral.\" This means that these holdings would not disproportionately affect the pricing of any given maturity of Treasury security or provide incentives for the issuance of any given type of Treasury security.

Barr\nAt the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you.\n1\nToday, I would like to discuss a vital tool for supervising the safety and soundness of the largest banks and preserving the stability of our financial system. I was there, at the Treasury Department in 2009, when stress testing was first used in the United States in the heat of battle, an ad hoc measure to reverse a loss of confidence in U.S. banks that was a major force then driving the Great Recession. By examining how the balance sheets of banks would be affected by a worsening of financial and economic conditions, this process was intended to reveal weaknesses that could threaten the solvency of banks and prevent them from playing their central role in the economy.\n2\nStress testing ultimately succeeded in helping to restore confidence during the crisis, and in the aftermath this battle-tested tool became a formal and integral part of the effort to repair the ensuing damage and strengthen the banking system. Stress testing has continued to evolve in the years since then to maintain that strength and help limit the chances of another devastating financial crisis. Stress testing changed as its purpose changed from wartime to peacetime\u00e2\u0080\u0094from mitigating the crisis to preserving safety, soundness, and stability. It has changed as banks and regulators learned more about how stress testing works in practice and as part of an otherwise evolving supervisory and regulatory framework for banks that must necessarily adjust as finance itself evolves.\nAdjusting regulation in this dynamic environment is challenging, and one of those challenges is dealing with unintended consequences. The Federal Reserve made changes to stress testing in 2020 intended to make it more predictable and to better integrate it with overall capital regulation, but those changes are now at the center of litigation brought by large banks. The Fed responded in April by proposing more changes intended to address these criticisms. But as I explained in voting against those measures, I believe these steps will substantially impair stress testing, concealing rather than revealing crucial weaknesses in the risk management of individual banks and in the stability of the financial system.\n3\nAs the Federal Reserve Board considers these changes, I believe we should focus on how best to address the original purpose\u00e2\u0080\u0094and preserve the effectiveness\u00e2\u0080\u0094of stress testing. As I will explain, I believe that the best way to further these goals is to separate stress testing from capital requirements in order to maximize the informative value of the tests and their results and untangle them from the larger and complex task of setting capital requirements. I will lay out that alternative approach toward the end of these remarks, but first I believe it is helpful to take a step back and recall how stress testing has evolved to this point, then turn to where it should go from here.\nIt all began during the Global Financial Crisis. Capital markets froze, resulting in business failures and prompting the need for unprecedented public-sector intervention. Credit to households and businesses slowed to a trickle, and millions of people were losing homes and jobs. By the fall of 2008, there was a broad-based lack of confidence in the banking system, as large banks faced questions about their exposures to losses related to real estate and other assets. These were questions that large banks in many cases couldn't credibly answer because of the complexity and opacity of their direct and indirect exposures to mortgages at the center of the crisis. Without this information, investors assumed the worst, driving down equity prices of banks, which complicated efforts by banks to bolster their balance sheets.\nRestoring confidence in the banking system required credible information from a reliable source. Treasury worked with the Federal Reserve to design the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) to test the capital adequacy of what were determined to be the 19 most systemically important banking and financial institutions. In addition, Congress had provided a backstop in the form of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) had backstopped bank funding through guarantees, and the Federal Reserve had stepped up in significant ways to bolster the financial system and the economy. The existence of a government backstop played a big role in the success of the first stress test. With the use of public funding on the line, the rigor and transparency of the stress test was doubly important.\n4\nRebuilding Confidence in the Largest Banks\nThere were five aspects of the SCAP that are elemental to stress testing and have been present in the different tests since then.\nFirst, there was the use of a severe but plausible scenario for macroeconomic conditions. The scenario assumed a deeper and more prolonged recession than forecasters expected. Because of the focus on housing-related losses, the scenario's assumption of a further severe decline in housing prices was essential to rebuilding confidence.\nSecond, there was the use of economic models to translate a given scenario into quantified losses for each bank. The banking regulators worked together to develop models to map the stress scenario into a range of associated loss rates for different loan categories and iterated with the banks to assess their specific exposures.\nThird, based on the extent of those projected losses, the test arrived at a firm-specific amount of capital that each bank would need in order to withstand this stress and keep lending to customers.\nA fourth aspect of the SCAP and subsequent stress tests was the public disclosure of the scenario, the basic testing methodology, and, most importantly, firm-specific results.\nAnd lastly, in addition to the balance sheet data and other numbers related to the stress test, the Federal Reserve produced a qualitative supervisory assessment of the banks' capital planning decisions and processes.\nOne essential element of that first test is that the supervisors reviewed and assessed the data and modeling assumptions used by the banks, which helped to provide credibility for the loss estimates. The result of the SCAP was that 10 of the 19 tested institutions were required to raise capital sufficient to keep them above regulatory minimums if the scenario were to materialize\u00e2\u0080\u0094a total of $75 billion. The 10 were given six months to develop capital plans to meet their stress test minimums.\nThe SCAP was remarkably successful. There was skepticism that the test would be sufficiently severe or transparent to be credible, and bank stock prices were volatile due to speculation about what the stress test results would reveal. But bank stocks recovered after the results were announced in May. Most banks that had been struggling to raise capital were able to do so, with 9 of the 10 able to find private sector sources of funding by the six-month deadline.\n5\nCredit default swaps for large banks returned to levels seen before the acute stage of the crisis.\n6\nBank lending was slower to recover, but stabilizing the banks helped stop the crisis and the U.S. economy started the long process of recovery that July.\nSupporting the Resilience of the Largest Banks\nI have compared the SCAP to a battlefield campaign, and while the financial crisis certainly felt like combat at the time, my point is to emphasize the unique challenge of making financial regulatory policy in an emergency. The goal was to restore public trust in banks that were under fire, and as the job shifted to preserving that trust, it was apparent that there should be an ongoing role for stress testing in peacetime as well. Starting with the yearly stress test established in 2010 with the Dodd-Frank Act and continuing with the integration of stress testing into the Federal Reserve's annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the peacetime approach focused on institutionalizing bank resilience and risk-management practices. The Federal Reserve Board conducted the first CCAR exercise in 2011. CCAR was an overall assessment of the capital planning processes of banks, which included quantitative and qualitative components. Either of those components could form the basis for an objection by the Fed to firm plans to distribute capital to shareholders, distribution which would reduce the capital available that the firm could use to buffer its losses.\nThe quantitative evaluation of a firm's capital adequacy was driven by the results of the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test, or DFAST.\n7\nIt departed from the SCAP in at least two important ways. First, rather than making the severe scenario just a more negative version of the current consensus forecast, the Fed built a process to develop thematic forward-looking scenarios using macroeconomic models calibrated to historical data.\n8\nSome parts of the scenario design framework are purposely countercyclical under normal conditions\u00e2\u0080\u0094for instance, the minimum peak unemployment rate is set at 10 percent. The countercyclicality of stress test scenarios is an attempt to lean against pro-cyclical effects that can make borrowers appear overly resilient in good times, something which could cause the model to significantly understate the magnitude of borrower defaults when the economy turns.\n9\nThe second way that the Dodd-Frank stress test departed from CCAR is that most losses under DFAST are projected by applying models developed and operated by the Federal Reserve based on data provided by the banks. Using Fed-developed and validated models provides for independent risk assessments. The granular data provided by banks has been valuable in ensuring that the stress tests are truly risk sensitive and in understanding broader trends and interconnections in the financial system.\nIn addition to this quantitative test, CCAR assesses the ability of banks to determine their capital needs in the future. Supplementing the DFAST model administered by the Fed, each bank projects its income over the stress scenario using its internal models, providing supervisors with a view of governance and risk management of the bank's capital planning process. If a bank did not pass either the quantitative or qualitative evaluation, the Board of Governors was able to object to the capital plan and restrict the firm's shareholder distributions.\nOver time, several criticisms of CCAR's approach emerged. The first was that CCAR was wholly separate from the process used to set a bank's basic, risk-based capital requirements. Large banks also criticized CCAR for a lack of transparency and predictability that resulted in them pre-committing to lower capital distributions and higher levels of capital.\nIn 2020, the Federal Reserve Board addressed these bank criticisms by creating the stress capital buffer (SCB). To address the criticism that CCAR was additive and wasn't integrated into capital planning, the SCB combined the basic capital requirement for banks with one equal to a bank's projected capital ratio decline during the stress test plus a year's worth of planned dividends, linking components of the capital framework. To address the claim that CCAR lacked transparency and predictability, the SCB requirement was set for each participating bank at a level that reflected its losses in the stress test and provided banks with flexibility to change their dividends in real time.\n10\nAnother bank criticism was that CCAR's use of a qualitative assessment was subjective. The SCB dropped the qualitative objection and recast the assessment of capital planning practices as a traditional supervisory exam.\nBy more directly integrating stress testing into capital regulation, the SCB increasingly moved stress testing away from supervision and toward the regulatory arena, a consequential decision. While this change was intended to promote consistency and predictability, in retrospect, it may have reduced some of the value of the exercise, in that it reduced the range of facts and circumstances the Board would take into account when evaluating an individual firm's capital adequacy. As a result, the Board's flexibility to adjust capital adequacy determinations based on the unique features of different firms, including different business models and risk profiles, was constrained.\nWhen I became Vice Chair for Supervision in 2022, we continued the process of evolving the stress test as necessary. In particular, the Fed conducted multiple scenarios not directly connected to setting banks' capital requirements.\n11\nUsing additional scenarios has helped us to understand how a broader range of risks might affect the banking system. For example, we've explored a stagflation scenario and looked at the failures of large non-bank counterparties. Using multiple scenarios has helped to keep our risk-assessments dynamic.\nBenefits and Effects of the Current Stress Testing Framework\nBefore turning to the legal challenges of the current stress test framework, I would be remiss not to emphasize the value of that framework. The stress test has been a critical element that led to strengthening both the quantity of capital in the banking system and the risk-management capabilities of large banks.\nSince the Global Financial Crisis, large banks have more than doubled their risk-based common equity capital ratios\u00e2\u0080\u0094from roughly 5 percent to 12 percent or more. At the same time, they have made meaningful improvements in their ability to measure, monitor, and manage their own risks. The stress test has directly contributed to both.\nDespite this success, some have argued for what they term \"full transparency\" of the test. But the criticism can be misleading because two important points are often omitted. First, the Federal Reserve already provides substantial information about the design of the test and has expanded those disclosures over time. Banks are far from uninformed. They receive substantial information about the models in annual model methodology disclosures.\n12\nAny material model changes are phased in over two years, with full explanation. Second, what critics call \"transparency\" is not disclosure of basic information about the rigor and methodology of the test essential for its credibility; instead, it is the equivalent of handing out the questions to the test in advance. That would fundamentally undermine the rigor of the test, which is intended to assess resilience under conditions not fully known in advance, just as in a financial crisis.\nIn short, the framework strikes a deliberate balance: providing banks with enough information",

Powell\nAt the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce 2025 Economic Outlook Luncheon, Warwick, Rhode Island\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you. It is a pleasure to be back here in Rhode Island. The last time I had the opportunity to speak to the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce was in the fall of 2019. I noted then that, \"if the outlook changes materially, policy will change as well.\"\n1\nLittle did any of us know! Just a couple of months later, the COVID-19 pandemic arrived. Both the economy and our policy evolved dramatically in ways no one could have predicted. Along with actions by Congress, the Administration, and the private sector, the Fed's aggressive response helped stave off historically severe downside risks to the economy.\nThe COVID pandemic came on the heels of the painfully slow decade-long recovery from the Global Financial Crisis. These two back-to-back world historical crises have left behind scars that will be with us for a long time. In democracies around the world, public trust in economic and political institutions has been challenged. Those of us who are in public service at this time need to focus tightly on carrying out our critical missions to the best of our ability in the midst of stormy seas and powerful crosswinds.\nThroughout this turbulent period, central banks like the Fed have had to develop innovative new policies that were designed to deliver on our statutory goals during times of crisis, rather than for everyday use. Despite these two unique, extremely large shocks, the U.S. economy has performed as well or better than other large, advanced economies around the world. As always, it is essential that we continue to look back and learn the right lessons from these difficult years, and that process has been ongoing for more than a decade.\nTurning to the present day, the U.S. economy is showing resilience in the midst of substantial changes in trade and immigration policies, as well as in fiscal, regulatory and geopolitical arenas. These policies are still emerging, and their longer-term implications will take some time to be seen.\nEconomic Outlook\nRecent data show that the pace of economic growth has moderated. The unemployment rate is low but has edged up. Job gains have slowed, and the downside risks to employment have risen. At the same time, inflation has risen recently and remains somewhat elevated. In recent months, it has become clear that the balance of risks has shifted, prompting us to move our policy stance closer to neutral at our meeting last week.\nGDP rose at a pace of around one and a half percent in the first half of the year, down from 2.5 percent growth last year. The moderation in growth largely reflects a slowdown in consumer spending. Activity in the housing sector remains weak, but business investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from last year's pace. As noted in the September Beige Book, a report that gathers qualitative information from across the Fed System, businesses continue to say that uncertainty is weighing on their outlook. Measures of consumer and business sentiment declined sharply in the spring; they have since moved up but remain low relative to the start of the year.\nIn the labor market, there has been a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers\u00e2\u0080\u0094an unusual and challenging development. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment have risen. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.3 percent in August but has remained relatively stable at a low level over the past year. Payroll job gains slowed sharply over the summer months, as employers added an average of just 29,000 per month over the past three months. The recent pace of job creation appears to be running below the \"breakeven\" rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. But a number of other labor market indicators remain broadly stable. For example, the ratio of job openings to unemployment remains near 1. And multiple measures of job openings have been moving roughly sideways, as have initial claims for unemployment insurance.\nInflation has eased significantly from its highs of 2022 but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. The latest available data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August, up from 2.3 percent in August 2024. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent last month, also higher than the year-ago level. Goods prices, after falling last year, are driving the pickup in inflation. Incoming data and surveys suggest that those price increases largely reflect higher tariffs rather than broader price pressures. Disinflation for services continues, including for housing. Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, on balance, over the course of this year on news about tariffs. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.\nThe overall economic effects of the significant changes in trade, immigration, fiscal and regulatory policy remain to be seen. A reasonable base case is that the tariff-related effects on inflation will be relatively short lived\u00e2\u0080\u0094a one-time shift in the price level. A \"one-time\" increase does not mean \"all at once.\" Tariff increases will likely take some time to work their way through supply chains. As a result, this one-time increase in the price level will likely be spread over several quarters and show up as somewhat higher inflation during that period.\nBut uncertainty around the path of inflation remains high. We will carefully assess and manage the risk of higher and more persistent inflation. We will make sure that this one-time increase in prices does not become an ongoing inflation problem.\nMonetary Policy\nNear-term risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside\u00e2\u0080\u0094a challenging situation. Two-sided risks mean that there is no risk-free path. If we ease too aggressively, we could leave the inflation job unfinished and need to reverse course later to fully restore 2 percent inflation. If we maintain restrictive policy too long, the labor market could soften unnecessarily. When our goals are in tension like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate.\nThe increased downside risks to employment have shifted the balance of risks to achieving our goals. We therefore judged it appropriate at our last meeting to take another step toward a more neutral policy stance, lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4 to 4-1/4 percent. This policy stance, which I see as still modestly restrictive, leaves us well positioned to respond to potential economic developments.\nOur policy is not on a preset course. We will continue to determine the appropriate stance based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment and bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.\nThank you again for having me here. I look forward to our discussion.\n1. See Jerome H.

Bowman\nAt the 2025 Kentucky Bankers Association Annual Convention, Asheville, North Carolina\nShare\nGood morning.\n1\nI would like to thank the Kentucky Bankers Association for the opportunity to join you again for your annual convention, this time with an important difference. Earlier this year, the President nominated, and the Senate confirmed, me as the Fed's Vice Chair for Supervision. It's the first time someone with community banking experience has served in this role, and I am working to make sure that the Federal Reserve is addressing the issues I have discussed with you and other community bankers over the past nearly seven years that I've been a member of the Board of Governors.\nIt is really a pleasure to be with you again, and especially in Asheville, North Carolina, after the terrible flooding this area experienced last year.\nSince the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met for our September meeting last week, I thought I would share my views on the U.S. economy and monetary policy, including on my policy vote.\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting\nAt last week's FOMC meeting, the Committee voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, bringing it to 4 to 4-1/4 percent, and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. In my view, the Committee should have begun lowering the policy rate at the July meeting, so, of course, I supported reducing the policy rate at this meeting.\nFor several months, I have been pointing out signs of potential labor market fragility. Since the June FOMC meeting and in public remarks following that meeting, I have argued that increasing signs of weakening labor market conditions provide a basis for beginning to move the policy rate closer to neutral to proactively support the employment side of our mandate. Recent data have revealed a materially more fragile labor market along with inflation that, excluding tariffs, has continued to hover not far above our target. Given this shift in labor market conditions, I am pleased that we have finally begun the process of removing policy restraint, reflecting the economic conditions and the balance of risks to our employment and inflation goals. Assuming the economy evolves as I expect, last week's action should be the first step to bring the federal funds rate back to its neutral level.\nEconomic Conditions and Outlook\nThe U.S. economy has been resilient, but I am concerned about the weakening in labor market conditions and softer economic growth. I am also more confident that, as trade policy has become more certain, tariffs will have only a small and short-lived effect on inflation going forward.\nGDP growth slowed to a modest pace in the first half of the year, as consumer spending softened and both investment in residential and commercial real estate and federal government purchases declined. A surge in high-tech investment, likely related to interest-rate-insensitive AI and data-center projects, accounted for at least half of the increased demand in the first six months of the year, while there was weakness in other categories. The incoming data for July and August point to an improvement in third-quarter consumer expenditures.\nDeclines in housing activity, including single-family home construction and sales, have been accompanied by higher inventories of homes for sale and falling house prices, suggesting that housing demand has also weakened. Elevated mortgage rates may be exerting a more persistent drag as income growth expectations have declined while house prices remain high relative to rents. Given very low housing affordability, existing home sales have remained depressed since 2023 and at levels only comparable with the early 2010s following the financial crisis. I am concerned that, in the current environment, declines in house prices could accelerate, posing downside risks to housing valuations, construction, and inflation.\nTurning to the labor market, conditions have weakened this year as shown by the rise in the unemployment rate and essentially flat payroll employment, which rose only about 25,000 per month since April. This is down sharply from the moderate pace of job gains seen earlier in the year and well below estimates of breakeven rates, due to softening in labor demand. The unemployment rate moved up to 4.3 percent in August, largely reflecting reduced hiring as businesses continue to retain existing workers instead of increasing layoffs. Wage growth has slowed closer to a pace consistent with 2 percent inflation, indicating that the labor market is no longer a source of inflation pressures.\nAlthough still near full employment, the labor market has become more fragile and could deteriorate more significantly in the coming months. The unemployment rate has increased notably among groups that tend to be more affected by the business cycle, including teenagers. And the employment-to-population ratio has dropped significantly this year, showing more softening than the unemployment rate implies. Layoffs have edged up from low levels and could rise quickly if the economy weakens further since hiring rates have remained low. One consequence of a less dynamic labor market this year is the significant increase in the number of long-term unemployed workers.\nPayroll employment growth has been concentrated in just a few services industries that tend to be less affected by the business cycle, with healthcare, social services, and leisure and hospitality more than accounting for all job gains since April. The share of industries with positive job growth over the last six months dropped below 50 percent in August to a historically low level.\nActual payroll employment may have started to fall in recent months given the sizable upward bias in the published data implied by the Q1 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages report. Although less immigration likely explains some of the slower payroll gains and economic growth this year, immigration does not fully explain the slowing. The surge in immigration likely boosted the rise in unemployment through mid-2024, and lower immigration may now be masking a steeper rise in unemployment this year. In addition, these immigrants likely make a smaller contribution to economic activity than the average U.S. worker, as they tend to work in jobs and industries with lower wages and lower productivity.\n2\nOn price stability, we have seen some progress in lowering inflation, excluding one-off tariff effects on goods prices. Based on the latest consumer and producer price reports, 12\u00e2\u0080\u0091month core PCE inflation likely stood at 2.9 percent in August. However, after removing estimated tariff effects, core PCE inflation has hovered around 2.5 percent in recent months, which is significant progress and within range of our target. This progress reflects a considerable slowing in core services inflation, which is consistent with recent softness in consumer spending and the labor market no longer being a source of inflation pressures.\nThe underlying trend in core PCE inflation appears to be moving much closer to our 2 percent target than is currently shown in the data. With housing services inflation on a sustained downward trajectory, and further progress on other categories within core services inflation, only core goods inflation remains elevated, likely reflecting limited pass-through from tariffs.\nIn terms of risks to achieving our dual mandate, as I gain even greater confidence that tariffs will not present a persistent shock to inflation, I see that upside risks to price stability have diminished. With softness in aggregate demand, and signs of fragility in the labor market, I think that we should focus on risks to our employment mandate and preemptively stabilize and support labor market conditions.\nMemories of pandemic worker shortages are still fresh, and businesses have so far chosen to maintain, rather than to reduce, their workforce in response to the slowing economic conditions. They also seem to be more willing to reduce profit margins as they are less able to fully pass through higher costs and raise prices given the weakness in demand. If demand conditions do not improve, businesses may need to begin to lay off workers, recognizing that it will not be as difficult to rehire given the shift in labor market conditions.\nOn trade policy, foreign suppliers are absorbing some of the new tariffs, and importers are shifting to lower-tariffed sources. Slack in the economy should also allow for only limited one-time price effects this year and very little, if any, \"second round\" effects on inflation in the medium term. I expect that lower immigration will continue to lessen demand and reduce inflation, especially on housing services. I also expect that less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more friendly business environment are likely to boost supply and offset any tariff-related effects on economic activity and prices over the medium term.\nThe Policy Decision and the Path Forward\nSo far this year, even with inflation within range of our target, the Committee has focused primarily on the inflation side of the dual mandate. Now that we have seen many months of deteriorating labor market conditions, it is time for the Committee to act decisively and proactively to address decreasing labor market dynamism and emerging signs of fragility. In my view, the recent data, including the estimated payroll employment benchmark revisions, show that we are at serious risk of already being behind the curve in addressing deteriorating labor market conditions. Should these conditions continue, I am concerned that we will need to adjust policy at a faster pace and to a larger degree going forward.\nI recognize and appreciate concerns that we have not yet perfectly achieved our inflation goal. Because our dual mandate places equal weights on the two goals, we should turn our focus toward the side of the mandate that is showing signs of deterioration or fragility even though inflation is above but within range of our target. This should be especially the case since forecasters widely expect inflation to significantly decline next year, and as further deterioration in labor market conditions would likely lead to more persistent damage to the employment side of the mandate that would be difficult to address with our tools.\nIn my role as monetary policymaker, I am agnostic about why shocks happen, I take conditions as they are, and I make monetary policy decisions to support the economy. The credibility and effectiveness of the Federal Reserve depend on the public's trust that we will not bring a value judgment into our assessment of the underlying conditions.\nEconomic research is clear that, when conditions exist like those we are currently facing, monetary policy should de-emphasize inflation. The U.S. economy is experiencing aspects of a negative supply shock from higher tariffs that is also affecting aggregate demand. Since these conditions are unlikely to lead to persistent effects on inflation, and because changes in monetary policy take time to work their way through the economy, optimal policy calls for looking through temporarily elevated inflation readings. Therefore, we should proactively remove some policy restraint on aggregate demand to avoid damage to the labor market and a further weakening in the economy, provided that long-run inflation expectations remain well anchored.\nIn addition, putting tariffs aside, the U.S. economy may also be experiencing an extended productivity surge, in large part because of recent technological advances. And productivity growth has likely been higher than reported due to the downward benchmark revisions to payroll gains. These developments reinforce the case for removing policy restraint because monetary policy should accommodate productivity shocks that raise potential output.\nIn light of all these considerations, in my view, it was appropriate to begin the process of moving policy toward a more neutral stance at this meeting, and it has been for several months. In thinking about the path forward, I supported revising the characterization of the policy outlook in the post-meeting statement. It is important we signal that last week's action includes a forward-looking view of additional adjustments. If the statement had not included a reference to additional cuts, it would have signaled to markets that the Committee would not be responsive to weakening labor market conditions.\nI am concerned that the labor market could enter into a precarious phase and there is a risk that a shock could tip it into a sudden and significant deterioration. Characterizing an appropriate forward-looking view of additional policy adjustments is important because it shapes the expected path of short-term interest rates, which, in turn, affects longer-term interest rates, including mortgage and corporate bond rates, that are key for household and business decisionmaking. Cutting the policy rate 25 basis points and signaling additional adjustments at upcoming meetings should allow longer-term interest rates to remain materially lower than earlier this year and help to support the economy.\nFinally, I should note that the rising downside risks to employment and the potential for greater damage to the labor market underscore the need to shift our focus away from overemphasizing the latest data points. A strict interpretation of data dependence is inherently backward looking and would guarantee that we remain behind the curve, requiring us to overcorrect in the future. I think we should consider reframing our focus from overweighing the latest data to a proactive forward-looking approach and a forecast that reflects how the economy is likely to evolve going forward. This approach would better position us to avoid falling behind the curve and then having to implement abrupt and dramatic policy actions.\nDuring this intermeeting period, I will continue to carefully monitor the incoming data and information as the Administration's policies, the economy, and financial markets continue to evolve. Before our next meeting in October, we will have received one additional month of employment and inflation data. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts to discuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance going forward.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on each of our assessments of the incoming data and the implications for risks to the outlook, guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable ",

Miran\nAt the Economic Club of New York, New York, New York\nShare\nI'd like to thank the Economic Club of New York for the invitation to speak today.\n1\nThis is my first time speaking in my new capacity as a member of the Federal Reserve Board. As such, I would like to be transparent on my thinking. Subsequent to last week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), it should be clear that my view of appropriate monetary policy diverges from those of other FOMC members; I view policy as very restrictive, believe it poses material risks to the Fed's employment mandate, and would like to explain why.\nThere's no perfect means for determining appropriate monetary policy at any given time. That said, rules of a Taylor type are a useful way to gauge where the federal funds rate should be set based on the prevailing macroeconomic conditions and outlook. Let me first say that I find these types of policy rules to be useful as indications, but I am not slavishly devoted to them.\nThe Taylor rule suggests policymakers ought to think about three key variables in determining the appropriate fed funds rate: inflation, the neutral rate of interest, and the output gap. As one might expect, changes in inflation and employment\u00e2\u0080\u0094one way of framing the output gap\u00e2\u0080\u0094receive due attention from Fed officials. However, changes in the neutral rate, or the policy rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is at full employment, are often underappreciated.\nSome argue that leaving the neutral rate, which I will refer to as r*, out of the conversation makes sense because it is unobservable and therefore highly uncertain. But so are potential growth and the natural rate of unemployment, yet they are frequently updated and discussed. Because many r* estimates are based on empirical models requiring a great deal of time-series data, they can be backward-looking and slow to adjust. Moving too slowly to update a rapidly changing neutral rate raises the risk of policy mistakes.\nR* reflects the balance of saving and investment in an economy and it evolves over time with demographics, productivity, fiscal policy, and other factors. It is my view that previously high immigration rates and large fiscally driven decreases in net national saving, both of which raise neutral rates, were insufficiently accounted for in previous estimates of neutral rates. Monetary policy was not as tight as many believed. That same effect may be taking place today, but in the opposite direction. In my view, insufficiently accounting for the strong downward pressure on the neutral rate resulting from changes in border and fiscal policies is leading some to believe policy is\nless\nrestrictive than it actually is.\nToday, I will give explicit consideration to nonmonetary factors\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as shifts in border and tax policy, trade renegotiation, and regulatory dynamics\u00e2\u0080\u0094that can have substantial effects on the appropriate setting for monetary policy. I'll focus on the factors that have changed most meaningfully over the course of 2025 as they relate to my expectations for inflation, r*, and the output gap, emphasizing ones I feel are underappreciated.\nBefore I proceed, I want to be clear: I am not attempting to provide an impossible degree of precision, but a general ballpark. Based on this analysis, I believe the appropriate fed funds rate is in the mid-2 percent area, almost 2 percentage points lower than current policy. The Federal Reserve has been entrusted with the important goal of promoting price stability for the good of all American households and businesses, and I am committed to bringing inflation sustainably back to 2 percent. However, leaving policy restrictive by such a large degree brings significant risks for the Fed's employment mandate.\nPolicies Impacting Inflation\nRents\nI'll start with inflation. The general approach I take is to assume all components of inflation that I'm not explicitly addressing will continue at their current run rates. I look forward to breaking down my expectations for other components of inflation in the future, but today I'll focus on what I consider to be first-order changes to the inflation forecast.\nHousing represents nearly 16 percent of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, and more than double that in the consumer price index (CPI). Housing affordability is highly influential for Americans' perception of, and experience of, the economy.\nBecause measured inflation incorporates rental inflation with a lag, it has remained elevated above market rents for several years, infamously \"catching up.\" While an index of all-tenant rents took time to incorporate the spike in new rents in 2021 and 2022, that gap subsequently closed, indicating the catch-up is complete.\n2\nNow, new rent indices show this inflation is well below all-tenant inflation, around 1 percent annualized.\n3\nRents for all tenants will fall toward this low rate as people moving or renewing leases sign at current market rates, and I expect CPI rent inflation will decline from its current level of roughly 3.5 percent to below 1.5 percent in 2027. This implies a roughly 0.3 percentage point decline in total PCE inflation; by early 2028, I expect that effect to grow to a 0.4 percentage point decline. Per a Taylor rule, that works out to an appropriate fed funds rate roughly half a percentage point lower than current shelter inflation would imply.\n4\nOne might characterize this view on rental inflation as optimistic. However, I believe forecasters have underappreciated the significant impact of immigration policy on rent inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094both on the way up and, now, on the way down. Work by Albert Saiz finds an elasticity of rents with respect to the number of renters of about 1, identified from a large quasi-random immigration shock.\n5,\ni\nNet immigration averaged roughly 1 million per year in the decade leading up to the pandemic.\n6\nGiven that roughly 100 million Americans rent, net zero immigration going forward would imply 1 point lower rent inflation per year.\nPolicies Affecting r*\nPopulation growth\nThe border story is also, in my view, affecting neutral rates. Steady-state population growth matters for neutral rates, and U.S. border policy has changed markedly, from effectively open borders to potentially negative net migration. Further, these effects may interact with a structurally aging population, which increases the supply of capital and reduces demand for investment. Indeed, analysis by Etienne Gagnon and others shows that demographic changes may have already lowered the neutral rate by over 1 percentage point since 1980.\n7\nThe U.S. population has grown by around 1 percent annually in recent years, driven in large part by illegal immigration. Already in the first half of this year, roughly 1.5 million of these immigrants have left the country, according to the Current Population Survey, though this number may be an overestimate due to nonresponse issues.\n8\nAssuming some overcounting, it is plausible to me that 2 million illegal immigrants will have exited the country by year-end, thereby reducing annual population growth from 1 percent to 0.4 percent. Based on estimates from both Weiske and Ho, a 1 percentage point drop in annual population growth can reduce r* by 0.6 percentage point. So, the expected decline in U.S. population growth equates to a nearly 0.4 percentage point drop in the neutral fed funds rate.\n9\nLabor market statistics and anecdotal evidence suggest border policy is exerting a major impact on the economy. While the effect would likely normalize over time, this reduced level of population growth is also consistent with zero net immigration in 2026 and 2027. It was just a few long years ago that there was widespread discussion about whether most developed economies would, due to declining fertility rates, converge to Japan's low interest rates without significant immigration; those economic dynamics are still a force, albeit among many others.\nIncreases in national saving from trade policy\nAdditionally, trade renegotiation and the tax legislation recently passed by the Congress should also affect r*. I think of this primarily through the increase in national saving\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, the net supply of loanable funds.\nWith respect to tariffs, relatively small changes in some goods prices have led to what I view as unreasonable levels of concern. While my read of the elasticities and incidence theory is that exporting nations will have to lower their selling prices, I also believe tariffs will lead to substantial swings in net national saving.\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates tariff revenue could reduce the federal budget deficit by over $380 billion per year over the coming decade.\n10\nThis is a significant swing in the supply\u00e2\u0080\u0093demand balance for loanable funds, as national borrowing declines by a comparable amount. A 1 percentage point change in the deficit-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio moves r* by nearly four tenths of a percentage point, according to the average of estimates summarized by Rachel and Summers.\n11\nThis 1.3 percent of GDP change in national saving reduces the neutral rate by half a percentage point.\n12\nTariffs are not the only means by which trade policy is affecting the supply of loanable funds. Loans and loan guarantees pledged by East Asian countries in exchange for relatively low tariff ceilings have reached $900 billion.\n13\nThese guarantees entail an exogenous increase in credit supply, which research suggests would be around 7 percent.\n14\nUsing Council of Economic Advisers' (CEA) estimates of the interest elasticity of investment and Michael Boskin's interest elasticity of saving, this would further reduce neutral policy rates by around two tenths of a percentage point.\n15\nIncreases in national saving from tax policy\nThe large tax law passed this year also has a strong effect on national saving.\n16\nThere are, of course, other consequences of the tax law besides the increase in net national saving, which I'll discuss later in the context of the output gap.\nThe CEA calculates an increase in national saving of $3.83 trillion over the next 10 years (relative to the previous policy baseline), resulting from economic growth induced by tax policy.\n17\nThis represents roughly 1.3 percent of GDP, implying a half of a percentage point reduction in r* and the appropriate policy rate through the Rachel\u00e2\u0080\u0093Summers channel.\nIndeed, the federal deficit in the second and third fiscal quarters of this year was nearly $140 billion less than in the comparable period last year. This is a small sample size but indicative, in my opinion, of the direction of the deficit.\nOn the other hand, the CEA estimates that the tax law will generate annual investment increases of up to 10 percent in the next several years relative to the previous policy baseline. This should be associated with an increase in r*, and thus the appropriate fed funds rate, of around three tenths of a point. Let me also note that while I am relying partially on previous CEA research at the moment, I look forward to working more with Board staff and their forecasts in the coming months.\nEffect of deregulation and energy on r*\nAmerica's regulatory patchwork has become a material impediment to growth.\n18\nEconomists tend to underappreciate the economic impact of regulations, largely because qualitative factors can be difficult to study empirically. In many cases, a regulation can serve as an infinite tax rate, prohibiting activity altogether. An interdiction on output because a special snail is found in a region will restrict output much more than any finite tax.\nRegulation hinders productivity growth, restricts capacity, and ultimately helps fuel inflation. Regulators may have good reason for doing so (maybe they value the snail), but we must be clear-eyed about the economic consequences.\nDeregulation raises the neutral rate of interest by increasing the marginal product of capital.\n19\nAnalysis by Dawson and Seater shows that half of the output effects of deregulatory policy are channeled improvements in total factor productivity (TFP), the key ingredient to greater living standards and higher real wages for workers.\n20\nPrevious CEA research on the benefits of deregulatory efforts suggests a roughly 0.5 percent annual boost to growth over a 20-year period, whereas CEA research on new energy policies suggests something closer to a 0.1 percent annual boost over a 10-year period.\n21\nThe cumulative effect of these policies is anywhere from a 3 to nearly 9 percent increase in TFP, translating to about a 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point increase in r*.\n22\nPolicies Impacting the Output Gap\nTax policy\nI'd like to shift from r* to the third component of the Taylor rule, the output gap, which reflects actual production's strength relative to the economy's potential. Analogously, policymakers frequently think of the employment gap as the difference between the actual unemployment rate and the lowest sustainable rate of unemployment that doesn't gin up inflation. While the substantial tax and spending cuts recently passed by the Congress increase net saving and therefore reduce r*, there are countervailing increases in appropriate policy via the output gap.\nThe tax law should significantly push out the economy's supply side, an important change to help minimize the potential for inflationary shocks. Reduced business and individual tax rates stimulate additional capital accumulation and labor supply. However, these work through expanding potential\nand\nactual GDP and thus should leave the output gap relatively unchanged. Aggregate demand, however, is also boosted by reduced taxes on seniors and lower-wage workers, balanced somewhat by cuts to entitlement spending and student lending.\nRelative to a pretax law policy baseline, CEA calculations using Congressional Budget Office estimates found a static $80 billion or so reduction in revenue and a $130 billion or so reduction in annual spending over a decade. Despite a greater reduction in spending than taxes, the literature consistently finds the tax multiplier to be larger than the spending multiplier.\n23\nThis implies an increase of actual output over potential of approximately $50 billion in the short run, or an increase in the output gap of nearly 0.2 percent of GDP. This translates into an increase in the appropriate federal funds rate of around 0.1 percentage point under the standard approach to the Taylor rule. The balanced-approach rule, which doubles the weight on the output gap and was favored by former Chairwoman Janet Yellen, would imply a 0.2 percentage point increase.\n24\nRegulatory and energy policies\nReturning to deregulatory and energy policie",

Waller\nAt the Economic Club of Miami, Miami, Florida\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Jon, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nSince I last spoke on the economy and monetary policy on July 17, economic data have reinforced my view of the outlook and my judgment that the time has come to ease monetary policy and move it to a more neutral stance.\n2\nIn July, I argued that, looking through tariff effects, with underlying inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate. Based on all the data in hand, I believe this argument is even stronger today, and that the downside risks to the labor market have increased.\nIn July, I warned that job creation was weaker than it seemed in the payroll numbers and that data due in early September would indicate that payroll growth will be significantly lowered when annual revisions are made next spring. But even before then, job creation came in soft in the employment report for July, and May and June were revised down sharply, for a three-month average pace for total nonfarm payroll growth of only 35,000. After accounting for these revisions and what we will learn in a couple of weeks, the data are likely to indicate that employment actually shrank over those three months. I will have more to say about labor market data revisions and how they should be treated in evaluating the monthly jobs report, one of the most valuable tools we have for judging economic conditions.\nI favored reducing the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at the FOMC's July meeting, and subsequent data on the labor market and inflation indicate this was the right call. That also seems to be the message from financial markets, which now expect a 25- basis-point cut at the FOMC's September meeting and put significant odds on an additional one or two cuts at the final two meetings of 2025. As I will discuss, factoring out estimates of the temporary effects of import tariffs, underlying inflation remains close to 2 percent. I believe the data on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation support moving policy toward a neutral setting. Based on the median of FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run value of the federal funds rate, neutral is 125 to 150 basis points lower than the current setting. While I believe we should have cut in July, I am still hopeful that easing monetary policy at our next meeting can keep the labor market from deteriorating while returning inflation to the FOMC's goal of 2 percent. So, let's get on with it.\nEconomic activity has slowed significantly in 2025 from 2024. Growth for the first half of the year was 1.4 percent.\ni\nLooking ahead, the limited evidence we have is consistent with continued sluggish growth. We don't have much data for the second half, but smoothing through the monthly volatility, retail sales for July suggest that consumers are continuing to spend, albeit at a slower pace than last year. Meanwhile, manufacturing output in the report on industrial production was flat in July, and according to purchasing managers, new orders for manufacturing are consistent with a modest decline in the next few months. For the large majority of businesses outside of manufacturing, new orders are consistent with roughly flat production in the coming months.\nMany forecasters have said they expect household and business spending and investment decisions will be weighed down by tariffs\u00e2\u0080\u0094those enacted, and the uncertainty about tariff levels in the future. Tariffs affect the costs and profits of businesses and, to the degree that they raise prices, also affect the real disposable income of consumers. Some businesses will be directly affected by tariffs, but many more will be affected by how tariffs crimp household spending. Tariff effects on households and businesses also will weigh on employment. All of this is consistent with what my business contacts are telling me, which is that they are postponing investment and hiring because of the uncertainty about how tariffs will affect their input costs and demand for their products. That said, I'm starting to hear some rumblings that businesses cannot sit on the sidelines forever. So we could see, at least, investment projects that were postponed begin to pick up, which would be positive for the economy. But how employment decisions evolve is more up in the air. I will be monitoring these business decisions because they are key to how activity will unfold in the second half of the year.\nReturning to the labor market, risks are continuing to build. In my July 17 speech, I said that private-sector job creation was nearing stall speed, and the data received since then have put an exclamation point on this statement. I always say that one month is not a trend, but now we have three months of weak job-creation data from the Current Employment Statistics. After revisions included in the July report, private-sector job creation averaged 52,000 in May, June, and July, about half the rate in the first quarter of 2025. The headline numbers, including public-sector workers, are, as I noted earlier, even worse, but I tend to focus on the private sector as a better indication of the underlying momentum in the labor market.\nThat's the picture after the unusually large revisions to May and June payrolls and the soft reading for July that was included in the latest jobs report. In addition to those revisions, on September 9 we will get a preliminary estimate of what to expect in the annual \"benchmark\" revisions to 2025 early next year. I estimate that monthly job creation will be reduced by an average of about 60,000 a month.\n3\nThat would mean that private-sector employment actually shrank, on average, in the past three months and that job creation earlier in the year was weaker than currently reported.\n4\nI have heard the argument that declining labor supply due to lower immigration means that low jobs numbers aren't as bad as they look and that the \"breakeven\" number for keeping the unemployment rate steady is declining. To those people, I would say: Yes, these estimates have been falling, but I haven't heard anyone say the breakeven level is negative. Supply-side changes can't account for the ugly jobs numbers of the past three months.\nOther data support the idea that labor demand may be on the edge of a sharp decline. For example, wage growth for people switching to new jobs is lower than for people staying in the same job, the opposite of what we see in a strong labor market. A few years ago, the rate of people quitting their jobs surged, and job switchers were getting substantially larger raises than those staying in their jobs. Today the quits rate is back down to its mid-2010s level, and these individuals must be switching jobs for reasons other than gains in compensation.\nAnother sign of a weakening in the labor market is that the unemployment rates for some cyclically sensitive groups of workers, such as teenagers, are up sharply this year, to levels, again, similar to those in the softer job market of the mid-2010s. Supplementing this hard evidence of falling labor demand is the consistent story from my business contacts that they are not hiring. The mix of reasons is not only uncertainty over tariff policy and slowing demand for their goods and services, but also, increasingly, uncertainty over how to use artificial intelligence, which is especially freezing hiring for some entry-level jobs.\n5\nThis softening in labor demand is occurring at the same time, as I noted earlier, that there is a decline in labor supply. I often hear the argument that the unemployment rate is the key labor market indicator because it reflects what is happening in both demand and supply. And given that the current unemployment rate is 4.2 percent, close to most estimates of maximum employment and barely changed over the last year, this suggests that the labor market is solid. While I would normally agree with this statement, I do not think it is accurate now. I believe that any decline in labor supply is only masking weakening demand in the labor market. Whether or not supply is down, weakening demand is not good, and it is specifically what monetary policy is intended to address.\nBefore I move on from the labor market, let me address a question of some public debate recently, which is the quality of the payroll data. As should be obvious from these remarks and others I have delivered, I consider the monthly jobs report, including its estimate of payroll employment, an absolutely indispensable tool in evaluating the economy and setting monetary policy, and that view is close to unanimous among economic forecasters and policymakers. Considering how important this data is in getting an accurate and reliable read on the state of the labor market, it is entirely appropriate to examine the quality of the jobs numbers and the process by which they are collected. There is always room for improvement in data collection and analysis. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and other agencies that collect economic data have benefited from expert committees of outside advisers who have provided advice on ways to improve data quality.\nThere has been substantial commentary since the last jobs report regarding the declining response rate of establishments and individuals in the employment survey and the outsized revisions of the data. This commentary has raised questions about the quality of the employment survey data. So I want to address this issue and clarify some facts about the survey response and the revisions. When the BLS sends out the establishment survey for a given month, it gives firms three months to return the survey\u00e2\u0080\u0094they can return it in the first month, the second month, or the third month. Some firms do not respond at all. Firms that submit their responses in the first month are the basis for the initial, or preliminary, payroll estimate. Those firms that respond in the second month get added to the first-month responders to get an updated number, which yields the first revision that is published a month later. Then the firms that respond in the final month provide the BLS with the final numbers for the original month. This is the second revision and is the official payroll estimate for that month.\nA decade ago, the response rate for the first month was 75 percent, meaning three-fourths of the firms surveyed responded immediately. But the initial response rate has fallen to 60 percent recently. Does that imply that the overall response rate for the entire three-month period has fallen? No, response rates by the final estimate have not fallen\u00e2\u0080\u0094about 95 percent of firms responded a decade ago, and that is how many are responding now. What has happened is that U.S. firms are slower in returning the survey. Ten years ago, if the survey had been sent to 100 firms, 75 would respond in the first month, and 20 firms would respond in the next two months. But now only 60 firms respond in the first month, and 35 firms respond in the second and third months. But in both cases, 95 out of 100 firms surveyed responded.\n6\nWhat are the implications of this delayed response pattern? First, if more data come in later in the survey period, then the initial estimate is less likely to accurately represent the final estimate, which means you are more likely to get significant revisions in the second and third months. The revisions do not mean the quality of the data has declined; it simply reflects the fact that more data is coming in late in the survey period.\nA second point is that revisions have been, on average, negative for the past couple of years, and while the recent revisions were large, revisions have not been getting bigger, on average, based on an analysis recently issued by economists at J.P. Morgan.\n7\nThey did find that large revisions are often associated with major turning points in the labor market. One possibility is that the recent large revisions in the payroll data for May and June indicate the labor market is at an inflection point and may worsen in coming months.\nOverall, the delay in responses does mean that we can expect initial reports to be noisier and more prone to revision. One month of data has never constituted a trend, but it is going to be especially important to take near-month payroll data with a grain of salt and form a picture of the labor market based on several months of results and a range of other labor market indicators. I hope my analysis of the labor market shows you that I do exactly that.\nLet me now turn to the outlook for inflation. Earlier this month, we received consumer and producer price information for July that allows for an estimate of inflation based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the FOMC's preferred measure. Based on those reports, PCE inflation increased 2.6 percent over the 12 months ended in July, and PCE inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices increased 2.9 percent. We will get the official data tomorrow.\nInflation has increased since the first quarter, but these numbers include the effects of import tariff increases, which, with inflation expectations anchored, I continue to expect will only temporarily raise inflation. Federal Reserve staff has extracted the tariff effects of inflation, and their latest estimates imply that without these effects, underlying inflation continues to run close to the FOMC's 2 percent target.\n8\nThere is still considerable uncertainty about how much more, and how quickly, tariffs will pass through to consumer prices. I have seen estimates that vary widely in the share of tariffs borne by exporters, importers, and consumers, and that tells me that one must be careful not to presume that some will bear a lot more than others. I continue to assume that the three groups affected by tariffs will share the costs roughly equally\u00e2\u0080\u0094one-third, one-third, and one-third. Most forecasts are for 12-month inflation to continue to slowly increase for a couple more months, with monthly tariff effects dissipating by early 2026.\nI believe that monetary policy should look through the tariff effects on inflation. With underlying inflation close to 2 percent, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, and the chances of an undesirable weakening in the labor market increased, proper risk management means the FOMC should be cutting the policy rate now. I felt this way in July, and all the evidence since then has led me to feel more strongly about it today. Based on what I know today, I would support a 25 basis point cut at the Committee's meeting on September 16 and 17. Whi",

Powell\nAt \u00e2\u0080\u009cLabor Markets in Transition:  Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an economic symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming\nShare\nWatch Live\nslide 1\nOver the course of this year, the U.S. economy has shown resilience in a context of sweeping changes in economic policy. In terms of the Fed's dual-mandate goals, the labor market remains near maximum employment, and inflation, though still somewhat elevated, has come down a great deal from its post-pandemic highs. At the same time, the balance of risks appears to be shifting.\nIn my remarks today, I will first address the current economic situation and the near-term outlook for monetary policy. I will then turn to the results of our second public review of our monetary policy framework, as captured in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that we released today.\nCurrent Economic Conditions and Near-Term Outlook\nWhen I appeared at this podium one year ago, the economy was at an inflection point. Our policy rate had stood at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for more than a year. That restrictive policy stance was appropriate to help bring down inflation and to foster a sustainable balance between aggregate demand and supply. Inflation had moved much closer to our objective, and the labor market had cooled from its formerly overheated state. Upside risks to inflation had diminished. But the unemployment rate had increased by almost a full percentage point, a development that historically has not occurred outside of recessions.\n1\nOver the subsequent three Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, we recalibrated our policy stance, setting the stage for the labor market to remain in balance near maximum employment over the past year\n(figure 1)\n.\nThis year, the economy has faced new challenges. Significantly higher tariffs across our trading partners are remaking the global trading system. Tighter immigration policy has led to an abrupt slowdown in labor force growth. Over the longer run, changes in tax, spending, and regulatory policies may also have important implications for economic growth and productivity. There is significant uncertainty about where all of these polices will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be.\nChanges in trade and immigration policies are affecting both demand and supply. In this environment, distinguishing cyclical developments from trend, or structural, developments is difficult. This distinction is critical because monetary policy can work to stabilize cyclical fluctuations but can do little to alter structural changes.\nThe labor market is a case in point. The July employment report released earlier this month showed that payroll job growth slowed to an average pace of only 35,000 per month over the past three months, down from 168,000 per month during 2024\n(figure 2)\n.\n2\nThis slowdown is much larger than assessed just a month ago, as the earlier figures for May and June were revised down substantially.\n3\nBut it does not appear that the slowdown in job growth has opened up a large margin of slack in the labor market\u00e2\u0080\u0094an outcome we want to avoid. The unemployment rate, while edging up in July, stands at a historically low level of 4.2 percent and has been broadly stable over the past year. Other indicators of labor market conditions are also little changed or have softened only modestly, including quits, layoffs, the ratio of vacancies to unemployment, and nominal wage growth. Labor supply has softened in line with demand, sharply lowering the \"breakeven\" rate of job creation needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. Indeed, labor force growth has slowed considerably this year with the sharp falloff in immigration, and the labor force participation rate has edged down in recent months.\nOverall, while the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers. This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.\nAt the same time, GDP growth has slowed notably in the first half of this year to a pace of 1.2 percent, roughly half the 2.5 percent pace in 2024\n(figure 3)\n. The decline in growth has largely reflected a slowdown in consumer spending. As with the labor market, some of the slowing in GDP likely reflects slower growth of supply or potential output.\nTurning to inflation, higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods. Estimates based on the latest available data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in July. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent, above their level a year ago. Within core, prices of goods increased 1.1 percent over the past 12 months, a notable shift from the modest decline seen over the course of 2024. In contrast, housing services inflation remains on a downward trend, and nonhousing services inflation is still running at a level a bit above what has been historically consistent with 2 percent inflation\n(figure 4)\n.\n4\nThe effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible. We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts. The question that matters for monetary policy is whether these price increases are likely to materially raise the risk of an ongoing inflation problem. A reasonable base case is that the effects will be relatively short lived\u00e2\u0080\u0094a one-time shift in the price level. Of course, \"one-time\" does not mean \"all at once.\" It will continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks. Moreover, tariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process.\nIt is also possible, however, that the upward pressure on prices from tariffs could spur a more lasting inflation dynamic, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed. One possibility is that workers, who see their real incomes decline because of higher prices, demand and get higher wages from employers, setting off adverse wage\u00e2\u0080\u0093price dynamics. Given that the labor market is not particularly tight and faces increasing downside risks, that outcome does not seem likely.\nAnother possibility is that inflation expectations could move up, dragging actual inflation with them. Inflation has been above our target for more than four years and remains a prominent concern for households and businesses. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations, however, as reflected in market- and survey-based measures, appear to remain well anchored and consistent with our longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent.\nOf course, we cannot take the stability of inflation expectations for granted. Come what may, we will not allow a one-time increase in the price level to become an ongoing inflation problem.\nPutting the pieces together, what are the implications for monetary policy? In the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside, and risks to employment to the downside\u00e2\u0080\u0094a challenging situation. When our goals are in tension like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate. Our policy rate is now 100 basis points closer to neutral than it was a year ago, and the stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance. Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\nMonetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC members will make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks. We will never deviate from that approach.\nEvolution of Monetary Policy Framework\nTurning to my second topic, our monetary policy framework is built on the unchanging foundation of our mandate from Congress to foster maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We remain fully committed to fulfilling our statutory mandate, and the revisions to our framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions. Our revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which we refer to as our consensus statement, describes how we pursue our dual-mandate goals. It is designed to give the public a clear sense of how we think about monetary policy, and that understanding is important both for transparency and accountability, and for making monetary policy more effective.\nThe changes we made in this review are a natural progression, grounded in our ever-evolving understanding of our economy. We continue to build upon the initial consensus statement adopted in 2012 under Chair Ben Bernanke's leadership. Today's revised statement is the outcome of the second public review of our framework, which we conduct at five-year intervals.\u00e2\u0080\u00af This year's review included three elements: Fed Listens events at Reserve Banks around the country, a flagship research conference, and policymaker discussions and deliberations, supported by staff analysis, at a series of FOMC meetings.\n5\nIn approaching this year's review, a key objective has been to make sure that our framework is suitable across a broad range of economic conditions. At the same time, the framework needs to evolve with changes in the structure of the economy and our understanding of those changes. The Great Depression presented different challenges from those of the Great Inflation and the Great Moderation, which in turn are different from the ones we face today.\n6\nAt the time of the last review, we were living in a new normal, characterized by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound (ELB), along with low growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve\u00e2\u0080\u0094meaning that inflation was not very responsive to slack in the economy.\n7\nTo me, a statistic that captures that era is that our policy rate was stuck at the ELB for seven long years following the onset of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in late 2008. Many here will recall the sluggish growth and painfully slow recovery of that era. It appeared highly likely that if the economy experienced even a mild downturn, our policy rate would be back at the ELB very quickly, probably for another extended period. Inflation and inflation expectations could then decline in a weak economy, raising real interest rates as nominal rates were pinned near zero. Higher real rates would further weigh on job growth and reinforce the downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations, triggering an adverse dynamic.\nThe economic conditions that brought the policy rate to the ELB and drove the 2020 framework changes were thought to be rooted in slow-moving global factors that would persist for an extended period\u00e2\u0080\u0094and might well have done so, if not for the pandemic.\n8\nThe 2020 consensus statement included several features that addressed the ELB-related risks that had become increasingly prominent over the preceding two decades. We emphasized the importance of anchored longer-term inflation expectations to support both our price-stability and maximum-employment goals. Drawing on an extensive literature on strategies to mitigate risks associated with the ELB, we adopted flexible average inflation targeting\u00e2\u0080\u0094a \"makeup\" strategy to ensure that inflation expectations would remain well anchored even with the ELB constraint.\n9\nIn particular, we said that, following periods when inflation had been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy would likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\nIn the event, rather than low inflation and the ELB, the post-pandemic reopening brought the highest inflation in 40 years to economies around the world. Like most other central banks and private-sector analysts, through year-end 2021 we thought that inflation would subside fairly quickly without a sharp tightening in our policy stance\n(figure 5)\n.\n10\nWhen it became clear that this was not the case, we responded forcefully, raising our policy rate by 5.25 percentage points over 16 months. That action, combined with the unwinding of pandemic supply disruptions, contributed to inflation moving much closer to our target without the painful rise in unemployment that has accompanied previous efforts to counter high inflation.\nElements of the Revised Consensus Statement\nThis year's review considered how economic conditions have evolved over the past five years. During this period, we saw that the inflation situation can change rapidly in the face of large shocks. In addition, interest rates are now substantially higher than was the case during the era between the GFC and the pandemic. With inflation above target, our policy rate is restrictive\u00e2\u0080\u0094modestly so, in my view. We cannot say for certain where rates will settle out over the longer run, but their neutral level may now be higher than during the 2010s, reflecting changes in productivity, demographics, fiscal policy, and other factors that affect the balance between saving and investment\n(figure 6)\n. During the review, we discussed how the 2020 statement's focus on the ELB may have complicated communications about our response to high inflation. We concluded that the emphasis on an overly specific set of economic conditions may have led to some confusion, and, as a result, we made several important changes to the consensus statement to reflect that insight.\nFirst, we removed language indicating that the ELB was a defining feature of the economic landscape. Instead, we noted that our \"monetary policy strategy is designed to promote maximum employment and stable prices across a broad range of economic conditions.\" The difficulty of operating near the ELB remains a potential concern, but it is not our primary focus. The revised statement reiterates that the Committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum-employment and price-stability goals, particularly if the federal funds rate is constrained by the ELB.\nSecond, we returned to a framework of flexible inflation targeting and eliminated the \"makeup\" strategy. As it turned out, the idea of an intentional, moderate inflation overshoot had proved irrelevant. There was nothing intentional or moderate about the inflation that arrived a few months after we announced our 2020 changes to the consensus statement, as I acknowledged publicly in 2021.\n11\nWell-an",

Waller\nAt the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium 2025, Teton Village, Wyoming\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for inviting me to speak today on payments innovation.\n1\nIt is an exciting time to work in payments. While I have always been interested in the topic, I would have never imagined decades ago that payments would generate this amount of enthusiasm, where now some of the coolest jobs in tech are working in this area.\nThe payment system is experiencing what I have called a \"technology-driven revolution,\" where the latest advances in computing power, data processing, and distributed networks have fueled growth in innovative new payment services.\n2\nThis includes 24/7 instant payments, user-friendly digital wallets and mobile payment apps, and stablecoins and other digital assets. Alongside these new services sits enabling technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), that has the potential to improve the precision and efficiency of the underlying payment products even further.\nWhile there has been a lot of excitement, and admittedly sometimes hype, around the possibilities of these new technologies, there have also been some who have been fearful or skeptical of innovation in this space. But we only have to look to history to see that the evolution of the payment system has long been a story of technological advancement.\nIn any payment transaction, three things happen. First, an object is bought and paid for with another object. Second, there is a technology for conducting this transaction. Finally, there is a technology for recording the history of the transaction and ownership of the objects. For example, I can go to the grocery store and buy an apple and use a digital dollar in my checking account to pay for it. I tap my debit card on a card reader to conduct the transaction. Finally, the machine prints out a receipt, which is the record of the transaction. The same process applies to the crypto world. I buy a meme coin and use a stablecoin as the means of payment. The transaction takes place using a smart contract. Finally, the transaction is recorded on a distributed ledger.\n3\nThere is nothing scary about this just because it occurs in the decentralized finance or defi world\u00e2\u0080\u0094this is simply new technology to transfer objects and record transactions. There is nothing to be afraid of when thinking about using smart contracts, tokenization, or distributed ledgers in everyday transactions.\nThe technologies available today might be new, but leveraging innovative technology to build new payment services is not a new story. What I'd like to emphasize today is that the private and public sectors can both embrace innovation within their respective roles.\nFirst, I will recap how I generally approach these issues. I am a strong believer in the benefits of the free market. I hold the view that it is generally the private sector that can most reliably and efficiently allocate resources and take risks to explore the value of new technologies. I also see firsthand the important role the Federal Reserve plays in fostering a payment and settlement system that is both safe and efficient. Such a system promotes a vibrant economy, since it allows for participation from a broad range of individuals and businesses without requiring them to invest heavily in bilateral arrangements.\n4\nI would argue that broadly, there have been two models of payments innovation, which can be useful in characterizing the longer-term arc of payments evolution, as well as some recent developments. The first is private sector-driven innovation. As I have noted, this should be the default model. The second approach is where public sector entities like the Fed build platforms that enable the private sector to offer services to their customers. This should be done only rarely, and in instances where there is a specific market need. Both models are important in the payments ecosystem, and I'll walk through some historical and recent examples.\nLet's take the first model of private sector-led innovation and use payment cards as an example. Early cards were metal plates or cardboard, then they incorporated magnetic strips, then chips, and now I tap my phone to pay. In the early days of consumer credit used for transactional purposes, privately operated card companies seized on the availability of new technology to support automated card authorizations and processing, continually upgrading over time, to build what are now global networks of interconnected banks that support the preferred payment method for consumers and many small businesses in the United States.\n5\nHere, the private sector demonstrated its ability to effectively build a payment service that met the needs of consumers, all based on proprietary technology. Even still, card networks interact with the broader payments, clearing, and settlement ecosystem, benefitting from Fed-operated payment infrastructures for settlement of interbank obligations.\n6\nStablecoins are the latest example of private sector-led innovation in payments.\n7\nThe original use of stablecoins was to facilitate crypto trading. Crypto-asset prices can be volatile and as with any financial market, there is a need for traders to move out of relatively risky positions into safer ones with a stable asset price. As the stablecoin market matured, firms found that the properties of stablecoins using distributed ledger technology\u00e2\u0080\u0094 including 24/7 availability, fast transferability, and their freely circulating nature \u00e2\u0080\u0094could be attractive for other use cases as well. That includes providing a means to access and hold U.S. dollars, particularly in countries with high inflation or without easy or affordable access to dollar cash or banking services. In fact, I believe that stablecoins have the potential to maintain and extend the role of the dollar internationally. Stablecoins also have the potential to improve retail and cross-border payments.\nI spoke about the maturing stablecoin market in February of this year, and, at the time, I noted the need for a regulatory regime for stablecoins in the U.S to provide regulatory clarity and reduce regulatory fragmentation for market participants.\n8\nLast month, the GENIUS Act became the first major crypto-asset legislation to become law. This was an important step for the payment stablecoin market and could help stablecoins reach their full potential. Stablecoins, like card payments, are a private sector-driven innovation. And, like card payments, we see connections to the traditional payments, clearing, and settlement ecosystem. For example, many stablecoin arrangements use legacy payment services to fund and redeem stablecoin balances.\nIn addition to stablecoins, the use of AI in payments is an area where we are seeing significant private sector-led innovation. Here, AI is not serving as payments infrastructure but as an enabling technology that could bring considerable benefits to both private and public sector-operated payment services.\nIt may surprise some to learn that, within the financial sector, the payments industry has long been at the forefront of AI adoption. This is true for several major waves of AI technology. Since the early 1990s, payment firms have used machine learning for things like detecting fraud and money laundering, or predicting payment flows and trends.\n9\nMore recently, as large language models and generative AI have matured, payments innovators have used the technology to further enhance fraud detection and compliance systems and to make the cumbersome process of reconciling payments files more accurate and efficient. Agentic AI systems, which operate autonomously by planning and executing multistep processes, appear to be the next wave of AI advancement. While agentic AI is still in its early days, payments innovators in the private sector are once again channeling the promise of this technology and rapidly building out various use cases.\nNow, let's touch briefly on the second model of public sector innovation of payments infrastructures to support the private sector. Almost since its founding, the Federal Reserve has provided core clearing and settlement infrastructure to maintain the safety and efficiency of the payment system. The Fed has consistently upgraded the infrastructure over time using the latest available technology. For example, in the early 20th century, interbank transfers were effected through telegraph wires\u00e2\u0080\u0094an early version of Fedwire\u00e2\u0080\u0094then through emerging forms of electronic payment messages. Now fast-forward to this century where we have interbank payment systems that process transactions in real time.\n10\nBanks, payment services providers, and even fintechs have used the infrastructure provided by the Fed to build payment services that their customers demand.\nAll of this is to demonstrate that the evolution of the payment system has long been a story of technological advancement. Much of this evolution has been led by private sector innovators. Key components have been supported by the Federal Reserve, either providing core infrastructure as a payment system operator or in convening the industry around specific solutions like payment standards.\n11\nThese complementary roles have led to a U.S. payment system that operates safely and efficiently and serves as a backbone for commerce in the U.S. and globally. That is why it is important for the Federal Reserve to continue to embrace technological advancements to modernize its services and continue to support private sector innovation.\nThe Fed is also conducting technical research on the latest wave of innovations, including tokenization, smart contracts, and AI in payments. As a payment system operator, it is important to understand trends in payments technology so that we can continue to support private sector firms that leverage our infrastructures, as well as understand whether emerging technologies could provide opportunities to improve our existing platforms and services. Finally, we engage with innovators like you to better understand new technologies and their potential to improve payments. In fact, it is my belief that the Federal Reserve could benefit from further engagement with innovators in industry, particularly as there is increased convergence between the traditional financial sector and the digital asset ecosystem. We are working on ways to further that engagement, so stay tuned.\n1. Thank you to Alex Sproveri and Kirstin Wells of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance in preparing this text.

Bowman\nAt the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium 2025, Teton Village, Wyoming\nShare\nWatch Live\nGood afternoon and thank you to the organizers of the 2025 Wyoming Blockchain Symposium for inviting me to speak to you today.\n1\nIt is an honor to be included in this year's event, which is being held at a critical moment for American leadership in the digital asset space. We are at the beginning of what appears to be a seismic shift in the way we think about money, value, and the fabric of our financial system. This shift is not just about incremental changes or tweaks to the existing system. What we are witnessing has the potential to fundamentally transform the way we live, work, and interact in society.\nIt is inspiring to be together with all of you, as thought leaders engaged in developing technologies that could help shape the financial system in the future. You don't need a tech background to appreciate the opportunity that blockchain provides to the financial system.\nFinancial services innovation drives faster, safer, cheaper, and more customized products that more efficiently meet the needs of consumers and businesses. Digital processes like wire transfers and ACH disrupted the need to move large amounts of physical currency and other hard assets, making the system more efficient and safer. Through technology, there is opportunity to transform how we think about transferring assets.\nThroughout recent history, whether previous transformations involved industrialization, communications, or the internet, each of these advances had a profound and lasting impact on our society. While the future is unknown and unknowable, I expect we will look back at some point to consider the impact of blockchain, AI, and quantum computing and marvel at the transformation of everyday business processes. Time will tell, but the opportunities and possibilities that lie ahead may be profound.\nOf course, you know better than most that bank regulators approach technology and periods of change with caution and skepticism, concerned about rapid growth, new business models, greater interconnectedness and interdependence, often focusing only on the risks. But risks may be offset or at least determined to be manageable when we recognize and consider the potentially extensive benefits of new technology.\nToday, I'd like to address the Federal Reserve's approach to thinking about technology and tools like blockchain in context of bank supervision, including recent developments, the cost of supervisory focus on \"reputational risk,\" and principles for a tailored regulatory framework that accommodates technology.\nReframing the Regulatory Mindset\nBank regulators work to promote safety and soundness in the financial system through regulation and supervisory practices. Our goal is not just a safe and sound banking system, but one that also serves its intended purpose of supporting consumers, businesses, and communities, and fostering economic growth. To accomplish this goal, regulators strive to strike a balance between managing risks that threaten safety and soundness, while also creating an environment that allows new technologies to take root and grow.\nInnovation outside the banking system often complements the development and use of technology within the banking system, and often far outpaces that growth. As you're all aware, many groundbreaking tech innovations have been pioneered by developers outside of the traditional banking system.\nDevelopments in the Banking System\nWe are seeing a number of promising developments in the banking and financial system, and I'll start with tokenization.\nWhile progress on tokenization is moving ahead, it's helpful to identify and understand the problem that it is intended to solve. One clear friction is in the transfer of asset ownership, which includes both completing the asset transfer\u00e2\u0080\u0094which may involve re-registering securities, or transferring physical assets\u00e2\u0080\u0094and coordinating the timing of the purchase and sale. Asset transfer frameworks are designed to minimize the risk of transaction failures, and have historically relied on escrow agents and manual processes. Tokenization has the potential to facilitate faster ownership transfer, mitigating some of these well-known risks and potentially lowering costs in the process.\nTokenized assets enable a transferor to pass title without changing a custodian or moving any physical security or asset. Many banks and international organizations have begun projects to develop this technology, but we have not yet seen broad adoption. It is possible that we could see a \"tipping point\" where the processes themselves are well-established, and legal frameworks have been updated to permit a wider range of activities relying on the new technology, and tokenized asset transfers become more of a market standard.\nThere are other potential advantages to tokenization, including expanding access to capital markets and facilitating near real-time payments. The speed and cost of wholesale payments, especially internationally, is a longstanding problem that tokenization could help to address. Banks of all sizes, including community banks, can benefit from efficiency gains that flow from asset tokenization. New technology and processes can open the door to direct, faster, and lower cost payments.\nWhile tokenization may be part of the solution to a number of known frictions in the banking system, the blockchain technology that it relies upon has already changed how banks seek to engage with their customers. For example, while digital assets have been considered to be risky, many banks are improving their tech stacks and security infrastructure to provide digital asset custody services to a wider range of retail customers. Very few bankers, and even fewer regulators, anticipated that the market would accommodate this development even just a few years ago. Yet we've seen much progress and a growing appetite for traditional bank engagement in this space. We are also seeing positive signs in the evolution of the digital asset user experience, making digital assets more accessible and easier to use.\nOne recent development\u00e2\u0080\u0094Congress passing the GENIUS Act and the President signing it into law\u00e2\u0080\u0094has brought stablecoins to the forefront of many discussions. And they are now positioned to become a fixture in the financial system, with implications and opportunities for the traditional banking system, including the potential to disrupt traditional payment rails. Congress tasked the banking agencies with creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, and we are working with our colleagues in the other agencies to move forward.\nIt is essential that banks and regulators are open to engaging in new technologies and departing from an overly cautious mindset. Regulators must understand new products and services and recognize the utility and necessity of embracing technology in the traditional financial sector.\nSo how do we accomplish this? Some of you may have had direct experience with regulators and the banking system, as you attempted to engage in this type of partnership with banks through the introduction of new technology and services. I am sure that many of you were not satisfied with these interactions. When you start from a world of possibility, where you move fast and break things to make rapid improvements, you may struggle with the complex and rigid regulatory constructs familiar to bankers and regulators. In this world, inertia can easily set in and pose resistance to anything not deemed within the realm of \"traditional\" banking activities.\nDespite this past inertia, change is coming.\nBank regulators are taking important steps to create a framework for digital assets and the adoption of blockchain technology within the banking system. These steps will promote accessibility to banking products and services by removing supervisory impediments that have stood in the way of bank relationships. I am also encouraged by the promise of this technology, by its ability to solve problems and improve the efficiency of the traditional financial system.\nTo this point, I have noted several use cases that have already been adopted or are in development within the banking system, but I would also like to encourage the industry to engage with regulators to help us understand blockchain and its potential to solve other problems. What is the value proposition of any new product or approach? What problem is it intended to address? And how should regulators consider both the risks and benefits, so we can provide a path to allow its use within the banking system?\nWe have already seen some initial benefits of bank AI adoption, and I continue to be encouraged by the significant ongoing investments being made in AI and in machine learning. These technologies have the potential to transform how business is conducted, including the way we detect and prevent fraud, manage risk, and provide customer service. During a recent banking conference at the Fed, Sam Altman, the CEO of Open AI, joined me for a fireside chat on AI in the banking and financial sector.\n2\nOne highlight from our discussion was the two-sided nature of how technology can impact banking transactions\u00e2\u0080\u0094just as AI can undermine customer verification methods designed to identify and mitigate fraud, AI tools can also be leveraged to detect and mitigate fraud.\nI see a similar challenge with blockchain technologies. Some bankers have expressed concerns about new technologies posing a threat to traditional business models and practices. But the banking system is constantly evolving, and technology can change the banking system regardless of how banks and regulators choose to respond. We must choose whether to embrace the change and help shape a framework that will be reliable and durable\u00e2\u0080\u0094ensuring safety and soundness and incorporating the benefits of both efficiency and speed\u00e2\u0080\u0094or to stand still and allow new technology to bypass the traditional banking system altogether. From a regulator's perspective, the choice is clear.\nI am open to these discussions, and I look forward to learning more. Many of you have a great deal to share and have new ideas about the best regulatory approach to blockchain and digital assets. Let me start with a specific request on fraud: how can new technologies be leveraged to fight fraud? Fraud is a major challenge in the financial services sector, and if blockchain or other new tools could mitigate it, we should explore those use cases. If fraud can be addressed using new technology, we should make sure that the regulatory framework does not stand in the way. I see this as an exciting opportunity for collaboration between industry and the Fed.\n3\nThe promise of technology and advances like AI are already positioned to impact parts of the banking and financial system. Ideally, changes will occur with the willing embrace of regulators\u00e2\u0080\u0094allowing use cases to proliferate in a way that benefits the banking system. If this is not our approach, then we risk the banking system becoming less relevant to consumers, businesses, and the overall economy. As a result, the banks will play a diminished role in the financial system more broadly. Those who follow developments in bank regulation have hopefully recognized some positive steps that demonstrate our commitment to embrace change. I am committed to changing our culture and attitude toward the adoption and integration of technology and new products and services.\nThe Hidden Role of Reputational Risk\nIn late June, the Board announced that reputational risk would no longer be considered in our supervisory process.\n4\nTo implement this lasting change, we are updating guidance, examination manuals, handbooks, and other supervisory materials to ensure the durability of this approach, which is a critical step in addressing the problem of de-banking. I am also considering whether we need a regulatory change to provide greater transparency and certainty about this approach. It is not the role of examiners or policymakers to direct which customers or industries to serve or which products to offer. That decision lies solely within the purview of bank management, limited by the safety and soundness of the institution,, the legal activities of its customer, and risks, if any, to financial stability.\nOver time, \"reputational risk\" emerged as a priority area that policymakers emphasized for examinations. Exams or reviews focused on reputational risk have often lacked a sufficient nexus to financial risk and safety and soundness considerations that are the appropriate focus of our supervisory activities.\nLet me be clear. We must adopt an approach that does not penalize or prohibit a bank from banking a customer engaged in legal activity. This approach must allow and encourage banks to provide banking products and services to any legal business, without disfavoring any particular viewpoints, businesses, or industries.\nThe Importance of Outreach\nThe industry\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether traditional finance, community banking, or digital assets\u00e2\u0080\u0094should expect a constructive engagement with our supervisors when discussing strategies and approaches for innovation. As regulators, we must engage in a way that enables our supervisory teams to understand the technology or innovation under consideration and have an open-minded view about the benefits and possibilities of a new approach, while also understanding effective mitigation strategies to address any risks. Banks should be encouraged to explore new technology, to engage in discussions with their regulators about how they can be deployed, and what reasonable supervisory expectations should apply. In this context, a healthy dialogue and a commitment to learning ensures the bank and examiner relationship can be collaborative rather than antagonistic in tone.\nInnovators, banks, and regulators must develop a constructive relationship, and this relies on a commitment to ongoing outreach. As I have demonstrated throughout my tenure as a regulator at both the state and federal levels, I am committed to outreach that enhances my understanding of industry preferences, challenges and better ways to engage with both developers and adopters. We should build an examination workforce that requires skills development and informed judgement to address evolving business preferences, practices and expectations. In a step toward doing so, last week, I announced that the Fed's \"novel supervision\" activities would be reintegrated into our Reserve Bank examination staff. This will reestablish the role of the normal supervisory process in monitoring banks' so-called \"novel activities.\"\n5\nOur approach should consider allowing Federal Reserve staff to hold de minimus amou",

Bowman\nAt the Kansas Bankers Association 2025 CEO & Senior Management Summit, Colorado Springs, Colorado\nShare\nThank you for inviting me to speak to you today.\n1\nIt is wonderful to join you again this year, now as the Fed's Vice Chair for Supervision. Since assuming this important financial regulatory role, we have hit the ground running\u00e2\u0080\u0094addressing some of the most critical matters in the bank regulatory space, all of which fall under the broad categories of improving efficiency, transparency, and fairness. Often, the \"headline\" issues coming out of the Federal Reserve and the other banking regulators are ones that affect the largest firms. And many are critical for both economic growth and financial stability.\nBut banks of all sizes, especially community banks, play a vital role in our economy and financial system, and we are continuing to directly engage as we draft regulatory and supervisory reforms. Community banks drive local economic growth, and they play a central role in the financial health of the customers and communities they serve, but these banks also face unique challenges.\nI will begin today by sharing my outlook on the economy and an update on the recent meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) before I dig a bit deeper into community banking issues.\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting\nAt last week's FOMC meeting, I dissented from the Committee's decision to hold the policy rate at its current level. Today I'd like to share some additional perspective about my views on the economy. So far this year, the FOMC has held the target range for the federal funds rate steady at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Earlier this year, I believed our policy stance was appropriate, giving time to allow the Committee to monitor the progress of inflation toward our goal and to better understand the impacts of the Administration's policies on the economy.\nAt the June FOMC meeting and in a speech shortly following that meeting, I began to lay out my reasoning to support the process of beginning to gradually lower the federal funds rate in July based on my assessment of signs of fragility in labor market conditions.\n2\nIn my view, economic conditions appeared to be shifting, and as a result, we should reflect this shift in our policy decisions. Inflation has moved considerably closer to our target, after excluding temporary effects of tariffs, and the labor market has remained near full employment. As my dissent statement notes, with economic growth slowing this year and signs of a less dynamic labor market becoming clear, I see it as appropriate to begin gradually moving our moderately restrictive policy stance toward a neutral setting. Taking action at last week's meeting would have proactively hedged against the risk of a further erosion in labor market conditions and a further weakening in economic activity.\nEconomic Conditions and Outlook\nThe U.S. economy has been resilient so far this year. Underlying economic growth has slowed markedly, but despite increasing signs of fragility as the latest employment report more clearly shows, the labor market appears to remain near estimates of full employment.\nSo far this year, consumer spending softened while residential investment declined, contributing to a much slower increase in private domestic final purchases compared to strong gains in 2024. Consumer spending on both goods and services has risen only modestly, reflecting slow gains in disposable personal income, lower levels of liquid savings, and high credit card utilization by lower-income households. Housing activity has declined, including in single-family home construction and sales, as listings of homes for sale are growing and house prices are falling, which suggests weakness in housing demand to a level last seen during the financial crisis.\nAlthough the unemployment rate remained historically low at 4.2 percent in July, the latest employment report confirmed some of the signs of fragility and reduced dynamism in the labor market that I discussed at last week's FOMC meeting without the benefit of having seen the July report. The unemployment rate moved back up in July and was close to rounding up to 4.3 percent, largely reflecting reduced hiring as businesses continue to retain existing workers instead of increasing layoffs. The employment-to-population ratio has dropped significantly this year, suggesting more softening in labor market conditions than the unemployment rate implies.\nPayroll employment growth slowed sharply to only 35,000 jobs per month over the three months ending in July. This is well below the moderate pace seen earlier in the year, likely due to a significant softening in labor demand. The sharp slowdown partly reflects the downward revision to payroll employment in both May and June, which, to put it in perspective, is comparable only to a few other two-month revisions over the past 30 years. In addition, job gains have been centered in an unusually narrow set of industries that tend to be less affected by the business cycle. For example, healthcare and social services have more than accounted for total job gains over the past three months, and the share of industries with job gains over the last six months dropped in July to a historically low level.\nTurning to price stability, the 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation stood at 2.8 percent in June, a bit lower than at the end of last year. However, after removing estimates of one-off tariff effects on goods prices, core PCE inflation would have been lower than 2.5 percent in June, which is significant progress and much closer to our 2 percent target. This progress reflects a considerable slowing in core services inflation, which is consistent with recent softness in consumer spending and the labor market no longer being a source of inflation pressures.\nThe underlying trend in core PCE inflation appears to be moving much closer to our 2 percent target than is currently shown in the data. With housing services inflation on a sustained downward trajectory and other core services inflation already consistent with 2 percent inflation, only core goods inflation remains elevated\u00e2\u0080\u0094likely reflecting limited passthrough from tariffs.\nIn terms of risks to achieving our dual mandate, as I gain even greater confidence that tariffs will not present a persistent shock to inflation, I see that upside risks to price stability have diminished. With underlying inflation on a sustained trajectory toward 2 percent, softness in aggregate demand, and signs of fragility in the labor market, I think that we should focus on risks to our employment mandate.\nWith the memories of pandemic worker shortages still fresh, businesses have chosen to maintain, instead of reducing, their work forces in response to the slowing economic conditions. And they seem to be more willing to reduce profit margins as they are less able to fully pass through higher costs and raise prices given the weakness in demand. If demand conditions continue to soften, businesses may need to begin to lay off workers, recognizing that it may not be as difficult to rehire given the shift in labor market conditions.\nOn trade policy, foreign suppliers are absorbing some of the new tariffs, and importers are shifting to lower tariffed sources. Slack in the economy should also allow for only limited one-time price effects this year and very little, if any, \"second-round\" effects on inflation in the medium term. I also expect that less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more friendly business environment are likely to boost supply and offset any tariff-related effects on economic activity and prices over the medium term.\nThe Policy Decision and the Path Forward\nWith tariff-related price increases likely representing a one-time effect, my view is that inflation will return to 2 percent after these effects dissipate. Because changes in monetary policy take time to work their way through the economy, it is appropriate to look through temporarily elevated inflation readings and therefore remove some policy restraint to avoid weakening in the labor market.\nAs I recognize that economic conditions are shifting, I believe that beginning to move our policy rate at a gradual pace toward its neutral level will help maintain the labor market near full employment and ensure smooth progress toward achieving our dual mandate. I see the risk that a delay in taking action could result in a deterioration in labor market conditions and a further slowing in economic growth.\nBefore our next meeting in September, we will receive a range of additional economic data and information, including another employment and two inflation reports. A proactive approach in moving policy closer to neutral, from its current moderately restrictive stance, would help avoid a further unnecessary erosion in labor market conditions and reduce the chance that the Committee will need to implement a larger policy correction should the labor market deteriorate further.\nIn my view, it is also important that the Committee's approach to monetary policy decision making is consistent over time\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially when we face shifting economic conditions. I recognize and appreciate that other FOMC members may see things differently and that they were more comfortable with leaving the target range for the policy rate unchanged. I am committed to working together with my colleagues to ensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our dual goals of maximum employment and price stability. In the meantime, I will continue to carefully monitor the incoming data and information as the Administration's policies, the economy, and financial markets continue to evolve.\nI have discussed many times in the past that, in recent years, the monthly labor market data have become increasingly difficult to interpret, in part, reflecting declining survey response rates and the changing dynamics of immigration and net business creation. It is crucial that U.S. official data accurately capture cyclical or structural changes in the labor market in real time so that we can more confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic policymaking. So, I remain cautious about taking too much signal from data releases, but I see the latest news on economic growth, the labor market, and inflation as consistent with greater risks to the employment side of our dual mandate.\nMy Summary of Economic Projections includes three cuts for this year, which has been consistent with my forecast since last December, and the latest labor market data reinforce my view. I want to reiterate, though, that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on each of our assessments of the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook, guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts to discuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance going forward.\nPrioritizing Community Banking Issues\nTurning back to community banking, I'd like to share some thoughts about how we identify the key issues facing community banks and prioritize them in our regulatory and supervisory reform efforts.\nMy approach to prioritizing these issues remains consistent and clear\u00e2\u0080\u0094it starts with outreach. Throughout my time as a member of the Board, I have focused on meeting with and listening to community bankers to better understand the unique challenges they face. What are the most significant threats to their business? How have regulations harmed or improved their ability to operate safely and soundly? How have competitive factors evolved within their communities? How do they see the business of banking evolving with the introduction of new technologies? Engaging with you and other community bankers has been a critical input to informing my views on the current state of bank regulation and supervision, which also shapes my priorities for regulatory and supervisory initiatives.\nAs regulators seek to identify problems in the bank regulatory system and craft approaches to address them, it is imperative that we focus on issues that impact community banks. And I am very pleased to announce that the Board will host a conference focused on community banking in Washington, D.C., on October 9th to ensure that our work is fully informed. We will bring together bankers, industry experts, academics, and other stakeholders to discuss and identify matters targeted to support our ongoing work.\nWe will continue to fully engage and to understand these banks' concerns. And, apart from fraud, which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment, the Federal Reserve has already started looking at elements of the bank regulatory framework unique to community banks. This includes the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR), liquidity sources and regulatory expectations, and rethinking capital options and operations for mutual banks.\nThe CBLR is a good example of a well-intentioned measure that underachieved in providing regulatory relief. The CBLR is an optional framework that was designed as an alternative to risk-based capital measures for community banks. A community bank that complies with the CBLR is deemed to comply with risk-based capital requirements.\n3\nStatutory limitations on the CBLR restricted the framework to between 8 and 10 percent for qualifying community banks.\n4\nThe agencies initially established the CBLR at 9 percent just as I joined the Board in late 2018.\n5\nIn rationalizing this setting, the agencies focused primarily on how many banks would be eligible to opt into the framework at their current capital levels and whether it could essentially retain the same high level of capital in the system.\nImplicit in this approach seems to be a view that Congress intended the agencies to keep the same overall amount of capital supporting community banks. However, by statute, Congress provided a range, and the low end is\ndouble\nthe standard leverage ratio capital requirement of 4 percent. The regulators also retained many of the same restrictive definitions, like the definition of qualifying tier 1 capital with associated exclusions and caps, that apply more generally to the largest institutions. While there were 4,022 community banks as of the first quarter of 2025, only 1,662 had opted into the CBLR.\n6\nNotably, data show that smaller community banks are more likely to have adopted the CBLR framework. About 53 percent of eligible community banks with assets less than $1 billion have opted in, compared t",

Bowman\nVice Chair for Supervision Michelle W. Bowman\nShare\nOn Wednesday, July 30, 2025, I dissented from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at its current level. As the Committee's post-meeting statement notes, I preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.\n1\nInflation has moved considerably closer to our target, after excluding temporary effects from tariffs, and the labor market remains near full employment. With economic growth slowing this year and signs of a less dynamic labor market, I saw it as appropriate to begin gradually moving our moderately restrictive policy stance toward a neutral setting. In my view, this action would have proactively hedged against a further weakening in the economy and the risk of damage to the labor market.\nThe U.S. Economy Has Remained Resilient\nThe U.S. economy has remained resilient in the first half of the year. Although underlying economic growth has slowed markedly, the labor market has remained stable near estimates of full employment. We have also seen meaningful progress in lowering inflation toward our 2 percent target, excluding tariff-related increases in goods prices.\nPrivate domestic final purchases have increased at a much slower pace this year as compared to strong gains in 2024, reflecting softening consumer spending, and declining residential investment. This weakness in demand likely reflects elevated interest rates, slower growth in personal income, and smaller liquid asset buffers and elevated credit card utilization rates among lower-income households.\nTotal payroll employment continued to increase moderately, and the unemployment rate remained historically low in June. However, the labor market has become less dynamic and shows increasing signs of fragility. The employment-to-population ratio has dropped significantly this year, businesses are reducing hiring but continue to retain their existing workers, and job gains have been centered in an unusually narrow set of industries that are less affected by the business cycle, including health care and social services.\nIn the absence of tariff effects on goods prices, the 12-month change in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices would have been less than 2.5 percent in June, lower than its elevated reading of 2.9 percent in December and considerably closer to our 2 percent target. This progress reflects the recent considerable slowing in core PCE services inflation, which is consistent with recent softness in consumer spending and the labor market no longer being a source of inflation pressures.\nIncreased Concerns about Our Employment Mandate\nIn terms of risks to achieving our dual mandate, I see that upside risks to price stability have diminished as I gain even greater confidence that tariffs will not present a persistent shock to inflation. With inflation on a sustained trajectory toward 2 percent, softness in aggregate demand, and signs of fragility in the labor market, I think that we should start putting more weight on risks to our employment mandate.\nThus far, with the memories of pandemic worker shortages still fresh, firms have resisted reducing their work forces in response to the slowing economic conditions. And they have appeared to be more willing to reduce profit margins as they are less able to fully pass through higher costs and raise prices given the weakness in demand. If demand conditions do not improve, firms may have little option other than to begin to lay off workers, recognizing that it may not be as difficult to rehire given the shift in labor market conditions.\nThe Policy Path as I See It\nWith tariff-related price increases likely representing a one-time effect, it is appropriate to look through temporarily elevated inflation readings. As I recognize that economic conditions are shifting, I believe that beginning to move our policy rate at a gradual pace toward its neutral level will help maintain the labor market near full employment and ensure smooth progress toward achieving both of our dual-mandate goals. I see the risk that a delay in taking action could result in a deterioration in the labor market and a further slowing in economic growth. Taking a proactive approach in moving closer to neutral would avoid an unnecessary erosion in labor market conditions and reduce the chance that the Committee will have to carry out a significantly larger policy correction at a future date.\nIn my view, it is also important that the Committee's approach to monetary policy decision making is consistent over time\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially when we are facing shifting economic conditions.\nI recognize and appreciate that other FOMC members may see things differently and that they were more comfortable with leaving the target range for the policy rate unchanged.

Waller\nGovernor Christopher J. Waller\nShare\nAt the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I dissented because I concluded that cutting the policy rate by 25 basis points was the appropriate stance of policy. In a speech I gave July 17, I laid out the case for cutting the policy rate at the July FOMC meeting and my views have not changed since then. I will recap the reasons for doing so.\nFirst, tariffs are one-off increases in the price level and do not cause inflation beyond a temporary increase. Standard central banking practice is to \"look through\" such price-level effects as long as inflation expectations are anchored, which they are.\nSecond, a host of data argues that monetary policy should now be close to neutral, not restrictive. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was 1.2 percent in the first half of this year and is expected to remain soft for the rest of 2025, much lower than the median of FOMC participants' estimates of longer-run GDP growth. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is 4.1 percent, near the Committee's longer-run estimate, and total inflation is close to our target at just slightly above 2 percent if we put aside tariff effects that I believe will be temporary. Taken together, the data imply the policy rate should be around neutral, which the median FOMC participant estimates is 3 percent, and not where we are\u00e2\u0080\u00941.25 to 1.50 percentage points above 3 percent.\nMy final reason to favor a cut now is that while the labor market looks fine on the surface, once we account for expected data revisions, private-sector payroll growth is near stall speed, and other data suggest that the downside risks to the labor market have increased. With underlying inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate.\nI fully respect the views of my colleagues on the FOMC that suggest we need to take a \"wait and see\" approach regarding tariffs' effects on inflation. There is nothing wrong about having different views about how to interpret incoming data and using different economic arguments to predict how tariffs will impact the economy. These differences are a sign of a healthy and robust policy discussion.\nBut, I believe that the wait and see approach is overly cautious, and, in my opinion, does not properly balance the risks to the outlook and could lead to policy falling behind the curve. The price effects from tariffs have been small so far, and since we will likely not get clarity on tariff levels or their ultimate impact on the economy over the course of the next several months, it is possible that the labor market falters before that clarity is obtained\u00e2\u0080\u0094if it ever is obtained. When labor markets turn, they often turn fast. If we find ourselves needing to support the economy, waiting may unduly delay moving toward appropriate policy.\nMy position does not mean I believe the FOMC should reduce the policy rate along a predetermined path. We can cut now and see how the data evolves. If the tariff effects do not lead to a major shock to inflation, the Committee can continue reducing the rate at a moderate pace. If we do get significant upside surprises to inflation and employment, we can pause. But I see no reason that we should hold the policy rate at its current level and risk a sudden decline in the labor market.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            August 01, 2025",

I am pleased, though not surprised, to see such great interest in the topic of today's conference\u00e2\u0080\u0094the integrated review of the capital framework for large banks. I want to thank Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman for having the great idea of holding this event at the outset of her term. I would also like to thank Fed staff for their tireless work in putting the conference together.\nToday we will hear the perspectives of industry veterans, academics, and current and former policymakers who are all well-versed in the operations of large banks and the main pillars of the capital framework. A great benefit of this conference is the chance to consider all elements of the capital framework in concert, rather than look at each in isolation. We need to ensure that all the different pieces of the capital framework work together effectively. Doing so will help maintain a safe, sound, and efficient banking system, for the benefit of the people we serve. The U.S. bank capital framework includes risk-based capital requirements, leverage requirements, the surcharge for the largest and most complex banks, and the stress tests. We will discuss the status of each of those elements, and the road ahead, in a comprehensive manner. As this audience will know, we have proposals outstanding or in the works across all four areas.\nOur regulatory capital framework and all banking rules are implemented through supervision, an area where Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman brings deep experience as a former banker and state supervisor. As she has noted, we need to make sure that our supervisory practices focus on the critical areas that determine safety and soundness. We need our large banks to be well capitalized and to manage their key risks well. And we need large banks to be free to compete with one another, with nonbank financial firms, and with banks in other jurisdictions to provide capital and support economic growth.\nThe Fed is a dynamic institution. We are open to hearing new ideas and feedback on how to improve the capital framework for large banks, and I look forward to hearing from today's participants. Thank you again for joining us today.\nRelated Content\nIntegrated Review of the Capital Framework for Large Banks Conference\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            July 22, 2025",

Waller\nAt the Money Marketeers of New York University, New York, New York\nShare\nThank you, John, and thank you for the invitation to speak to you today.\nMy purpose this evening is to explain why I believe that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should reduce our policy rate by 25 basis points at our next meeting.\n1\nI used to tell my junior research colleagues that presentations are not murder mysteries\u00e2\u0080\u0094just tell the audience up front \"who did it\" by telling them the main point. So let me follow my own advice and state up front the reasons I believe we should cut the policy rate at our meeting in two weeks.\nFirst, tariffs are one-off increases in the price level and do not cause inflation beyond a temporary surge. Standard central banking practice is to \"look through\" such price-level effects as long as inflation expectations are anchored, which they are.\nSecond, a host of data argues that monetary policy should be close to neutral, not restrictive. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was likely around 1 percent in the first half of this year and is expected to remain soft for the rest of 2025, much lower than the median of FOMC participants' estimates of longer-run GDP growth. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is 4.1 percent, near the Committee's longer-run estimate, and headline inflation is close to our target at just slightly above 2 percent if we put aside tariff effects that I believe will be temporary. Taken together, the data imply the policy rate should be around neutral, which the median of FOMC participants estimates is 3 percent, and not where we are\u00e2\u0080\u00941.25 to 1.50 percentage points above 3 percent.\nMy final reason to favor a cut now is that while the labor market looks fine on the surface, once we account for expected data revisions, private-sector payroll growth is near stall speed, and other data suggest that the downside risks to the labor market have increased. With inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate.\nLet me explain my reasoning by starting with my view of economic activity. Given the ups and downs of monthly indicators of GDP this year, we can best get a view of the performance of the economy by combining the first- and second-quarter numbers. With the data in hand, estimates suggest that real GDP increased at an annual rate of about 1 percent in the first half of this year, compared with 2.8 percent in the second half of 2024. That comparison is important not only for the extent of the slowdown, which is considerable, but also because it is well below most estimates of the potential growth rate of the economy. Based on forward-looking indicators, I don't expect a rebound in the second half\u00e2\u0080\u0094in fact, most forecasts suggest that real GDP growth will remain around 1 percent at an annual rate. While the recent tax bill has a significant number of elements that will spur economic growth in the future, not much of those effects will show up this year.\nThe slowdown in GDP is evident in consumer spending, which constitutes about two-thirds of economic activity. After hovering near 3 percent last year, real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) growth is estimated to have stepped down to 1 percent in the first half of this year. This morning the Commerce Department announced June retail sales. The data are consistent with this forecast, as the increase is on the heels of a couple of soft monthly readings. As we move forward this year, consumer spending is expected to continue to grow at a similar pace, tempered by the expected slowing in growth of real disposable income because of the temporary effects of tariff increases. I will say more about tariffs when I discuss inflation, but in assessing the near-term momentum of the economy, tariffs could well be a factor.\nTurning to the \"soft\" data, this picture of declining momentum is consistent with what I am hearing from my business contacts and other sources. The Fed's July 16th Beige Book reported mixed evidence on economic activity across Federal Reserve Districts, with 5 reporting slight or modest gains and the remaining 7 having flat or declining activity.\n2\nThis mixed news is also found in surveys of purchasing managers where there is a continuing contraction in manufacturing and a slight expansion in nonmanufacturing activity. Given that firms outside manufacturing represent the large majority of businesses, this implies a modest expansion in activity.\nNow let's talk about the labor market. The headline numbers from the June jobs report looked reassuring\u00e2\u0080\u0094the unemployment rate stands at 4.1 percent, within the range it has been for the past year, and payroll gains were reported as 147,000, essentially the same as in May. But looking a little deeper, I see reasons to be concerned. Half of the payroll gain came from state and local government, a sector of employment that is notoriously difficult to seasonally adjust this time of year. In contrast, private payroll employment grew just 74,000, a much smaller gain than in the previous two months, and that is consistent with other surveys you might have read about that found a drop in private-sector employment.\n3\nI focus on private-sector employment not only because it is the lion's share of employment, but also because it is a better guide to the cyclical movement in employment than counting public and private sector together. As I used to tell my students, the Federal Reserve's job should be to maximize private-sector employment, not government employment.\nAnd there is another reason to cite the slowdown in private-sector hiring. A pattern in data revisions in recent years tells us that the private payroll data are being overestimated and will be revised down significantly when the benchmark revision occurs in early 2026. Accounting for the anticipated revision to the level of employment in March 2025 and extrapolating forward, private-sector employment gains last month were much closer to zero.\n4\nThis is why I say private-sector payroll gains are near stall speed and flashing red.\nThis is only one month of data, I realize, and one possible factor in the slowdown in private-sector hiring could be a deceleration in net immigration this year, although it will take time to get a clear picture of how immigration is affecting employment. But other data support the idea of a slowdown in hiring. There are widespread media reports of the difficulty new college graduates are encountering in finding jobs, and, in fact, the unemployment rate for new grads is at a 10-year high, far above the level before the pandemic.\n5\nLooking across the soft and hard data, I get a picture of a labor market on the edge. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey reports continued low rates of firing but also low rates of hiring. I suspect this is a hangover of a labor market that was very tight after the pandemic, leaving employers resistant to let go of qualified workers for fear of renewed labor shortages. That said, purchasing managers report caution and even some pauses on hiring. The June 4th Beige Book reported declining labor demand in every single Federal Reserve District, and the July 16th Beige Book emphasized that labor demand continued to be less than labor supply in many industries. With hiring already low, at a certain point, declining demand would overcome any instinct to hold on to workers, and if that attitude does shift, it implies that a larger and more sudden reduction in payrolls and an increase in the unemployment rate are a risk.\nTo sum up here, I see the hard and soft data on economic activity and the labor market as consistent: The economy is still growing, but its momentum has slowed significantly, and the risks to the FOMC's employment mandate have increased.\nLet's turn to the inflation data. In the past two days, we received June consumer and producer price data that give us a good idea of the inflation rate based on PCE, the FOMC's benchmark for monetary policy. After several months of readings that moved the 12-month inflation rate closer to the FOMC's target, the consumer price index and the producer price index suggest that total PCE inflation moved up to around 2.5 percent in June, and core inflation likewise rose to roughly 2.7 percent. I believe these data reflect some modest effect from tariff increases, which began in February, and I believe there are further tariff-induced increases to inflation to come later this year, with the asterisk that there remains a lot of uncertainty about how trade agreements or escalations in trade conflicts may affect that outcome.\nTo understand how tariffs are affecting prices, I have been following not only the Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly data, but also studies of high frequency price data. For example, some researchers this year are tracking the short-run price impact of tariffs on goods prices in real time by examining product-level price data from online stores of large U.S. retailers.\n6\nUsing data through mid-July, they find that, on net, imported goods prices have increased modestly while domestic goods prices are little changed. Looking across country of origin, Chinese goods imports have seen the most persistent and steady price increases. That said, to date, the data point to very small goods price increases relative to the size of the tariff rates.\nThis finding is consistent with my view that a large share of tariff increases won't be passed through to consumers. My presumption has been that consumers will have to pay about one-third of the price increases from higher tariffs, with the remainder split between foreign suppliers and U.S. importers. So if there is a permanent increase to import tariffs of about 10 percent, I expect this will raise PCE inflation three-tenths of 1 percent this year, and that this increase would fade over the next year or so.\n7\nI can think of a couple of other reasons that may limit the impact on consumers. The first is that the slowing down of the rollout of many tariffs, with multiple postponements for continuing negotiations, may be giving U.S. importers time to substitute finished or intermediate goods to domestic suppliers or foreign sources subject to lower tariffs. A second reason is that, faced with the slowing economy that I have described and the likelihood that tariffs will be weighing on consumer spending, foreign producers and importers may be finding ways to hold the line on prices to maintain their presence on store shelves and hold on to customers. In fact, slowing demand increases competition for all firms, and consumers may benefit. Finally, despite all of the discussion of supply chain disruptions, tariff effects on supply chains are completely different than what happened during the pandemic. In the pandemic, supply chains were actually broken: Many workers were not working, factories were idle, and waves of COVID were hitting at asynchronous times across the globe. In contrast, in the case of the higher tariffs, we know exactly where things are being produced, and nothing is broken\u00e2\u0080\u0094firms are simply arguing about prices and who will eat the tariffs. Once that gets resolved, goods will flow naturally across the globe but potentially using different routes.\nIt is possible, of course, that tariffs may have a larger effect on inflation than I expect, but that won't affect my view of the implications for monetary policy. As I have said many times, tariff increases are a one-time boost to prices that do not sustainably increase inflation. In the absence of an unanchoring of inflation expectations and an acceleration of wage growth, which we have not seen, tariffs won't and can't permanently increase the inflation rate. What does this mean for monetary policy? Research shows that central bankers should\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, in fact, do\u00e2\u0080\u0094look through price-level shocks to avoid needlessly tightening policy in times like these and damaging the economy.\n8\nThe key question for monetary policy right now is what we can discern about the underlying rate of inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, the rate excluding tariffs\u00e2\u0080\u0094based on the fundamentals of the economy. Federal Reserve Board staff has done work to try to estimate tariff effects on PCE prices.\n9\nUsing that methodology, if I subtract estimated tariff effects from the reported inflation data, I find the inflation numbers for the past few months would have been quite close to our 2 percent goal. You're not going to hear \"mission accomplished\" from me, but what this tells me is that underlying inflation has been lower than what is reported and close to our objective.\nBesides tariffs, I don't expect an undesirable, sustained increase in inflation from other forces. Among the reasons for this are that the rate of growth in labor compensation is down considerably in the past year or two, and, with the softening labor market, I do not expect workers will be able to get large wage increases going forward. Combining this with solid rates of productivity growth implies inflation should continue around 2 percent.\nTwo more points support my inflation outlook, and I will only summarize them here since I discussed them at length in my June outlook speech.\n10\nThe first addresses the question of whether I could be making the same kind of mistake my FOMC colleagues and I made in 2021 and 2022 in expecting inflation increases to be only transitory when they turned out to be persistent. But unlike then, there is no pandemic disrupting labor, goods, and services supply around the world, and economic growth is now slow and slowing, rather than expanding rapidly. These differences bring me to the second point, which is that unlike in 2021 and 2022, when expectations of future inflation rose, today the measures of expectations I watch remain firmly anchored.\n11\nTo sum up, tariffs have boosted, and will continue to boost, inflation a bit above the FOMC's 2 percent objective this year, but policy should look through tariff effects and focus on underlying inflation, which seems to be close to the FOMC's 2 percent goal, and I do not see any concern for forces driving it persistently higher.\nAs I hope will be evident by now, the evidence of a slowing economy, and all the factors I have cited weighing on economic activity, mean that the risks to the FOMC's employment mandate are greater, and sufficient to warrant an adjustment in the stance of monetary policy. Based on June's Summary of Economic Projections, the current target range for the federal funds rate of 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent is 125 to 150 basis points above the participants' median estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate of 3 percent.

Cook\nAt the National Bureau of Economic Research, Summer Institute 2025: Digital Economics and Artificial Intelligence, Cambridge, Massachusetts\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Avi. It is an honor to be back with you at the NBER Summer Institute. Thanks to you, Erik, and Catherine for organizing these insightful and thought-provoking sessions this summer.\n1\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is advancing across the globe and permeating every corner of the economy at an incredibly rapid rate. This has significant implications for Federal Reserve leaders, both as policymakers and managers of the organization. AI is transforming the economy, including by accelerating how quickly we generate ideas and making workers more efficient, and that, in turn, will affect both sides of our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. AI also is beginning to affect the way we conduct economic research within the Federal Reserve System, with the potential to make some tasks more efficient, harness nontraditional data in new ways, and broaden and deepen economic analysis.\nI believe we are at an inflection point. As I have stated before, I, like some of you here today, see AI as the next general-purpose technology (GPT)\n2\n. As many of you in this room know and have written about, GPTs, like the printing press or electric power, matter immensely to innovation.\n3\nSimilar to those seminal advances, AI will likely spread throughout the economy more broadly, spark innovation, and improve over time.\nAmong large language models (LLMs), the highest scores on benchmark intelligence tests have almost doubled over the past 12 months, according to the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index.\n4\nThe competition to improve is fierce: The leaderboard for the AI lab offering the best model switched six times in the past half a year. And the technology is diffusing rapidly. ChatGPT launched about three years ago, and now more than half a billion users engage with the internet-based LLM weekly.\n5\nLLMs are super cool and grab the headlines, but there is a lot more to AI, which can be an important driver of productivity. Advances in multimedia generation is another way to think of AI's fast advancement. It took human creators decades to move from silent pictures to \"talkie\" movies; AI models accomplished this advance in less than a year.\nAI is poised to alter the contours of the global economy. In doing so, it has the potential to materially affect both sides of the Fed's dual mandate. On the maximum-employment side of the mandate, AI can generate new tasks and jobs and possibly eliminate others, similar to many past technological innovations. On the price-stability side of our mandate, AI can improve productivity, which can lower inflationary pressures, but it can also boost prices in the interim, as AI adoption may lead to a surge in aggregate investment. Studying the net effects of AI on the economy over time will be critical to setting appropriate monetary policy. However, at the Fed, we are not only considering AI's implications for the economy but also employing strategies to harness the technology's power inside our walls.\nCommensurate with rapid improvements in AI, its adoption is accelerating across government and industry. As a result, there is an urgency for the Fed to both study AI's effects and capture more of its benefits to maintain a highly productive workforce and extract additional insights from new economic analysis.\nHaving spent much of my career studying the innovation production function and collecting and examining data on the economic effects of technology, productivity, and innovation, I am coupling caution with this optimism. This is consistent with my view when I was a research associate here at NBER and when I first spoke about AI at the NBER AI meeting in Toronto in 2018 before I joined the Board of Governors. While I see AI adoption as broadly beneficial to the economy and society, I know from economic history and the history of technology that there could be many multidimensional challenges to adopting it. With that in mind, I will start by offering general principles I believe guide our society's engagement with AI. Next, I will describe recent progress on AI research at the Fed. I will then say a bit about both the opportunities and constraints I see affecting the wider adoption of AI. Finally, I will offer some brief remarks on how AI factors into my thinking on monetary policy.\nResponsible AI Adoption\nI want to start by stressing that any organization engaging with this technology should take a thoughtful and structured approach to AI adoption. I can offer four guiding principles for what I view as responsible AI adoption.\nFirst and foremost is establishing strong governance and risk management. A central tenet of good governance should be the mindset that humans are in the loop, because it ensures that people guide AI rather than allow AI to guide us. In a speech last year, I told a story about how Benjamin Franklin lost a game of chess to a machine called the \"Mechanical Turk\"\n6\nOf course, there was a human chess master hidden inside. What might seem like a silly tale contains an important lesson for organizations and governments deploying AI: Like the Mechanical Turk, ultimately the human inside the machine is still in charge. Relatedly, organizations also must be careful about privacy, cybersecurity, and leakage of confidential and internal information.\nA second principle is that education and training of staff are critical to get and keep employees at the technological frontier. A third principle is empowerment. Teams within organizations should be encouraged to learn by doing and engage hands-on with AI technologies in controlled environments. Finally, a fourth principle is experimentation. Organizations should maintain a spirit of openness while retaining the ability to halt projects that do not meet rigorous standards.\nAI Research at the Fed\nLike many other leading organizations and researchers around the world, the Federal Reserve is working hard to understand AI's implications for our mission and our own work. To be clear, the FOMC is not using AI in developing or setting policy, but rather to aid staff in their other tasks such as writing, coding, and research. For example, we have been deepening our understanding of the capabilities of LLMs and other machine learning models to produce economic insights.\n7\nSeveral Fed papers document what we are learning. Board economists Wendy Dunn and Nitish Sinha, with coauthors Ellen Meade and Raakin Kabir found that LLMs have surprisingly good understanding of economic topics discussed in the FOMC minutes.\n8\nIn a recent paper, Board economist Paul Soto measured AI research and development by examining firms' earnings conference calls using deep learning.\n9\nRichmond Fed economist Anne Hansen, with coauthors, John Horton, Sophia Kazinnik, Daniela Puzzello and Ali Zarifhonarvar found partial success in simulating the Survey of Professional Forecasters' panel using an LLM and create synthetic forecasters that often achieve superior accuracy, particularly at medium- and long-term horizons.\n10\nA paper by Mary Chen, Matthew DeHaven, Isabel Kitschelt, Seung Jung Lee, and Martin Sicilian used machine learning techniques on a variety of unstructured textual data to identify and forecast financial crises.\n11\nAnother paper, by Leland Crane, Emily Green, Molly Harnish, Will McClennan, Paul Soto, Betsy Vrankovich, and Jacob Williams, harnessed the ability of an open-weight model to read Work Adjustment and Retraining Notifications to create a real-time measure of layoffs.\n12\nAs our researchers examine LLMs and other machine learning techniques critically, some research has demonstrated the benefits of AI, and other research has provided important insights about its limits and where we should be careful about AI.\nBy actively engaging with and learning about AI tools in our research, we not only enhance our analytical capabilities, but also gain invaluable insights into the broader economic implications of AI. Researchers at the Fed are also examining the state of AI adoption and the potential of AI to affect our economy. A timely indicator of generative AI (GenAI) adoption in the U.S. has been developed by St. Louis Fed economist Alexander Bick, along with his coauthors Adam Blandin and David Deming, through a repeated survey.\n13\nThey also find that, so far, GenAI adoption for uses outside of work has been faster than personal computer (PC) adoption after its introduction. In the workplace, they find GenAI adoption has happened at a similar pace as occurred with PCs. Work from David Byrne and Paul Soto, along with coauthors Martin Baily and Aidan Kane, suggests that GenAI has the potential to be a GPT and could benefit the economy in other ways too such as by being an invention that itself leads to more innovation.\n14\nIn addition, Fed staff from across our divisions keep abreast with the rapid developments in GenAI by engaging regularly with other researchers and experts from academia, other central banks, and the industry through various seminars, workshops, interviews, and invited presentation series.\nSimultaneously, the research at the Fed is proceeding deliberately and cautiously, as many AI tools are not yet ready to be put into production. For example, Leland Crane, Akhil Karra and Paul Soto show that when it comes to real-time analysis, LLMs suffer from look-ahead bias and frequently get confused by the vintage nature of economic data releases.\n15\nEven for historical analysis, the researchers note: \"From the perspective of historical analysis, an LLM may not reliably recall the details of real time data flow during historical episodes, limiting the reliability of historical analysis.\"\nThe Speed of Adoption\nOur experience with AI at the Fed is also informative about why we are not seeing more widespread adoption of AI in the economy, despite its remarkable pace of improvement and the apparently large potential economic gains.\nFirst, as in all industries grappling with AI, the workforce must be trained to take advantage of a rapidly changing technology that is strikingly different from previous technologies. Often, the premise of technology has been to automate routine tasks where the steps involved are predetermined. The premise of AI is different from technologies of the past. AI promises to augment areas of work involving human judgement, which do not follow any predetermined steps. Thus, education and training must evolve.\nSecond, large organizations learn to use new tools through hands-on experimentation and shared experiences, and it takes time for the knowledge to diffuse. Some of these are planned and organized, while others are more organic and spontaneous. For example, earlier this year, the Board hosted an AI expo where AI early adopters shared their experiences with AI and innovative AI use cases. Events such as this showcase cross-functional, cross-organizational collaboration among participants throughout the Federal Reserve System and demonstrate how AI-driven solutions could address challenges in areas such as economic analysis, financial stability, and operations. These venues provide excellent avenues for sharing successes and failures in trying out different use cases and, in many cases, enable the broader community to engage with prototypes of AI applications. In addition to demystifying AI and encouraging its use, these events try to establish and promote cultural norms of responsible AI usage, which generates ideas related to the types of problems AI is better or worse at solving.\nFinally, organizations will also have a rational desire to be selective about which advances to adopt when the technology is rapidly changing. For example, we are seeing that some highly effective prompting strategies for older models are no longer necessary for thinking models. As with any new general-purpose technology, there is likely to be an extended period of learning by doing. This will be particularly important for the high-profile LLM models. With these models, even the developers are not fully aware of their capabilities, and organizations, including the Fed, learn about their abilities and limitations only once they are put to use.\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nGiven what we know, as well as what we learn from researchers like you, we are thinking carefully about the implications of AI for monetary policy. As AI filters through the economy, it has the potential to affect both sides of our dual mandate in different ways.\nAs with other technological innovations, AI is poised to reshape our labor market, which in turn could affect our notion of maximum employment or our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment. I see it as likely that AI will allow workers to be more productive while also changing the tasks associated with any given job. As with many technological breakthroughs, a certain set of jobs may be replaced. We must recognize the challenges and potential pain this may bring, and we are watching this closely. A successful response to these disruptions will be of paramount importance but lies outside the mandate of monetary policy. Fortunately, new types of employment, whether tasks or occupations, are also being created.\nIn terms of price stability, AI is likely to boost productivity and could help the economy achieve higher growth while reducing inflationary pressures, because those productivity improvements can counter labor cost increases. In addition, the ability of AI to process and analyze ever larger amounts of data will likely lead to advances in scientific research and innovation, resulting in an increased arrival rate of ideas, further amplifying its effect on productivity. As I have noted in recent speeches, it is possible that the disinflationary effect of AI could, over time, counter any factors putting upward pressure on inflation.\n16\nIt is also possible that AI could boost prices in the interim, as adoption of the technology might require a surge in aggregate investment.\nI am constantly monitoring incoming data, the ever-evolving outlook, and a broad range of risks to both sides of the dual mandate. I tend to be cautiously optimistic when I anticipate what AI could bring to the economy, but much uncertainty remains. As I have laid out for my institution specifically and the economy broadly, AI is a technology that is rapidly evolving, and it is good to be humble about our understanding of its exact effects on our economy and the timing of those effects.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, I see us at a moment of inflection where AI is being deployed as a general-purpose technology.

Kugler\nAt the Housing Partnership Network Symposium, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Robin. And thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today on the important topic of housing and how housing fits in with the broader economy.\n1\nFirst, I want to step back and say that housing\u00e2\u0080\u0094our homes\u00e2\u0080\u0094has a central role in our lives beyond what statistical reports capture. Housing matters greatly for our welfare because shelter is a basic human necessity. Our homes\u00e2\u0080\u0094be it city apartments, farmhouses passed through generations, or suburban dwellings\u00e2\u0080\u0094are among the most significant places in our lives. In terms of household finances, housing is an important source of wealth for many American families. Housing also supports access to good jobs, because the jobs people can take depend on where they live and how far they need to commute.\nIn addition, the housing sector matters a great deal to the economy as a whole, and it is an important channel through which monetary policy is transmitted. That is why I study it closely as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). From the perspective of the labor market, many workers have ties to housing-related sectors, including construction, real estate, and the mortgage finance industry. And because housing is a large fraction of household wealth, the housing market influences consumer spending. From the price-stability perspective, shelter has a large weight in measures of inflation. Specifically, shelter is currently 16 percent of the expenditures in the basket used to calculate the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the FOMC's preferred inflation measure.\n2\nToday I will discuss several aspects of housing affordability in the U.S., a topic that I know is important to many of you, as it is to me. When studying affordability, it is important to distinguish between the cost of shelter, by which I mean the cost of occupying a home, and the costs of purchasing and owning a home. I will discuss each of these in turn, with the common theme being that both are elevated from a historical perspective. Next, I will discuss some supply and demand factors that explain how we got to this point and offer some thoughts on how these influences might evolve. Finally, I will discuss my overall outlook of the U.S. economy and its implications for monetary policy.\nCost of Shelter\nI will start with a discussion of the cost of shelter, which is not only needed for survival, but is also a large portion of household budgets. Because of this, increases in shelter prices leave less for families to spend otherwise. It is common to measure the price of shelter with rents because rent reflects the price of occupying a home. Rents surged early in the pandemic recovery, rising 8.3 percent over the 12 months ending in December 2022. This year, rent growth eased to 3.8 percent over the 12 months ending in May.\n3\nThe recent increase in multifamily construction has contributed to this moderation. For lower-end properties, we have not seen as much of a cooling in rental inflation, in part because new construction has been aimed at the high end of the market. Even with the slowdown in rent growth, rents continue to rise faster than overall inflation, as was the case before the pandemic.\n4\nNevertheless, rents have not risen at a faster pace than household incomes. The constant-quality cost of a rental unit relative to the median family income is currently no higher than its average from 2014 to 2019. The share of renters spending more than 30 percent of their income on rent was about the same in 2023 as it was in 2019, about 40 percent in both years. Of course, this fraction is high, indicating that rental housing is a large expense for many families. This ratio is significantly higher for certain groups. In 2023, 43 percent of Hispanic households spent more than 30 percent of their income on rent, while 47 percent of Black households spent that share. For households whose head did not attend college, the figure is 46 percent.\n5\nCost of Homeownership\nWhile shelter is a necessity, homeownership is an opportunity because it is a pathway for families to build wealth. It also provides a greater sense of stability because owner-occupants do not have to worry about a landlord deciding not to renew the lease. Like renting, the costs of purchasing and owning a house are elevated.\nThe cost of homeownership is related to several factors. One is the cost of purchasing a home. Like rent, house price growth has slowed from the fast pace seen a few years ago, and this slowing has been more pronounced for higher-priced homes. Zillow's index for high-value homes increased 1 percent per year over the past three years, whereas it increased 3 percent per year for low-value homes.\n6\nDespite this slowdown, the level of prices is quite high, even relative to income. The ratio of house prices to median family income is about 20 percent higher than its average from 2014 to 2019.\nIn addition, the costs associated with owning a home are also elevated. Mortgage rates have ranged between 6 and 7.5 percent in the past several years. Property taxes have risen along with home values. Homeowners insurance premiums have increased as insurers seek to offset expenditures tied to recent natural disasters and the rising cost of replacing structures. Federal Reserve Board staff research shows that, factoring in high house prices, mortgage rates, property taxes, and homeowners' insurance, the costs of owning a home relative to median income in 2023 were at the highest level seen since 1980.\n7\nGiven these costs, it is no surprise that some families cannot afford a home. Board staff research shows that increases in mortgage rates reduce purchases by lower-income borrowers, especially low-income first-time homebuyers.\n8\nAnd, indeed, the homeownership rate of heads of households younger than 45 decreased from 2022 to 2024. This decline is a partial reversal of changes seen in the previous few years when a combination of very low interest rates and fiscal support caused ownership rates to rise. Yet, on net, the ownership rate for several groups remains above levels recorded before the pandemic. In 2024, homeownership rates for household heads aged 35 to 44 were 62 percent, 2 percentage points above their 2019 level. The ownership rates for Black households were 4 percentage points higher, and the rate for Hispanic households was 1.5 percentage points higher.\n9\nDemand Factors\nThe relative affordability of housing is the outcome of the forces of supply and demand. Let me first focus on the long-run trends on the demand side, where household growth\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, the change in the number of households over time\u00e2\u0080\u0094plays an important role. Household growth is a function of population growth and household size. In the 10 years before the pandemic, the U.S. population rose slightly less than 1 percent a year. Immediately following the pandemic, population grew at a faster rate, reflecting a higher volume of immigration. That trend has since reversed. Academic research examining immigration flows finds that rent growth increases in the short run after a wave of immigration, but these rent increases may not persist if the housing supply expands over time to meet the increase in housing demand.\n10\nIn fact, a study found that increases in immigration do lead to more residential construction.\n11\nIn terms of the whole population, the Census Bureau projects that population growth will ease over the next 10 years but remain positive, based on mortality rates, birth rates, and the age distribution of the population.\n12\nThus, population growth should put less upward pressure on demand for housing going forward.\nLet me turn to some cyclical forces on the housing demand side, with some factors pushing demand in opposite directions. A strong labor market for several years has fueled demand for both renting and owning housing, while the recent increase in mortgage rates and other costs of ownership have damped demand for owning.\nSupply Factors\nTurning to housing supply, it is no surprise to those in this room that it has been increasing at too slow of a rate relative to demand. Research shows that growth of the housing stock has declined steadily since the 1960s and 1970s. Specifically, it estimates that if the housing stock had expanded at the same rate from 2000 to 2020 as it did from 1980 to 2000, there would be 15 million more housing units in the U.S.\n13\nResearch finds that local regulations are an important factor constraining the housing supply, leading to higher house prices.\n14\nIn response, some state and local governments have begun to enact policy changes aimed at relaxing these supply restrictions. For example, in 2020 Minneapolis enacted a large-scale zoning reform that eliminated parking requirements for new development, encouraged apartment development in commercial corridors, and permitted duplex and triplex construction on all residential lots. These zoning reforms may have boosted construction in Minneapolis. Other states and cities have also implemented policies intended to increase the number of housing units, but it is still too early to tell whether these changes will meaningfully affect house prices or rents.\nMaterial and labor costs for home construction have increased about 25 percent in real terms since the mid-2000s.\n15\nRecent policy changes at the national level could further increase those costs. Anecdotal reports, including those in the Beige Book, suggest that changes in immigration policy are starting to restrict the supply of construction workers. Research has found that past declines in immigration have reduced residential construction while increasing housing prices.\n16\nIn terms of tariff policy changes, to date there has been some effect on homebuilder costs. The National Association of Home Builders estimates tariff policy, including tariffs on steel and aluminum, has increased the cost of new construction by about 3 percent of the average price of a new home, and additional tariffs, such as the one proposed on imported lumber, could raise construction costs further.\nAnother aspect of housing supply is the number of homes for sale. Elevated interest rates have made it much less appealing for existing owners who have a mortgage with a low fixed rate to sell and purchase a different house, because doing so would require them to take out a new mortgage at a much higher rate. Therefore, the supply of existing homes for sale in the past few years has been much lower than normal. Board staff research shows that this \"rate lock-in\" effect has boosted house prices in markets that were already tight in 2019, because the decrease in homes for sale was proportionally larger than the decrease in the number of potential buyers.\n17\nConsidering all these factors in concert, the housing market has gone through some pronounced swings over the past four years. Looking through these ups and downs, growth in demand for shelter has continued to outpace supply, putting upward pressure on rents across a wide range of locations and types of families. Although rent growth has not been faster than income growth, rental expenditures are still a large fraction of income for many households. House prices have risen, too, and combined with elevated mortgage rates and increases in other ownership costs, the costs of owning a home are high relative to Americans' incomes.\nLooking forward, growth in housing demand may soften over the second half of this decade because of a slowdown in population growth. But even with this softening, it is not clear that growth in the housing supply will be large enough to meet demand. Prospects for house prices and rents over the next few years also depend materially on the economic outlook, to which I will turn now.\nEconomic Outlook\nI will start by saying that while my discussion so far has focused on the housing market, I look at economic conditions across the entire economy and in every region of the country when making monetary policy decisions. Thus, I pursue the monetary policy that I believe will achieve our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability for all Americans.\nOverall, I see the labor market as stable and resilient, and economic activity moderating some. In contrast, I see upward pressure on inflation from trade policies, and I expect additional price increases later in the year. While I am monitoring policy developments in many areas, I continue to see trade developments as the key drivers of the U.S. economic outlook.\nStarting with price stability, based on data received this week, it is estimated that the headline PCE price index rose 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in June, a somewhat stronger gain than the 2.3 percent recorded in May. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs and is a good guide for future inflation, came in at about 2.8 percent in June, also higher than in May. Both headline and core inflation have shown no progress in the last six months. While core services inflation decreased relative to the end of last year, core goods inflation has pushed up inflation recently.\nI see firmer core goods inflation as already partially reflecting the pass-through of increased tariffs, which has been shown by research done at the Fed.\n18\nIn addition, CPI and PPI reports released in the past two days show that increases in core goods prices were more broad-based in the month of June. While many forecasters may have been expecting a sooner and sharper increase in overall inflation, there are many reasons to think that larger effects of tariffs are still coming. First, businesses built up inventories ahead of anticipated tariff increases, giving them leeway to still sell goods at pre-tariffed prices. Second, given the many changes in implemented tariff policies, businesses may not yet be passing the higher tariffs to their selling prices because they are waiting for greater clarity. Third, businesses, especially larger ones, may also be waiting to capture market share from others that hike prices sooner. Fourth, the current environment of still-elevated short-run inflation expectations makes it easier for workers to seek higher wages and business to charge higher prices, which could increase the persistence of price hikes going forward. Fifth, tariff rates could increase further, as seen in newly proposed reciprocal tariffs for several countries and the new tariffs on copper introduced last week, putting further upward pressure on prices.\nOther unforeseen shocks, such as geopolitical ones, may further push inflation upward soon.

Barr\nAt The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nI am here to discuss one of the most important resources that policymakers have: the lessons of history. In discharging my responsibilities at the Federal Reserve, I have been thinking a lot about history. Its study provides the opportunity to step out of the particular circumstances of today to inform our understanding of the core issues at the heart of financial regulation. While we must be attentive to new and even unprecedented challenges, experience shows that understanding the lessons of history gives policymakers a great advantage. Many of the decisions we face today have, in some form, been confronted by previous generations of policymakers.\nIn these remarks, I want to discuss a particular pattern in the history of the financial system, which is the relationship between regulatory weakening and the economic and financial cycle of booms and busts. My intent is not to re-hash well-examined facts or to go over past historical episodes chapter and verse. Rather, I aim to offer a perspective on this historical throughline that focuses on the regulatory cycle.\nIt's widely accepted that the economy and financial system experience cyclical booms and busts. Booms have historically been characterized by a multitude of good things. These can include fast economic growth, workers who had been sidelined entering the workforce and improving their lives, and financial innovations that often make credit or investments more readily available. At the same time, some of the characteristics of a boom economy, such as rapid increases in credit and in financial market activity, as well as greater risk-taking and leverage, can sow the seeds of busts. In busts, economic activity and lending contract and asset prices decline. This can lead to rapid deleveraging and dislocation throughout the financial system, which worsen the downturn, causing job losses and business closures, homes lost and lives upended.\nThere are usually multiple causes that drive booms and make busts so terrible, some unique to each individual episode. But one factor that is common to many past cycles of boom and bust is weakening financial regulation. Weakening regulation often drives risk-taking and increases bank fragility during the boom, making the ensuing bust more painful. Indeed, economic research suggests that weaker regulation leads to more bank failures, setting the stage for worse recessions.\n2\nMoreover, because the financial system evolves so rapidly, regulation must also continuously adjust. Much regulatory weakening occurs simply when regulators fail to keep pace, while at other times, there is a deliberate action to lower regulatory burden that ends up miscalculating the risk involved. Let me be clear here that, when I refer to regulatory weakening, I mean not only direct deregulatory actions by regulators or legislators, but also failure of the regulatory framework to keep up with changing circumstances.\nIn principle, financial regulation should incentivize banks to engage in responsible risk-taking and build up resources in good times, so that they can deal with times of financial stress and continue their vital role in the economy in bad times. The prosperity that accompanies a healthy economy should allow banks to invest in improved risk management and strong financial resources. However, a healthy economy can also reduce the effectiveness of regulatory constraints on bank risk-taking. This can occur for a host of reasons, including behavioral biases, political pressure, market dynamics, and the tendency for innovation to move more quickly than regulators. These dynamics can result in regulatory weakening during boom times. When actively pursued, this weakening often appears justified at the time and may be implemented by well-meaning policymakers who simply miscalculate the long-run effects of their actions.\nMy purpose in these remarks is to recount several boom-and-bust episodes in American history and identify some lessons that can guide policymakers entrusted with the responsibility of promoting a strong and stable banking system. This history demonstrates the connection between regulatory weakening and cycles of boom and bust. I don't mean to suggest that more regulation is always better or that repealing and reforming regulations isn't sometimes appropriate to remove obsolete rules and relieve unnecessary burden. But, if we can at least agree that regulation should seek to limit devastating financial crises, then the history that I will describe today offers some lessons for anyone thinking about regulatory policy.\nThere are, of course, lots of examples to choose from, both in the United States and abroad, but I'll focus on the Great Depression, the Savings and Loan (S&L) crisis, and the Global Financial Crisis. I will then discuss some possible reasons that similar episodes could recur and conclude with some thoughts on the lessons we can learn.\nThe Great Depression\nLet's start with the biggest and most widely studied bust in U.S. history, the Great Depression. Scholars continue to debate its causes, which were multiple and complex. One compelling argument focuses on the failure of regulation to keep pace with the innovations of the Roaring Twenties. As I said, I view such regulatory stagnation as a form of weakening. This weakened regulatory environment played a role in setting the stage for and then exacerbating the bust. Weakened regulation that had failed to keep up with the times left banks unable to weather shocks to the economy. The banking sector's collapse was a significant factor in making the Great Depression the most severe economic crisis that this country has ever experienced.\n3\nThe Roaring Twenties expansion was powered by the post-war recovery and technological advances in transportation, manufacturing, and communications. Stock markets grew quickly to help finance this innovation, while residential and commercial real estate investment surged and swelling demand for consumer durables led in turn to increased demand for financing.\n4\nAs credit needs escalated, there was intensifying competition among banks; savings and loan institutions (S&Ls); and rapidly growing nonbank finance companies, trust companies, and other financial vehicles.\nThe 1920s were also characterized by high levels of financial speculation, both inside and outside the banking sector. Banks engaged in speculation through nonbank affiliates and supported speculation by lending. At the same time, many banks were relatively thinly capitalized and overly concentrated, especially given the lack of federal deposit insurance at the time. In addition, many states had prohibitions on branching that prevented banks from diversifying their portfolios and inhibited local competition, keeping many struggling banks alive.\n5\nThe stock market boomed, margin lending grew dramatically, and insider trading and market manipulation were rampant.\nAs the financialization of the economy increased, the regulatory framework failed to keep up. Outdated branching restrictions remained, failing to reflect the size and dynamism of the modern economy. Banks gained permission to engage in new activities, such as real estate lending and certain activities in the securities markets; however, capital requirements and other rules were not adjusted to reflect potential increased risks from these new activities.\n6\nThe cumulative effect of these events was a significantly weakened regulatory environment and a substantial buildup in risk, without a commensurate increase in resources to allow the sector to withstand the risks posed.\nLooking back, we know that, when the economic shock hit, the banking system magnified that shock. The boom of the Roaring Twenties started to go bust in 1929, when the fast growth of the past decade turned to contraction, followed by a series of financial and banking crises. In all, approximately 9,000 of the nation's 23,000 banks failed, resulting in major losses to depositors, given the lack of federal deposit insurance, and a significant contraction in credit that deepened and lengthened the economic downturn.\n7\nNotably, banks in states that had more robust regulatory frameworks\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, those that applied higher capital requirements\u00e2\u0080\u0094had lower rates of failure.\n8\nIn response to the financial collapse in the Great Depression, Congress adopted reforms aimed at addressing risks that had driven those panics. Among these steps, Congress established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and federal deposit insurance to reduce the risk of bank runs and protect retail depositors. Congress increased regulatory oversight of banks and separated commercial and investment banking. Congress also enacted strong securities laws and created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Overall, these steps helped stabilize the financial sector and ushered in a long period of quiescence in banking.\nThe Savings & Loan Crisis\nMy second example today is the S&L crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s, which did substantial harm to millions of Americans and the financial system and was extremely expensive to resolve. In this episode, in contrast to the Great Depression, affirmative deregulation led to excessive risk-taking by S&Ls, as well as banks, during a boom period. As circumstances soured, revealing weaknesses, Congress attempted to bolster the S&L sector by loosening the regulatory framework further. This failed to resolve the underlying stress and instead further fueled the buildup in risk-taking, worsening the losses in the subsequent bust.\nLet me first set the stage. The years leading up to the S&L crisis were characterized by dramatic growth in business credit, in the course of the economic expansion that began in 1982. At the beginning of this period, the S&L sector primarily served the residential real estate market because of restrictions on S&L activities. These restrictions eased over the 1980s, allowing S&Ls to get significantly larger and engage in new kinds of lending; however, these changes were not accompanied by sufficient regulatory enhancements to account for increased risks. This expansion in S&L activity also presented new competition with commercial banks, which had themselves built up significant risks as they expanded into new activities.\n9\nAt the same time, both S&Ls and banks were increasingly under pressure due to both high inflation and high interest rates, which disrupted their funding models.\n10\nCompetition for customer funds increased dramatically, especially because of the rise of money market mutual funds, which had grown rapidly. When Congress removed outdated deposit rate caps to allow banks and S&Ls to more effectively compete for funds, it did so without implementing adequate safeguards against these institutions taking on excessive risk. This led many S&Ls to engage in increasingly risky projects to compensate for escalating funding costs. Banks also increased their deposit rates and took on more risk.\nAs vulnerabilities at S&Ls became evident, Congress, federal regulators, and the states attempted to bolster both sectors with the hope of allowing them to outgrow those weaknesses. For instance, Congress and the states reduced restrictions on S&Ls' ability to invest in commercial and consumer loans.\n11\nThese changes contributed to the boom in commercial real estate lending, which became a key source of vulnerability. In addition, Congress and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the federal S&L regulator at the time, weakened capital requirements and the enforcement of those requirements for the S&L sector.\n12\nThis allowed institutions to become weaker and poorly capitalized entities to stay afloat, leaving S&Ls as a whole badly positioned to weather adverse conditions.\nThe bust, when it came, was severe. S&L losses continued to mount throughout the 1980s. Many banks also experienced severe stress. These difficulties were amplified by an eventual decline in real estate values and problems in the agricultural and energy sectors. In 1980, there were just under 4,000 S&Ls. By 1989, that number had fallen to below 3,000, with over 500 of the remaining institutions insolvent as judged by book value. And over 1,600 banks failed between 1980 and 1994. Regulatory weakening had propped up tottering institutions, allowing zombie institutions to persist, accumulating much greater losses than they otherwise would have. The process of cleaning up the sector began in earnest in the late 1980s and continued into the mid-1990s, with a final cost of $160 billion, roughly 5 percent of gross domestic product at the time.\n13\nAnd the cost of resolving insured banks that failed during this period was $36 billion.\n14\nCongress implemented significant reforms in response to the S&L crisis, including stricter capital and accounting requirements, limits on insured depository institutions' investment powers, and expansions of regulators' enforcement authority. These changes paved the way for stability in the banking sector for some time.\nThe Global Financial Crisis\nI'll turn now to my final example, the Global Financial Crisis, which had devastating effects for the millions of people who lost their livelihoods, their homes, and their businesses.\nIn the decade leading up to the crisis, America experienced rapid credit growth and a housing boom. There was optimism about the benefits of financial innovation, such as securitization of home loans, and belief in the power of market discipline as a form of self-regulation. Home prices and mortgage debt accelerated in tandem, driven by a mutually reinforcing cycle of optimism, with home prices roughly doubling between 1997 and 2006, and even larger increases in mortgage debt.\n15\nAmid this boom, lending standards dropped, driven by investor demand for mortgage-backed securities, which were increasingly opaque and risky in their design but still highly rated by the rating agencies. There was substantial growth in the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market, including new forms of credit derivatives. Money market funds boomed, becoming increasingly linked to the off-balance sheet business of banks.\n16\nThese developments led to the emergence of large, short-funded, and interconnected financial entities\u00e2\u0080\u0094both banks and nonbanks.\nThe regulatory environment failed to keep up with these changes in activity and the increasing complexity of financial institutions and markets, and regulatory weakening heightened vulnerabilities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, enacted in 1999, permitted the creation of financial holding companies that could engage in the full range of financial ",

Working to improve financial inclusion has been an important part of my career, starting in 1995 when I joined the Treasury Department and worked with colleagues to build Community Development Financial Institutions, strengthen the Community Reinvestment Act, and launch the New Markets initiative. At the University of Michigan, financial inclusion was key to programs I worked on to support minority entrepreneurship.\nWith the support of both the public and private sectors, there have been many improvements and advancements in financial inclusion over the last three decades, evidenced by the decline in the rate of people who are unbanked and the increasing reach and success of programs such as the Bank On initiative that better meet the needs of low-income customers. I welcome this progress, but there is so much more to do to deepen and widen financial inclusion to many millions of people in America who could benefit from it. Better access to affordable financial services, geared to the needs of underserved families and entrepreneurs can help them to build more secure lives, stronger communities, and a stronger American economy.\nFinancial inclusion contributes to the Federal Reserve's mission of promoting a healthy and growing economy and a safe and stable financial system. Consumers are two-thirds of economic activity, so access to credit for low-and-moderate income households and small businesses helps the economy to grow. In addition, the Fed has an important role in implementing a series of laws passed by Congress related to access to credit, such as the Community Reinvestment Act. As we learned during the Global Financial Crisis, household finances are crucial to a strong and stable financial system.\nIn my remarks today, I would like to go through several ways that the public and private sectors are helping to increase financial inclusion. Those efforts include greater access to bank accounts and financial services, faster payments services, responsible small-dollar lending methods, and the use of alternative data to promote credit access. These efforts have shown promise in expanding financial inclusion.\nBank Account Access Is the Foundation to Financial Inclusion\nFinancial inclusion begins with access to basic bank account services. While financial services are evolving rapidly\u00e2\u0080\u0094with new forms of financial intermediation, payment services, and even deposit-like money claims\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is still the case that access to a bank account is the foundation for helping families and businesses get the financial services they need. Bank accounts provide access to direct deposit of paychecks, benefit payments and tax refunds. Bank accounts provide connections to peer-to-peer payment systems, and for the vast majority of retail and wholesale payments. Bank accounts are also often the entry point for access to credit for households and businesses.\nAccording to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's 2023\nNational Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households\n, the number of Americans without bank accounts is at the lowest it has been since the survey began in 2009. Yet, there remain groups that struggle with low account access, including those who are disabled, those without a high school diploma, and minority groups, among others. Households that include someone of working age with a disability are three times as likely to be unbanked as working-age households without a disability. Meanwhile, Hispanic and African American households and American Indian and Alaskan Native households are five and six times as likely, respectively, to be unbanked as White households.\n2\nThe unbanked cite account opening costs, unpredictable or high fees, and high minimum balance requirements as among the top reasons for not obtaining bank accounts.\n3\nExpansion of Banking Access\nOne private-sector program that has helped to address barriers to account access is the Bank On program, supported by the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund (CFEF). Bank On is led by coalitions of regional financial institutions, community groups, and local governments working together to bring households into the financial system. CFEF certifies that Bank On accounts meet standards including low minimum deposits for account opening; low maintenance, overdraft, or other unexpected fees; and free branch ATM, online, and mobile banking.\nOver 46,000 bank branches nationwide offer a certified Bank On account. An important way that the program has spread and taken root in communities is through the coalition model, which involves establishing relationships with local and state governments, public officials, and community organizations. These partners, engaged with and trusted by their communities, have helped overcome apprehension about bank accounts and helped drive the outreach needed for any business to find new customers. The Federal Reserve System has long been a partner of the Bank On Initiative. In 2006, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco was a partner in creating the first coalition. At the St. Louis Fed, the publicly available Bank On National Data Hub (BOND) was created in 2017 to help identify the availability of certified accounts. Bank On coalitions across the country continue to partner on engagement, outreach, and data collection with their regional Reserve Banks, to offer safe and affordable bank accounts.\nFaster Payments\nFinancial inclusion also requires timely access to funds. People living paycheck to paycheck incur the greatest costs of waiting for these funds. One of the primary benefits of a bank account over time is facilitating payments. Technological advances have driven improvement in this area, sometimes only incrementally, but the more recent advent of real-time payments\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially new services for instant or immediate payments\u00e2\u0080\u0094has the potential to make a big leap forward in service to households and businesses. Cash-strapped households and businesses need access to their funds right away, and they need reliable ways to pay expenses when they are due (and when they have the funds to pay them).\nLow-income households may need quick access to make just-in-time transactions, such as same-day utility bill payment through their bank or to quickly receive funds from a family member to cover an emergency expense like an unanticipated car repair. While the benefits of getting instantaneous access to paychecks are obvious, the value of controlling precisely when and in what order payments settle may be less appreciated. With real-time payments, households and businesses can have better control over payment flows, helping them, for example, to avoid unexpected and unwelcome overdraft and nonsufficient funds fees.\nMany other countries are seeking methods to improve the speed of payments. In India, for example, the implementation of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which is the country's digital instant funds transfer system, has allowed consumers to see some of these benefits in action. UPI is available for free on a customer's mobile device and can be used for merchant payments, bill payments, and money transfers, among other things. Since its implementation, the Reserve Bank of India has noted an increase in financial inclusion, particularly in rural areas where bank branch access is difficult.\n4\nWe have seen the benefits of technological advancement and innovation here in the U.S. as well. Today, technologies to improve the speed of payments are being implemented across platforms and products, providing consumers various ways to move money quickly and easily. The Federal Reserve, as a part of its mission to foster a safe, efficient, and widely accessible payments infrastructure, is playing a role as well. As we have in the past, and in collaboration with the private sector, we have worked to innovate the payment system using the latest technology to better meet the needs of businesses and households. In 2023, we launched FedNow, an interbank payment system for banks and credit unions of all sizes to instantly and securely transfer money for their customers, any time of the day, on any day of the year.\n5\nWe are encouraged by innovative private-sector engagement with the new platform and instant payment services generally. We are already seeing early adopters rolling out new services that can benefit consumers. One example is the ability for gig-economy workers to gain instant access to earned wages, which can make a big difference in household cash flow management. We expect these types of innovations will continue to expand in the coming years and be delivered in new contexts, ultimately bringing broad benefits to liquidity-constrained households and small businesses that need to tightly manage payment inflows and outflows.\nSmall-Dollar Lending\nAccess to small-dollar loans from banks can help consumers smooth through the ups and downs of income and expenses. I think many people would be surprised how widely this help is needed. According to the Fed's 2024 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, when asked how they would respond if confronted with an unexpected $400 expense, nearly 20 percent of adults said they would have paid at least in part by selling something; using a payday loan, deposit advance, or overdraft; or would not be able to pay for the expense. When looking at households with incomes of under $25,000, this number increases to 46 percent.\n6\nAccess to reasonably priced credit to cover these sorts of expenses is therefore a common need, especially among those with lower incomes. These households have no financial slack.\nIn contrast to the more costly and riskier sources of credit that I mentioned, we are seeing bank-offered products that are helping to increase access to safer, lower-cost forms of small-dollar lending. The Fed and other bank regulators took a helpful step in this regard in 2020 by issuing guidance. According to that guidance, responsible small-dollar loan programs must treat customers fairly, have effectively managed risks, and be underwritten based on prudent policies. That means, first, that products are offered in a way that most customers successfully repay their small-dollar loans in accordance with original loan terms, which is a key indicator of affordability, eligibility, and appropriate underwriting. Second, it means repayment terms, pricing, and safeguards minimize adverse customer outcomes, including cycles of debt due to rollovers or reborrowing. And finally, it means repayment outcomes and program structures enhance a borrower's financial capabilities by contributing positively to their record of servicing debts.\nMost banks that have offered small-dollar loan products since 2020 follow these principles, and it has had a positive impact on the loan terms they offer. Loan terms have better matched customer needs and rates have come down. Small-dollar loans that have the potential to disrupt the market for costly alternative financial services are bank products that provide a straightforward application process, clear loan terms, certainty about approval, strong likelihood of repayment, and quick disbursement of funds.\n7\nAlternative Financial Data\nAnother channel for improving financial inclusion is the use of alternative financial data to supplement the traditional measures that banks have relied on to judge the creditworthiness of borrowers with limited or no traditional borrowing history. For example, lenders can evaluate cash flow\u00e2\u0080\u0094steady income and bill payments\u00e2\u0080\u0094as a measure of the likelihood of loan repayment. Alternative data can help lenders take a \"second look\" for consumers who would otherwise not qualify based on the more traditional credit-score-based underwriting models. In addition to making less expensive and more suitable loans available, alternative data often allows faster loan decisions. This is an important consideration for low- and moderate-income borrowers, who tend to have little savings, and struggle with meeting an unexpected expense.\n8\nTechnological advances such as application programming interfaces (APIs), a set of specifications that can allow software to communicate with each other, can also help lenders access permissioned consumer financial data that can be used for underwriting. APIs also facilitate automated application, decisionmaking, and fund delivery.\nLet me conclude by returning to where I started, which is the crucial role of access to safe, transparent, and low-cost bank accounts as the gateway to financial inclusion. We have made great progress, but I am certain that there are still many people whose finances and lives could improve with a bank account suited to their needs and economic circumstances. I applaud the work of financial inclusion leaders in doing what they can to make bank accounts available and better tailored to the needs of low- and moderate-income households. In thinking about how to better design financial products and services, we can build on many years of behavioral financial research and practice. Thank you.\n1.

I'm very pleased to welcome you to the second annual Financial Inclusion Conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Board.\n1\nLast year, at our inaugural event, I underscored that financial inclusion is essential for creating an economy that works for everyone, with innovation in the financial sector playing an important role.\n2\nThis year's conference builds upon increased engagement across both the public and private sectors, with a collective effort to leverage technology to broaden financial service access and improve the financial well-being of consumers and small businesses. The Federal Reserve will continue to play an important role in these efforts through its research, community engagement, and regulatory approach. This work supports our ability to understand and communicate the state of financial inclusion, how banks support access to affordable financial services, and the role that our policies and practices play in promoting inclusion.\nProgress to Date\nBanks of all sizes are working to improve access to financial services for all Americans. As I've noted in the past, the U.S. banking system is well-positioned to bring consumers and small businesses into the financial mainstream by providing access to safe, fair, and responsive financial products and services.\n3\nThese efforts greatly benefit from our continued focus on broader access and innovation, including understanding how our supervisory and regulatory framework either supports or impairs a bank's ability to provide affordable financial services that are consistent with safety and soundness.\nInnovation comes in many forms. One example is through banks' use of alternative data, which can enable banks to provide services like affordable small-dollar loans or to provide access to credit invisibles who may not have access to loans and other financial services from traditional lenders.\n4\nThis growing area of focus also helps align financial service offerings with a customer's financial goals.\nA well-functioning financial system provides a foundation for strong consumer financial health. To further this, the federal banking agencies recently published a request for information on check and payments fraud to help address the impact of this growing problem on banks and their customers. I am committed to working together with a wide range of state and federal partners, including law enforcement, to address this issue.\n5\nA More Financially Inclusive Future\nAlthough there has been significant progress in providing access to financial services, there is more work left to be done. We know that financial institutions, both small and large, are working to build innovative approaches to meet their customers' needs while maintaining the safety and soundness of the banking system.\nToday's Conference\nThe theme of this year's conference is \"Unleashing a Financially Inclusive Future.\" Today, we will hear from a number of experts that will help to explore what the future might hold for financial inclusion. Our next presenter, Jo Ann Barefoot from the Alliance for Innovative Regulation, will discuss the role of banking industry innovation and policies in support of financial inclusion. Later in the day we will hear from three panels focused on topics including evolving products and practices, the role of mission-driven organizations, and how cross-border payment innovations can facilitate the movement of money around the world.\nI would like to thank you all for joining us today and I will turn it over to Art Lindo, Deputy Director and Head of Policy in the Board's Division of Supervision & Regulation, to introduce Jo Ann Barefoot.\nThank you for the opportunity to join you virtually today, and for your ongoing commitment to support a financially inclusive future.\n1.

Waller\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Dallas, Texas\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Lorie. Let me start by expressing my deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of those harmed by the flooding in the Hill Country. I cannot imagine the pain and anguish they are feeling. My prayers go out to all those affected.\nTurning to my remarks for today, thank you also for the opportunity to speak to you about the Fed's balance sheet, one of the more complex, and, I believe, misunderstood aspects of the Federal Reserve's role as a central bank.\n1\nTo level set the conversation, let me start with some simple facts. In August of 2007 our balance sheet was around $870 billion, equal to approximately 6 percent of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). Today it is around $6.7\ntrillion\n, with a\nt\n, which is about 22 percent of GDP. This is down significantly from its maximum size of nearly $9 trillion in early 2022 but still quite large. Since nominal GDP has essentially doubled since 2007, if our balance sheet had grown at the same rate, it would be around $1.7 trillion today\u00e2\u0080\u0094not $6.7 trillion.\nAn obvious question is why our balance sheet is so much larger than economic growth would have predicted. As an aside, let me point out that there is no consensus among economists about how large a central bank balance sheet should be, but it is logical to ask: if monetary policy worked when the balance sheet was 6 percent of GDP, why is it, and perhaps needs to be, proportionally so much larger now?\nA major reason is that the Federal Reserve embarked on two major balance sheet policy initiatives over the past twenty years to respond to urgent problems in the economy. First, we engaged in quantitative easing, or QE, to provide support to the economy after the advent of the Global Financial Crisis and then again with the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, we consciously changed our implementation framework for providing liquidity to the banking system by moving from a scarce-reserves system to an ample-reserves system. This change was necessary because there were shortcomings with the scarce-reserves approach\u00e2\u0080\u0094short-term rates were harder to control and required daily interventions in the markets by the Fed, and these problems were made worse when rates were at or near zero. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) explicitly stated its commitment to ample reserves in 2019, when we were gradually shrinking our balance sheet, concluding that this approach would be used over the longer-run, and it soon proved very useful when the pandemic again brought rates to zero.\n2\nAlthough these are two fundamentally different reasons for changing the size of our balance sheet, we did them more or less at the same time. This has caused confusion, with some people thinking that the Fed is choosing to keep the balance sheet larger than it needs to be. This confusion is amplified by the fact that there are external forces that have boosted the size of our balance sheet that are not under the control of the Federal Reserve. My goal today in this speech is to disentangle each of these forces and try to demystify the role of our balance sheet in conducting monetary policy. I also want to clarify issues that are currently being discussed in the public domain. I agree that the balance sheet needs to shrink but, as I will show, not by as much as some believe it should. I will also explain why the composition of the balance sheet matters as much as its size and how changes are needed there as well.\nI know from teaching this topic over the years to my undergraduate students that unless you are an accountant or a banker, you would probably rather go to the dentist than listen to a speech about the Fed's balance sheet. I hope to explain it clearly enough that you can leave here and engage in the public debate with a better understanding of the issues. To do so, the approach I want to take is the following. Suppose the Fed had never used quantitative easing and simply decided to move to an ample-reserves system from a scarce-reserves system. How would the liability and asset sides of our balance sheet change in response to this one policy decision? After addressing this question, I will then discuss how QE affects our balance sheet and also some difficult tradeoffs that arise when engaging in QE.\nThe Big Three Liabilities\nFor any balance sheet, we start with the asset and liability entries. Assets are things that are owned, and liabilities are things that are owed to others at a given point in time. I will start by listing the big three liabilities on the Fed's balance sheet and the characteristics of those liabilities. There are other types of liabilities (and capital) that must be accounted for, but they are too small to matter for the policy matters I want to discuss, so I will ignore them. After discussing these \"big three\" liabilities, we can consider what assets should be held to match those liabilities.\nThe first big liability of the Federal Reserve is currency outstanding. The Fed supplies U.S. dollars elastically to the public, based on demand, distributing dollars through banks.\n3\nThat demand, which is not controlled by the Fed, is basically determined by how fast the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0094and thus the need for cash\u00e2\u0080\u0094is growing. At the end of 2024, the amount of dollars in circulation was $2.3 trillion. That is up considerably from around $800 billion in 2007 after which the overall balance sheet began growing sharply. Even in terms of GDP, currency has increased, from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to almost 8 percent today. So, an important point that many do not realize is that the Fed's balance sheet has expanded, especially in nominal terms, from increased demand for U.S. currency.\n4\nWhat are the characteristics of currency as a liability? First, it is non-interest bearing. Second, it never \"matures\" as other debt obligations do. Let's just say that currency is different from other liabilities\u00e2\u0080\u0094it pays no interest, and you never get back your initial payment for acquiring it. If you come to the Fed and ask us to redeem a dollar bill, we will simply give you another dollar bill.\nThe second big liability is the Treasury General Account, or TGA. The Federal Reserve is the fiscal agent of the U.S. Treasury, which means that we are the bank for the U.S. government and the TGA is the Treasury's checking account. What are the characteristics of the TGA? First, it is a short-term liability that moves up and down as cash flows in and out of the account as the Treasury receives tax and other payments and pays its bills. Second, we do not pay interest to the Treasury on its account balances. Finally, given the asynchronous timing of payments and receipts, the TGA can vary significantly, especially when the debt ceiling is binding. During 2024, it generally fluctuated between about $650 billion and $950 billion, briefly peaking at around $960 billion during the April tax season. Due to this year's debt ceiling constraint, the TGA fell from its 2024 average of $780 billion to about $325 billion recently, and with the debt ceiling just increased, there will be a quick rebuild in the coming weeks. So, it is not unusual for the TGA to fluctuate by several hundred billion dollars. This situation is very different than the one in 2007 when the TGA was deliberately held steady at $5 billion each day. This change reflects both how much federal spending has grown in that time and also a shift in accounting in 2015 to holding an estimated week's worth of federal payments in the TGA\u00e2\u0080\u0094a decision made by the Treasury to better manage its cash flow.\nAn important point that applies to both currency and the TGA is that the Federal Reserve does not have control over the size of these liabilities and hasn't been responsible for their sharp increases. Together, they represent about $3 trillion of our $6.7 trillion balance sheet, or roughly 10 percent of nominal gross domestic product. So, the size of the Fed's balance sheet, which is now about 22 percent of nominal GDP, is nearly half accounted for by these two liabilities that are not under the Fed's control. Those who argue that the Fed could go back to 2007, when its total balance sheet was 6 percent of GDP, fail to recognize that these two factors make it impossible.\nThe third big liability on the Fed's balance sheet is reserves, which are the funds that depository institutions hold in accounts at the Fed. In effect, these are the checking account balances of the banking system that are held at the Federal Reserve. What is the characteristic of reserves held by banks? First, much like the TGA, they are short term in nature and very liquid\u00e2\u0080\u0094in effect like digital cash. They are the safest and most liquid asset in the financial system and used to conduct payments between banks. The reserve balances that an individual bank holds can increase or decrease, depending on the flow of payments between banks. Much like the TGA, an individual bank's reserve holdings can be volatile. But these payments do not change the total amount of reserves in the banking system\u00e2\u0080\u0094they simply transfer them from one bank to another. So, while reserve balances of individual banks can move around, total reserves are more stable, and the total amount of reserves in the system is directly controlled by the Federal Reserve. Second, in October 2008, Congress authorized the Federal Reserve to pay interest on these liabilities. Besides ending the implicit tax on banks for holding reserves, it was a step aimed at helping the Fed conduct monetary policy effectively, which it does, but it is sometimes inaccurately criticized as a giveaway to banks. I will address this point a little later. But I mention it here because the amount of reserves in the system affects the total payment flow the Fed must make to banks at the current interest rate on reserves.\nAssets Backing These Liabilities\nBy the definition of a balance sheet, these liabilities must be matched by assets held by the Federal Reserve. Let's consider matching assets to our currency liability. As I said earlier, currency pays no interest and never matures. So, we can hold assets of any maturity length to offset our liability for currency. Since currency pays no interest, any interest earned off these assets is pure profit. Given that longer-maturity assets generally pay higher interest rates and are less volatile, it seems reasonable to hold longer maturity assets against our currency liability.\nNow consider the TGA liability. We also pay no interest on the TGA. But, unlike currency, a problem with the TGA is that it can vary substantially, which makes total reserves in the system more volatile. This link to reserves is because when tax payments are made to the Treasury, we debit the payer's bank reserves and credit the Treasury's TGA account. When the Treasury makes a payment, we debit the TGA and credit the recipient bank's reserve account. Thus, volatile movements in the TGA affect the Fed's reserve management policy. There are two ways to deal with this situation: hold a buffer of reserves to ensure movements in the TGA do not affect market liquidity or hold short-maturity assets that we can expand or contract to sterilize movements in the TGA such that total reserves in the banking system are unchanged.\n5\nThe first strategy suggests the buffer stock of assets could take the form of somewhat longer maturity, while the second strategy could require holding short-term assets that can easily be bought and sold with little interest rate risk.\nThat brings us to reserves. As I mentioned, reserves are a short-maturity liability which pay interest, which suggests that the Fed should consider holding short maturity assets against this liability. Treasury bills and short-maturity Treasury notes are the safest and most liquid assets, so it would make sense to hold them against reserves. If the interest rate earned on our short maturity Treasury assets is very close to the interest we pay on reserves, then our interest earnings from the Treasury are simply passed through to the banks. In this sense, our balance sheet is just another way to transfer interest payments on Treasury securities from the Treasury to the banks.\n6\nBecause of the minimal spread between these two short-term interest rates, banks are largely indifferent to either holding reserves or the short-term Treasury securities we hold\u00e2\u0080\u0094both are highly liquid and pay roughly the same rate of return. But layer on top of this the fact that reserves are a bit more liquid than Treasury securities because banks don't have to buy or sell the Treasury securities to get reserves, and banks are willing to hold a lot of reserves. Since the Fed supplies these reserves, one might ask what it costs taxpayers to supply a large amount of reserves. From the Treasury's point of view, its interest expense is the same regardless of who holds the short-term Treasury securities. So, the Fed can provide all the liquidity that banks need at zero marginal cost, which makes me wonder why some want to make reserves scarce. I often use the following analogy to drive this point home: If governments could provide clean, safe drinking water for citizens at zero cost, why would they make it scarce?\nNow, one could ask why pay interest on reserves at all? Why not keep the interest income generated on the assets we hold to back reserves and remit it back to the Treasury? This seems like a no brainer! But there are a few reasons that interest on reserves makes sense, including the following.\nFirst, paying interest on reserves that is commensurate to the rate paid on short-term Treasury securities makes reserves attractive to banks, and holding reserves improves the functioning of the financial system by giving banks more liquidity and greater scope to settle payments in an orderly way. In contrast, if reserves bear no interest, then commercial banks will have strong incentives to avoid holding a lot of reserves, and instead hold short-term, interest-bearing assets like Treasury bills. If banks managed their liquidity only by buying and selling Treasury securities, several banks selling Treasury securities at the same time could flood the market and put undesirable upward pressure on interest rates across the economy. An ample-reserves regime where we pay interest on reserves ensures that there are enough reserves in the banking system to avoid this kind of sell off in Treasury securities, helping to stabilize the financial system without any harm to banks or their customers.\nThe second part of the case for interest on reserves is that it isn't costing taxpayers any money. As I noted earlier, whether the Fed or banks hold the Treasury securities, the T",

Barr\nAt the Policy Summit 2025: Building Strong and Sustainable Communities, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Eric, thank you to the conference organizers for asking me to speak today, and thank you, especially, to the practitioners here for the work you do in building stronger communities.\n1\nYour mission has also been at the center of my career in many different roles as an academic, a practitioner, and a public official, starting as the Treasury Department's point person on community development way back in the 1990s.\nCommunity development has been an important part of my work ever since, as a professor, a university leader, and, most recently, a banking regulator. I think this might help you understand how thrilled I am to have recently taken on the role of consumer and community development point person among the members of the Board of Governors, in support of Eric and his team and of the CD function throughout the Fed System.\nStrong and sustainable communities are crucial to the Federal Reserve's mission of promoting a healthy economy and a stable financial system. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), the Fed has a statutory obligation to supervise how banks meet the credit needs of the communities they serve, consistent with safe and sound lending practices. Our community development work reinforces the benefits of this effort. More broadly, community development work helps the Fed support a strong and healthy economy. Our primary tool for doing this is monetary policy. Monetary policy influences interest rates and financial conditions to affect economic activity. We adjust interest rates in service of seeking price stability and maximum employment for the American people.\nLet me spend just a moment on the U.S. economy and the outlook. The economy is currently on a sound footing, with low and steady unemployment, and disinflation having continued at a gradual, albeit uneven, pace toward our 2 percent target. Low-income households can ill afford increases in prices, and that's why it is so important that we bring inflation back down to our target. Looking forward, however, I expect tariffs will put upward pressure on inflation. Higher short-term inflation expectations, supply chain adjustments, and second-round effects may cause some inflation persistence. At the same time, tariffs may cause the economy to slow and unemployment to rise. Low-income workers are often hit the hardest when the job market weakens. There is still considerable uncertainty about tariff policies and their effects. Monetary policy is well positioned to allow us to wait and see how economic conditions unfold.\nTurning from monetary policy to community development, let me explain how community development also serves the goals of supporting a healthy economy that works for all Americans. While monetary policy matters a lot, other factors have to come together for people to have good job opportunities. Businesses need access to credit to expand and hire, and in many communities that credit depends on the CRA, community development financial institutions, and a range of other public policies. Businesses need qualified workers, and in many places that depends on workforce development that is supported by community development organizations. Businesses that invest to create jobs need to believe in the future and believe in the future of the communities they serve. Thriving businesses and productive workers need safe, healthy, strong, and sustainable communities. These conditions are fundamental to achieving the Federal Reserve's goals that Congress has established.\nIn Every Community\nThat is a big reason why the Fed's community development function is such an important part of the Federal Reserve System. Getting monetary policy decisions right requires a deep understanding of the conditions of local economies across the nation. This need is one of the reasons that the Fed was designed as an institution with a presence in every region of the country, ensuring that the experiences and perspectives of people from everywhere are considered in the decisions we make. It is why the Federal Reserve is actively seeking input from the public in formulating our long-term goals and strategy for monetary policy, with listening sessions around the country, including one right here at the Cleveland Fed. We want to hear from as many communities as we can, and an important way to do that is through our long-standing connections to organizations that are supporting strong and sustainable communities. In addition to the work you do, we value your perspectives, especially on how low- and moderate-income communities are faring in the economy. Federal Reserve policymakers depend on a lot of data, such as the unemployment rate, in making our decisions, but numbers can only go so far, and we also rely on actual experiences, on the ground, of people like you and those you serve.\nBeyond providing insights on economic conditions, the Fed's community development function supports the economy by promoting access to credit and other financial services among small businesses and low- and moderate-income households and communities. This access is a cornerstone of economic opportunity and resiliency. By analyzing and disseminating information on local financial needs and highlighting successful approaches for attracting and deploying capital, the Fed's community development work advances economic vitality in communities across America.\nThe Fed staff who work on community development also work closely with the supervisors overseeing bank compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. By ensuring that these two functions are working together, we can support financial institutions' awareness of promising opportunities to meet their obligations under the CRA. Beyond supporting these statutory obligations, the insights gathered by the Fed's CD function serve as an early warning system of risks in the financial system. CD programs help spot emerging trends that may, for example, reveal patterns of unfair treatment of borrowers or signal risks to the safety and soundness of lending practices in particular communities.\nWhat Makes Community Development Work\nI've outlined the important role that support for community development plays at the Federal Reserve. Now I'd like to offer a few words on effective community development\u00e2\u0080\u0094what works, and some ideas for how it might work even better. While we have learned a great deal over the years about promoting healthy and vibrant people and places, there are substantial opportunities to expand and adapt successful approaches to new areas. As an institution committed to conducting and disseminating high-quality, independent, and actionable research, the Federal Reserve will continue to conduct and support research on community development, and policymakers, including me, will highlight that research and engage with the public on new ideas for creating economic opportunity, particularly in low- and moderate-income communities.\nThis includes conducting original quantitative research to shed new light on evolving challenges, such as the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' recent research looking into the incidence of youth disconnection from the labor force and education, and how that differs across communities. As far as collecting data, I would also point to our Community Perspectives Survey and the Small Business Credit Survey, which the Cleveland Fed has conducted since 2020.\n2\nBeyond collecting and analyzing data, the Federal Reserve's CD function also conducts qualitative research to understand the \"why\" behind the data. For example, the Philadelphia Fed recently published insights from their conversations with employers in the manufacturing as well as the leisure and hospitality sectors in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware on how they are addressing staffing challenges.\n3\nAnother way that the Fed helps advance knowledge is through convenings like the one we're a part of today. For example, the San Francisco Fed recently hosted the California Rural Success Summit, which aimed to connect rural stakeholders across the state and to showcase innovative efforts to enhance access to jobs and credit across rural California.\n4\nThese convenings can also take the form of virtual events, such as the New York Fed's recent webinar exploring local approaches to developing and rehabbing affordable apartments.\n5\nThese are a few of the ways that the Fed's community development work helps expand knowledge across the field. Communities also need to know how to apply that knowledge and have access to the partners and resources needed to do so. The Federal Reserve's CD function convenes local stakeholders who have a common interest in looking for ways to create opportunities and partnerships to better serve community development needs.\nFor example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has been supporting community leaders for more than a decade through its Working Places Initiative, which helps local leaders work together to build strong, healthy economies and communities.\n6\nSimilarly, through the Advance Together initiative, the Dallas Fed supports local communities across the 11th District that are addressing education and employment challenges to connect more Texans with quality jobs.\n7\nThe Atlanta Fed helped to establish and continues to actively participate in the Metro Atlanta eXchange for Workforce Solutions, a connector for workforce developers in the area. MAX, as it is known, helps bring together employers with those involved in training, apprenticeships, and certification programs to fill specific demands.\n8\nAnd, lastly, I would include the Occupational Mobility Explorer, an interactive tool developed by the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and Philadelphia that allows workers to explore career paths and visualize how job skills can transfer to higher-paying occupations.\n9\nFed CD staff also help investors and community development organizations connect with each other to explore mutually beneficial opportunities to work together. Through initiatives like the Kansas City Fed's Investment Connection and the Richmond Fed's Rural Investment Collaborative, the Federal Reserve helps communities identify potential financing partners who can move their ideas to action.\n10\nThese are just some of the ways the Federal Reserve supports the work of community development practitioners, who, as I have described, in turn support the Federal Reserve's work of promoting a healthy economy and a safe and stable financial system. Thank you for the work you do and for sharing some time with me today as we work together now and into the future to achieve our community development goals.\n1.

Barr\nAt a Fed Listens event hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Omaha, Nebraska\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, President Schmid, and thank you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for hosting this event.\n1\nThe Federal Reserve, with its system of 12 distinct regional Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., was designed to ensure that monetary policy was a national decision with input from all parts of the country. The work of the District Reserve Banks, and events like this one, make sure that a wide range of views can inform President Schmid, me, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and all of our colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) as we come together in Washington to set monetary policy.\nLet me spend just a moment on the economy and the outlook. The economy is currently on a sound footing, with low and steady unemployment, and disinflation having continued at a gradual, albeit uneven, pace toward our 2 percent target. Looking forward, however, I expect inflation to rise due to tariffs. Higher short-term inflation expectations, supply chain adjustments, and second-round effects may cause some inflation persistence. At the same time, tariffs may cause the economy to slow and unemployment to rise. There is still considerable uncertainty about tariff policies and their effects. Monetary policy is well positioned to allow us to wait and see how economic conditions unfold.\nThe broad objectives of monetary policy are clear and have been mandated by Congress\u00e2\u0080\u0094maximum employment and stable prices. Our strategy for getting there is laid out in the Fed's policy framework, which we plan to update later this year. And setting that strategy to reach our goals is informed by outreach like the session today.\nMonetary policy decisions affect everyone. Stable prices are important for families and businesses to be able to plan for the future, and for sustainable and healthy labor markets. When we get it right, we can help foster broad and inclusive employment gains that benefit the American people. Our decisions play a role, for example, in the prices for agricultural commodities that are particularly important for businesses and consumers in this region. These decisions affect the labor market, including the challenges that businesses can face in finding qualified workers, which I know is a bigger issue in Nebraska, with lower unemployment than in some other places. But the Federal Reserve's role is a limited one\u00e2\u0080\u0094most of what affects the economy are the individual decisions of households and businesses.\nThe primary tool for monetary policy is short-term interest rates, which in turn can affect longer-term rates that you, your customers, and people in your communities pay to finance land and equipment and other inputs. Credit has always played a particularly important role in agriculture, so I know that interest rates matter a lot in this part of America. Let me emphasize that real-world rates are significantly affected by other forces in the economy, but Fed policy does play a role.\nMonetary policy sometimes requires tradeoffs\u00e2\u0080\u0094a stance of policy that is necessary to lower inflation, for example, may also lower aggregate demand and slow the economy. Crucial in balancing our economic goals is determining how policy decisions affect households and businesses, which is why we are here to listen to you.\nBusinesses also have to balance their goals. Producers need to judge the strength of demand for their products and services, the trend in costs for their inputs, and the expected future costs for credit. These and other factors affect how businesses see tradeoffs as they make decisions about expanding operations and hiring. Workers need to balance their prospects for their wages keeping up with inflation or whether it's worth moving to find a better job. Your experience, and the experiences of your customers and the other people you serve, is an important input into the strategy the Fed will decide on for our long-term monetary policy framework.\nWe are going to consider everything we've learned in the past five eventful years since we last updated our framework, and we have learned a lot. But we can't do it without you, because you are who we serve. And so, since listening requires that one stop talking, I am going to wrap up by thanking everyone from the Omaha area and across the 10th District for agreeing to be part of today's gathering. I look forward to hearing what you have to say.\n1.

Kugler\nAt a Fed Listens event hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Schenectady, New York\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, President Williams. And thank you to everyone who took the time to join us here today to offer your feedback.\n1\nIt is my pleasure to be here in Albany, a region of the country that has been so critical to the growth of our nation's economy. One of the aspects I enjoy most about my job is having the opportunity to visit every region of the country and see how the economy is unfolding on the ground. I am happy to be able to do that again today.\nThe purpose of this\nFed Listens\nevent, specifically, is to receive your input as part of the public review of our long-run goals and strategy for monetary policy. We call this document our framework.\n2\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last reviewed this important document in 2019\u00e2\u0080\u00932020. At that time Committee members decided it was appropriate to complete a similar review every five years. The 2025 review consists of three elements: a research conference, discussions and deliberations at our policy meetings, and, very importantly,\nFed Listens\nevents such as this. As Chair Powell said last month, in this review we are reconsidering aspects of our strategic framework in light of the experience of the last five years. I anticipate that consideration of changes to the framework, based on the information and perspectives gathered during this review, will be complete in coming months. As part of this process, I am paying particular attention to what we have learned about the economy in the past five years, and the way changes made in the last framework review were interpreted by the public. The Committee will also consider possible enhancements to the FOMC's policy communication tools.\nBut, of course, I enjoy hearing from the public on a regular basis, not just as part of our framework review. Obtaining that on-the-ground insight is an essential ingredient to my approach in making policy. As a Fed policymaker, who is also an academic economist, I am always analyzing data to better understand how the economy is developing. However, I feel strongly that it is best to add to that technical training by hearing from people across the country, people like you. I am proud to say that I have visited nearly every Fed District during my relatively short time on the Board, and I have plans to see the remaining Districts in the near future. It is important to hear from Americans for whom we make policy. I want to listen to the perspective of families considering significant purchases and employment decisions. I want to hear from business owners about investment and hiring plans. I want local leaders to tell me about how their communities are faring. This information matters greatly to me as a policymaker. I thank you for taking the time to share your stories.\nNow the primary purpose of this event is for me and President Williams to listen to you, so I will stop here, and look forward to hearing from all of you. Thank you again.\n1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\nReturn to text\n2.

Bowman\nAt \u00e2\u0080\u009cAssessing the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a research conference sponsored by the International Journal of Central Banking and the Czech National Bank, Prague, Czech Republic\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for the invitation to join you today.\n1\nAs the Federal Reserve's Vice Chair for Supervision, I am responsible for, among other things, leading the Board's Division of Supervision and Regulation in its work to promote the safe and sound operation of the U.S. banking system. While this includes the specific activities of bank supervision and regulation, the financial system reaches far beyond the banking system. Regulators must also monitor the effects of activities that extend outside this perimeter, for example activities that have migrated from banks to non-banks, or when there are broader market implications of regulatory actions and their potential effects on financial stability. Regulations should not be created in a static world of \"set it and forget it.\"\nToday, my remarks will focus specifically on how the passage of time\u00e2\u0080\u0094with underlying changes in the composition of the economy and the financial system, interest rate shifts, and patterns and preferences of banking and financial activity\u00e2\u0080\u0094can lead to unintended policy application and unexpected consequences. Regulators should consider these broader evolving dynamics as they craft regulations to endure beyond today's circumstances.\nTypically, these effects are not contemplated in the scope of the usual cost-benefit analysis, as shifts occur over time after a new rule or regulation is implemented or enacted. But shifts can, in effect, become new policy choices with consequences that can pose significant issues.\nOne shift in particular is that of the supplementary leverage ratio increasingly becoming the binding capital constraint for the largest banks in the United States. The U.S. banking system includes two basic types of capital requirements: risk-based requirements that impose a capital \"charge\" based on the underlying risk of a particular activity, and leverage-based requirements that do not differentiate based on the risk characteristics of underlying assets. And while leverage-based capital requirements are generally intended to operate as a backstop to risk-based requirements, changes in the financial system and the broader economy can alter this relationship between capital requirements. This shift in the nature of leverage-based capital requirements, from backstop to binding constraint, was not driven by a deliberate policymaking process, but rather by the maintenance of a high level of reserves in the banking system, as well as the introduction of liquidity requirements that compelled banks to replace loans with high-quality liquid assets.\n2\nMonetary Policy and Economic Outlook\nBefore turning to the main theme of my remarks, I would like to give a brief update on my outlook for the economy and monetary policy.\nAt the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting last week, the Committee voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4\u00e2\u0080\u00911/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. I supported this decision because the data shows a solid labor market and I would like to see further confirmation that inflation is close to our 2 percent target on a sustained basis.\nIf inflation remains near its current level or continues to move closer to our target, or if the data show signs of weakening in labor market conditions, it would be appropriate to consider lowering the policy rate, moving it closer to a neutral setting.\nAt this point, we have not seen significant economic impacts from trade developments or other factors, and the U.S. economy has continued to be resilient despite some slowing in economic growth. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP) growth slowed to a moderate pace in the first quarter, even as activity was partly boosted by a pull-forward of spending on motor vehicles and high-tech equipment ahead of the implementation of tariffs. Although the pull-forward of spending appears to be unwinding, retail and motor vehicle sales through May provide further evidence that PDFP has softened so far this year.\nThe labor market appears to remain solid, with payroll employment rising about 140,000 per month, on average, in April and May, only slightly below the average monthly gains over the past two quarters. This pace of job gains appears consistent with the unemployment rate remaining at a low 4.2 percent through May, which is roughly unchanged since the middle of last year.\nThe labor market appears to be stable near estimates of full employment, with layoffs remaining low. The number of job openings relative to job seekers has moved roughly sideways since the middle of last year at, or a touch below, the pre-pandemic level. And the labor market no longer appears to be especially tight or a significant source of inflation pressures, as most wage growth measures have slowed closer to a pace consistent with 2 percent inflation.\nTurning to inflation, we have seen a welcome return to further moderation of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation over the past three months. The May consumer and producer price reports suggest that 12-month core PCE inflation stood at 2.6 percent in May, down meaningfully from its elevated reading of 2.9 percent at the end of last year. Similar to the past two years, elevated monthly inflation readings in January and February have been followed by low readings as we move into the spring.\nOn a 12-month basis, core PCE goods inflation has picked up somewhat since last December, but this has been more than offset by a considerable slowing in core PCE services inflation. It appears that any upward pressure from higher tariffs on goods prices is being offset by other factors and that the underlying trend in core PCE inflation is moving much closer to our 2 percent target than is currently apparent in the data. With housing services inflation on a sustained downward trajectory, and other core services inflation already consistent with 2 percent inflation, only core goods inflation remains somewhat elevated likely reflecting limited passthrough from tariffs.\nWith economic growth slowing, it is possible that recent softness in aggregate demand could be starting to translate into weaker labor market conditions. While still strong, the labor market appears to be less dynamic, with modest hiring rates, layoffs edging up from low levels, and job gains concentrated in just a few industries. With inflation on a sustained trajectory toward 2 percent, softness in aggregate demand, and signs of fragility in the labor market, I think that we should put more weight on downside risks to our employment mandate going forward.\nDespite progress on lowering inflation, there are potential upside risks if negotiations result in higher tariffs or if firms raise goods prices independent of any tariff pass-through. Although we have not seen evidence of disruptive impacts on supply chains, changes in global trade patterns could lead to an increase in prices for goods and services. The current conflict in the Middle East or other geopolitical tensions could also lead to higher commodity prices.\nI am certainly attentive to these inflation risks, but I am not yet seeing a major concern, as some retailers seem unwilling to raise prices for essentials due to high price sensitivity among low-income consumers and as supply chains appear to be largely unaffected so far.\nMeasures of policy and economic uncertainty have receded from recent highs, and measures of consumer and business sentiment have also improved in recent weeks after having dropped considerably. These developments reinforce my view that concerns will subside as more clarity emerges on trade policy. Businesses appear to be resuming investment and hiring decisions, as they feel increasingly confident that less favorable trade outcomes are unlikely to occur.\nI remain focused on how new policies evolve and whether future data releases will provide perspective about their economic impacts. On trade policy, I expect that negotiations will ultimately result in lower tariff rates than are currently in place, consistent with the resumption of financial market optimism. Further, should we see effects on inflation this year, I expect that increased slack in the economy will limit this to a small, one-off impact.\nSmall and one-off price increases this year should translate only into a small drag on real activity. I also expect that less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more friendly business environment will likely boost supply and largely offset any negative effects on economic activity and prices.\nIn considering the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I fully supported the revised characterization of uncertainty and the balance of risks in our most recent monetary policy statement, pointing to the diminished uncertainty and removing the emphasis on risks to both sides of our mandate. In my view, it was appropriate to recognize that the balance of risks has shifted. In fact, the data have not shown clear signs of material impacts from tariffs and other policies. I think it is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed, and have a smaller effect than initially expected, especially because many firms front-loaded their stocks of inventories. And, all considered, ongoing progress on trade and tariff negotiations has led to an economic environment that is now demonstrably less risky. The change in our monetary policy statement appropriately incorporates this shift in the balance of risks as well as the rapid improvement in many measures of uncertainty.\nAs we think about the path forward, it is time to consider adjusting the policy rate. As inflation has declined or come in below expectations over the past few months, we should recognize that inflation appears to be on a sustained path toward 2 percent and that there will likely be only minimal impacts on overall core PCE inflation from changes to trade policy. We should also recognize that downside risks to our employment mandate could soon become more salient, given recent softness in spending and signs of fragility in the labor market.\nBefore our next meeting in July, we will have received one additional month of employment and inflation data. If upcoming data show inflation continuing to evolve favorably, with upward pressures remaining limited to goods prices, or if we see signs that softer spending is spilling over into weaker labor market conditions, such developments should be addressed in our policy discussions and reflected in our deliberations. Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting in order to bring it closer to its neutral setting and to sustain a healthy labor market. In the meantime, I will continue to carefully monitor economic conditions as the Administration's policies, the economy, and financial markets continue to evolve.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook, guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance.\nBringing inflation in line with our price-stability goal is essential for sustaining a healthy labor market and fostering an economy that works for everyone in the longer run.\nPolicy Shifts and Unintended Consequences\nIn my responsibilities over bank regulation and supervision at the Federal Reserve, I intend to apply a pragmatic approach. We will review data and evidence, identify problems that need to be resolved, and develop efficient solutions to address those identified issues.\n3\nWhile the regulatory authority of the Federal Reserve is primarily related to the banking system, the\nconsequences\nof banking regulation and supervisory efforts are not limited to the banking system. Bank regulation and supervision affect how financial activities are conducted, the cost and availability of credit and financial services, and even what types of entities provide those services. While it is important to consider the consequences of regulatory actions as they evolve over time, in cases where regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we must examine whether those risks are justified by the safety and soundness benefits of the regulation.\nBank-affiliated broker-dealers play a critical role in U.S. capital markets, including in Treasury market intermediation activities. Today I will discuss the lessons we have learned about how bank regulatory requirements, specifically leverage ratios in the United States, can have unintended consequences. Leverage ratio impacts on bank-affiliated broker-dealers can have broader impacts, including market impacts like those observed in Treasury market intermediation activities. Once we've identified \"emerging\" unintended consequences\u00e2\u0080\u0094issues that were not contemplated during the development of a regulatory approach\u00e2\u0080\u0094we must consider how to revisit earlier regulatory and policy decisions.\nAs I will discuss in greater detail shortly, regulators must act quickly to address the growing problems with increasingly binding leverage ratios. In 2021, in connection with the expiration of temporary, emergency changes to the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), the Federal Reserve committed to \"soon\" inviting public comment on potential modifications.\n4\nOver four years later, a proposal has not been issued, and problems with Treasury market intermediation continue to emerge. The time has come for the federal banking agencies to revisit leverage ratios and their impacts on the Treasury markets.\nLooking at the Data: Treasury Market Functioning\nAs a first step in this pragmatic approach, it is important to look at what the data says about Treasury market functioning. This is a necessary first step before we determine whether there are issues or problems that can be addressed through adjustments to bank regulatory requirements.\nA review of Treasury market data provides a history of growing issues with Treasury market functioning. In recent years, U.S. policy debates have highlighted the need to take preventative measures to ensure smooth market functioning. One issue that continues to persist is low levels of Treasury market liquidity as the Board's semiannual\nFi",

Waller\nAt \u00e2\u0080\u009cAssessing the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u009d 2025 IJCB Research Conference, hosted by the Czech National Bank and the International Journal of Central Banking, Prague, Czech Republic\nShare\nThank you, Ale\u00c5\u00a1, and thank you to the Czech National Bank (CNB) for hosting this year's conference. The CNB also supported this conference in 2017. It is wonderful to have such a great relationship between the\nInternational Journal of Central Banking\n(IJCB) and one of our sponsoring institutions.\nI would like to take a few minutes as the outgoing managing editor of the IJCB to emphasize the importance of this journal and the research it supports.\n1\nCentral banks play an important role promoting the growth and effective functioning of their economies, and many of the decisions they make are influenced by careful and cutting-edge research. In fact, I recently gave a speech that discussed the importance of economic research in monetary policy decisions.\n2\nThe IJCB, through this conference and its volumes, provides an outlet to share and disseminate research that adds to public knowledge and understanding and informs the operational and policy decisions of central bankers.\nThe value of central bank\u00e2\u0080\u0093focused research has long been known. In the summer of 2004, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the European Central Bank, and the Group of Ten central banks agreed to support the development of the IJCB to focus on the theory and practice of central banking. The journal has attracted distinguished managing editors, including my colleagues from the Federal Reserve; my immediate predecessor, Luc Laeven, from the European Central Bank; and the current managing editor, Antoine Martin, from the Swiss National Bank, who, unfortunately, could not be here today. We have the strong support now of nearly 55 sponsoring institutions, including the Czech National Bank and also the host of last year's conference, the Central Bank of Italy. Among the ways that central banks serve the public interest is as an ongoing source of economic research, and the strong commitment to the IJCB here in Prague and other capitals advances our collective interest in strong economies and financial stability.\nTurning to this year's conference, we chose the theme based on events that have been very much on the minds of central bankers: \"Assessing the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic.\" The past several years have seen significant monetary policy actions across the globe in response to COVID\u00e2\u0080\u009019\u00e2\u0080\u0093induced recessions, inflation higher than in several decades, unprecedented supply chain disruptions, and, in some countries, very tight labor markets. Early on, policymakers' responses appeared quite in sync, but with differing speeds of recovery and varying challenges faced by different types of economies, that changed over time. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and energy price shocks have introduced new complexities. So we thought this conference could be a good place to come together and hear about the lessons we have learned from these common and different experiences.\nToday and tomorrow we will be discussing the yield curve, policy rules, and monetary policy transmission. We also will look into banking issues such as loan issuance and financial stability. And we are lucky to have the Fed's Vice Chair for Supervision Miki Bowman here to give a keynote speech. As we go through these sessions, I hope we will all ask ourselves how this work can help policymakers do their jobs better. Through our conversation, I would ask you to share knowledge about each of these topics as they are pertinent around the world.\nBut before we get to those presentations, and what I hope will be vigorous discussion, let me recognize several people who made this event possible. Here at the CNB, Simona Malovan\u00e1 and Martin Hodula helped organize this conference. Year round, the IJCB co-editors devote many hours of their time to review papers to keep the journal at its high-quality and high-impact status. These individuals are Ana Babus, Diana Bonfim, Huberto Ennis, Carlos Garriga (who is here with us today), Refet G\u00fcrkaynak, \u00d2scar Jord\u00e0, Robin Lumsdaine, Fernanda Nechio, Steven Ongena, and Enrico Sete. Finally, for the past three years, the day-to-day smooth running of the journal couldn't have been accomplished without the editorial team at the BIS and the Board of Governors. A special thank you goes to my team: Kommaly Dias, Jane Ihrig, and Elie Singer, who worked to oversee the process.\nAnd with that, I will step away from the microphone and put the spotlight where it should be, on the scholars presenting their work today. Thank you, and I believe Martin has a few words to get us started.\n1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\nReturn to text\n2. See Christopher J.

Bowman\nAt the Georgetown University McDonough School of Business Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nIt is a pleasure to join you today for my first public remarks as the Federal Reserve Board's Vice Chair for Supervision.\n1\nToday, I will describe my approach to leading the Fed's Division of Supervision and Regulation in its vital work to promote the safe and sound operation of the U.S. banking system. I have spoken extensively in the past about my principles for supervision and regulation, which will continue to guide my approach to supervision and the bank regulatory framework.\n2\nAt the core of these principles is pragmatism, which focuses on first identifying the problem to be solved and then developing efficient solutions.\n3\nOnce we have identified a need for reform, or a problem to be solved, our next task is to conduct a careful analysis of the intended and unintended consequences of any proposed policy solution, and to consider alternative approaches that lead to lower cost or better outcomes.\nThe views I share with you today reflect my initial thoughts about how these principles should be incorporated into the important work that will be required to improve supervision and regulation in the future, addressing: (i) enhancing supervision to more effectively and efficiently meet the Fed's safety and soundness goals; (ii) reviewing and reforming the capital framework to ensure that it is appropriately designed and calibrated; (iii) reviewing regulations and information collections to ensure that this framework remains viable; and (iv) considering approaches to ensure the applications process is transparent, predictable, and fair.\nEnhancing Supervision\nSupervision focused on material financial risks that threaten a bank's safety and soundness is inherently more effective and efficient. We should be cautious about the temptation to overemphasize or become distracted by relatively less important procedural and documentation shortcomings. Fundamentally, as I've noted in the past, our goal should be to prioritize the identification of material financial risks and encourage prompt action to mitigate risks that threaten safety and soundness. There are a number of changes we can adopt in the near term to better enable us to accomplish this goal:\nTailoring\n.\nRisks are not uniform, and each bank is unique based on its business model, complexity, and business profile. I am a long-time proponent of tailoring banking regulations. Going forward we will extend the application of tailoring to our supervisory approach to financial institutions, not only among bank categories, but also within a particular category.\nIn the past, the Board has \"pushed down\" requirements developed for the largest firms to smaller banks, often including regional and community banks. One approach that would preserve tailoring is to create an independent community bank supervisory and regulatory framework to clearly separate these banks from larger bank supervision and regulation. This would serve to insulate these smaller banks from standards designed for larger and more complex firms. While I have no objection to a deliberate, intentional policy to apply similar standards to firms with similar characteristics as conditions warrant, the gradual erosion of distinct regulatory and supervisory standards among firms with very different characteristics\u00e2\u0080\u0094essentially the subtle reversal of tailoring over time\u00e2\u0080\u0094is not a reasonable approach for implementing supervision and regulation.\nBoth regulators and legislators should consider whether the bank regulatory framework includes appropriate thresholds for defining distinct categories of institutions, and whether simple fixes\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example the indexing of thresholds to inflation or growth\u00e2\u0080\u0094could better ensure a sound, tailored approach that remains durable over time. It is clear that the current $10 billion threshold defining the upper bounds of a \"community bank\" leaves many institutions that pursue this business model\u00e2\u0080\u0094of community and relationship-based banking\u00e2\u0080\u0094subject to heightened requirements more suitable for larger and more complex firms.\nTo further these objectives, later this year I will host a conference on small and community bank issues, to discuss improving the bank regulatory framework to adopt a more efficient, tailored approach for these firms. We must demonstrate wisdom and courage by carefully listening to those who are subject to regulatory oversight and considering ways to enhance our approaches to both supervision and regulation.\nOne issue that continues to present challenges to smaller banks is check fraud. The ongoing increase in bank losses to this type of fraud can negatively impact the perceived safety of the banking system and result in significant consumer harm. Past efforts by regulators have been frustratingly slow to advance and seem to have done little to address the underlying root causes of this increase in fraud. I will continue to work to identify specific actions that can be taken to reduce the incidence of fraud, including through expediting the remediation process from check fraud after it occurs. I expect that the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the OCC and FDIC, will soon take action on this front.\nRatings\n. Ratings must reflect risk, and yet we have seen gradual changes in supervisory approaches that have eroded the link between ratings and financial condition.\n4\nFederal Reserve supervisory statistics show that that two-thirds of the largest financial institutions in the U.S. were rated unsatisfactory in the first half of 2024.\n5\nAt the same time, the majority of these same institutions met all supervisory expectations for capital and liquidity.\nThis odd mismatch between financial condition and supervisory ratings requires careful review and appropriate revisions to our current approach. Under the current large bank ratings framework, a single component rating can result in a firm being considered not \"well-managed,\" which has driven the disparity between well-managed status and financial condition.\nThe Federal Reserve will soon begin to address this mismatch, by proposing changes to the Large Financial Institution ratings framework. The proposed changes will be designed to result in a more sensible approach to determining whether a firm is well-managed, no longer disproportionately weighting a single framework component for a firm that has demonstrated resilience under a range of conditions and stresses.\nThis initial change should help address the gap between assessed ratings and material financial risk for those firms subject to this framework. We have an obligation to ensure that our supervisory ratings are current, credible, and reflect material financial risk. This promotes effective supervision and ensures that firms are accurately rated based on their underlying financial strength, which should increase the public's confidence in our assessment of the banking system.\nWe must also consider the appropriateness of the broader ratings framework which applies to smaller institutions, including the CAMELS framework. Are these frameworks appropriately tailored to capture material financial risks, particularly for elements that rely on subjective examiner judgment? While judgment is a legitimate and necessary tool in supervision, it must always be grounded in the materiality of the identified issues as they relate to the financial health of each institution and the banking system as a whole. This has been a notable shift in supervision not only for large banks, but also for regional and community banks.\nImproving prioritization.\nExaminers review a broad range of activities in the supervisory process. A random sample of examination reports demonstrates that supervisory focus has shifted away from core financial risks (credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk, for example), to process-related concerns. While process is important for effective management, there is a risk that overemphasis on process and supervisory box-checking can be a distraction from the core purpose of supervision, which is to probe financial condition and financial risk. Checklists should not distract examiners from the central purpose of examinations.\nAnother tool that we will be reviewing with a critical lens is the use of horizontal reviews. In theory, horizontal reviews\u00e2\u0080\u0094where examiners conduct a narrow but deep review on a particular topic across multiple banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094can help improve an examiner's perspective. Horizontal reviews, when used effectively, can help supervisors better understand the range of industry practices.\nBut these reviews have quickly evolved into oversimplification of complex issues and often include \"grading on a curve,\" where firms are rank-ordered, with an expectation that implementing a simpler approach fails to meet expectations, under the assumption that the more complex approach is appropriate for all firms. However, this side-by-side comparison fails to address the only question that matters: whether a firm's approach meets appropriate legal and supervisory standards for the individual firm's characteristics. Differences in approaches are not indicative of shortcomings, particularly since these can often be explained by distinguishing the underlying activities, scope and scale of operations, and risk tolerance of the firm's board and management.\nThere is also a lack of transparency in the results of these exams, and a risk that horizontal reviews will create generally applicable rules without complying with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). I will be looking closely at whether the continued use of horizontal exams going forward is appropriate, and if so, to ensure that these exams are sufficiently transparent, they reflect proper respect for the APA, and do not circumvent our responsibility to provide each regulated institution with a fair, firm-specific evaluation.\nThe role of guidance in supervision.\nFinally, I will discuss the important role of guidance in the supervisory process. Guidance can be an effective tool to promote transparency in supervisory expectations, to provide clarity to regulated institutions on the permissibility of new activities and their associated risks, and to provide firms some perspective on how they may comply with statutory and regulatory requirements. Structured with these goals in mind, guidance can further the objective of supervisory prioritization.\nWhere guidance does not further these objectives, it is worth revisiting. I think it is important that we review a wide range of existing guidance, including outstanding Supervision and Regulation Letters (SR Letters), topical guidance that addresses issues that may adversely affect innovation (like the extensive guidance that has some bearing on third-party risk management), and the many other guidance documents that have been issued in recent years.\nFundamentally, guidance should clarify expectations, and provide answers to industry questions, such as our earlier \"office hours\" guidance that provided a venue for banks and innovators to share information on new products and services like digital asset activities and artificial intelligence.\nChanging expectations around the use of guidance, as a tool to promote clarity in supervisory expectations, can encourage innovation in the banking system. Uncertainty in supervisory expectations has long been an obstacle to banks seeking to innovate, including banks engaging in digital asset activities or incorporating new technologies like artificial intelligence to improve efficiency and delivery of products and services. Just as it is imperative that banks innovate to remain competitive in the future, it is critical that bank supervisors enable the adoption of new technologies in a manner consistent with safety and soundness.\nExaminer training and workforce development\n.\nExaminers must engage in a challenging course of study and pass rigorous tests before qualifying to become a commissioned bank examiner. Those who have obtained this license have a strong foundation that they can rely on to conduct appropriate examinations. The commission demonstrates an elevated level of expertise, judgment, and fairness that these examiners bring to their work. As such, they should not shy away from transparency or public accountability.\nCurrently, the Federal Reserve does not require all staff involved in supervision and bank examination to have met or to be on a path to meet this credential. Regulated entities should be able to expect that all of our examination and supervisory teams have achieved or are working to achieve this level of professional expertise. Going forward, the Fed will prioritize this training, particularly as we face an aging workforce across the Federal banking agencies that will require our new examination staff to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system into the future. Failure to invest in and plan for examiner training today will result in much less effective supervision in years to come.\nCapital\nCapital requirements are an important component of the prudential regulatory framework and are essential for the stability of interconnected banking and financial systems around the world. Yet too often, our efforts to address capital reform take a piecemeal approach to capital requirements. We tend to review individual elements of the capital framework in isolation, without considering whether proposed changes are sensible in the aggregate and contribute to a capital framework in which all components work together effectively.\nWhile each component is important, the aggregate calibration of requirements is ultimately the most meaningful, and we must examine whether this approach in totality appropriately captures risk. Over-calibrated capital requirements effectively create market distortions, disfavoring some activities over others in a way that is divorced from prudential safety and soundness goals and economic conditions.\nLeverage ratios are one example that illustrates this concern. The Federal Reserve has long acknowledged that leverage ratios are intended to act as a \"backstop\" to risk-based capital requirements. When leverage ratios become the binding capital constraint at an excessive level, they can create market distortions. This is especially true in the case of the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR) which is applicable to the largest banks.\nAs a result of this leverage requirement, banks are less inclined to engage in low-risk activities like Treasury market intermediation and revise their business activities in a way that is neither justified nor responsive to their customer ne",

Kugler\nAt the Economic Club of New York, New York, New York\nShare\nThank you, Barbara, and thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. It is an honor to join other members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) who have addressed the Economic Club of New York over the years.\n1\nMy subject is the current state of the U.S. economy, the economic outlook, and the implications for monetary policy. The short version is that the labor market appears resilient and stable and economic activity is continuing to grow, although at a more moderate pace than in the second half of last year.\nWhile the labor market is currently at or near the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, there is the prospect that trade and other policy changes could raise the unemployment rate and push employment away from our objective. These policies, especially higher import tariffs, could also raise inflation over the rest of this year. In fact, while progress toward the FOMC's goal of 2 percent inflation has continued, we have seen an escalation in goods inflation and data from surveys, and non-traditional sources point to some inflationary pressures as well.\nIn addition to increases in U.S. import tariffs and retaliatory increases in the tariffs foreign countries apply to U.S. exports, other policy changes, either proposed or already underway relate to immigration, fiscal policy and regulation. Those policies could affect economic conditions, and since it is the FOMC's job to set monetary policy that is best able to achieve our mandated goals of maximum employment and stable prices, we must consider the effects of these policies. So far, we are beginning to see the impact only of higher tariffs on inflation. Still, thinking about the outlook requires consideration of how the economy could be affected by all these policy changes moving forward.\nIt remains difficult to judge the current strength of economic activity, based on data through the first four months of 2025, primarily because of the front-loading of imports ahead of the implementation of tariffs. While real gross domestic product (GDP) declined slightly in the first quarter, that was largely because of a surge in imports ahead of anticipated tariff increases, a surge that will likely reverse. Putting aside fluctuations in trade and in inventories and focusing on the April data, personal income and consumption point to a slight moderation in economic activity. While personal disposable income increased at a healthy pace so far this year, consumption grew more slowly in April, which may indicate consumers are becoming more cautious. That said, there is considerable uncertainty about imports in the second quarter and uncertainty about the impact that higher prices will have on spending, so I will be looking for more evidence about economic activity in May ahead of the FOMC's next meeting, June 17 and 18.\nOne encouraging sign about economic activity is the resilience of the labor market. We will get the May employment report tomorrow, but the data in hand indicate that employment has continued to grow and that labor supply and demand remain in relative balance. In April, employers added 177,000 jobs, slightly higher than the average for the previous six months. The unemployment rate was steady in April at 4.2 percent, in the historically low range of 4 percent to 4.2 percent that it has remained in since May 2024. Data on job openings and quits for April likewise point to a resilient but somewhat looser labor market with a balance of supply and demand. The vacancy rate, a measure of demand for workers, was 4.4 percent, down from a peak of 7.4 percent three years ago and roughly the same level as just before the pandemic.\n2\nThe quits rate, an indicator of the confidence workers feel in finding a job, has been in the narrow range of 1.9 to 2.2 percent since December 2023, and just a bit below the average level in 2019.\n3\nAhead of tomorrow's employment report, other data that we have for May are generally consistent with this picture of the labor market but may suggest some cooling. The average of private-sector forecasters' predictions for total job creation is 130,000.\n4\nAlso, while the pace of job layoffs remained at historically low levels through the final week of May, based on the number of new claims for unemployment benefits, other measures suggest modest increases in layoffs. For instance, Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notifications (WARN notices) of layoffs have ticked up since the beginning of the year, as have the mentions of layoffs in the Fed's Beige Book survey and job cuts data reported by Challenger, Gray and Christmas.\nThe other side of the FOMC's dual mandate is price stability. Progress in lowering inflation toward the Committee's 2 percent target has slowed some since last summer, even if headline and core inflation have continued to decline. The FOMC's preferred inflation gauge, based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE), grew at a 2.1 percent annual rate in April. While that is quite close to the FOMC's target, it was dragged down by a decline in energy prices. Core inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094which excludes volatile prices for food and energy and is a good guide to future inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094came in at 2.5 percent, so I do believe that our monetary policy stance, which I view as modestly restrictive, is currently appropriate to achieve and sustain 2 percent inflation over the longer term.\nSticking with core inflation, to help me judge ongoing progress toward price stability, I like to look at the 12-month change in each of the three main categories of core inflation: housing services, services excluding housing, and goods. The PCE price index for housing services has declined markedly in the past year, from 5.7 percent in April 2024 to 4.2 percent in April this year, but it is still considerably above the level that persisted before the pandemic. Meanwhile, the PCE price index for core services excluding housing, which makes up more than half of core PCE inflation, has declined from 3.6 percent in April last year to 3 percent in April 2025, still somewhat above the level that prevailed before the pandemic. And the third category is core goods inflation, which rose at a 0.2 percent annual rate in the 12 months through April, compared with April 2024 when it had actually fallen 0.5 percent over the previous 12 months. In recent decades, core goods prices have typically fallen over time, helping to keep a lid on overall inflation, so this is a meaningful reversal of the disinflationary process. To sum up, while core services inflation has fallen, it is still running above the rate before the pandemic, and the progress on core goods inflation has reversed. I have been paying attention to this reversal for some time and how this could be exacerbated by the announced and implemented tariffs.\nResearch published recently by Federal Reserve Board staff calculates the pass-through of tariffs enacted before April 2 to individual product categories tracked in personal consumption expenditures.\n5\nUsing PCE data from February through April, the authors estimate that the 20 percentage point increase in tariffs on Chinese imports earlier in the year raised overall core PCE prices by two tenths of 1 percent. Since tariffs on China are currently higher than 20 percent, and tariffs have increased for other countries, these results tell me, first, that the pass-through of tariffs into prices is relatively quick, and, second, should elevated tariffs persist, even just in the short run, larger effects may be coming soon. The import surge I mentioned earlier, ahead of sharp tariff increases, has delayed the price effects associated with those tariffs, and the reversal in that surge that I expect in the next few months will likely signal larger price increases.\nAn important feature of most of the data I have mentioned so far is that it is released with significant lags. For example, the initial estimate of GDP is released about 30 days after the end of the quarter, and two later revisions mean that we may not get a clear idea of how output increased until nearly three months afterward. Monthly data on job openings are typically released with a one-month delay. The reasons for these lags are well known. For instance, statistical agencies can only survey households and businesses every so often, and it takes time to compile and publish high-quality statistics. Still, if policymakers solely rely on these traditional data to forecast what the economy will do in the future, they end up focusing on the past, which is a little like driving down the road by looking in a rearview mirror.\nAs I mentioned in my speech last year to the National Association for Business Economics, there has been an explosion of nontraditional or soft data produced by the private sector, giving us an opportunity to measure economic developments with greater timeliness (sometimes even in real time), at a higher frequency, and with more granularity.\n6\nThese data are released closer to the time of collection, such as several surveys from the Federal Reserve Banks. Given today's fast-changing and uncertain environment, soft and non-traditional data becomes all the more important.\nThat said, nontraditional data often face their own challenges, including issues with representativeness, the lack of methodological consistency, and a short time-series history. And, to be clear, while some non-traditional data are indeed \"soft data\" in that they capture sentiment or expectations, other data in this category are decidedly \"hard,\" since they are based on actual decisions and actions by businesses and households. In evaluating both traditional and nontraditional data on the economy, I face a tradeoff between timeliness and precision, but both sources are essential for me in formulating an outlook.\nSo, in the context of hard data that has lately been providing a less-than-clear view of the economy, what are the nontraditional data telling me about meeting the FOMC's two economic objectives? On the price-stability side, survey data from businesses suggest that price increases are coming. These surveys report diffusion indexes, which are calculated as the percentage of total respondents reporting increases in prices minus the percentage reporting declines. Surveys for May point to indexes for inputs and selling prices being elevated relative to the beginning of the year, probably reflecting effects from higher tariffs. Manufacturing and non-manufacturing surveys from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), as well as several surveys from the Federal Reserve Banks report increases in material prices and prices charged to customers, with many respondents volunteering that this is related to tariff increases.\nI believe expectations of future inflation are an important determinant of current inflation, and data for May continue to point to increases in measures of near-term inflation expectations. An average of private-sector economists published by the Survey of Professional Forecasters finds that expectations for core PCE inflation over the next year moved up from 2.4 percent in April to 2.9 percent in May. Among data on inflation expectations, the most dramatic increases have been seen in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. While I take seriously the concern that recent methodological changes in the survey may have made this measure less reliable, this survey is a longstanding and important barometer of consumer sentiment, and I still monitor the signals it is giving us closely. According to the Michigan survey, consumers expect inflation in the next year to average 6.6 percent and over the next 5 to 10 years to average 4.2 percent. Tariffs continued to be an important issue in the Michigan survey, with nearly three-quarters of consumers mentioning them, up from almost 60 percent in April. Firms have also raised their inflation expectations, with a survey by the Cleveland Fed reporting an increase in one-year-ahead expectations from 3.2 percent in the first quarter to 3.9 percent in the second.\nHowever, I still see stability in most measures of longer-run inflation expectations. Notably, expectations among professional forecasters for inflation 6 to 10 years ahead decreased from 2.1 percent in April to 2 percent in May. That provides me some comfort, as it points to confidence from the public in the Fed to bring inflation to our goal of 2 percent over the medium term.\nRecent developments and the data I have been monitoring have led me to consider at least three channels through which tariffs could have a persistent influence on inflation. First, as I have mentioned in some previous speeches, while it is true that short-run inflation expectations are influenced by short-term economic shocks, I value them because they often represent the horizon of decisionmaking for businesses and consumers.\n7\nThe increase in short-run inflation expectations that I previously mentioned may give businesses more leeway to raise prices, thus increasing the persistence of inflation. A second channel for tariffs influencing inflation could be opportunistic pricing by firms, if they take advantage to increase prices of items not directly affected by tariffs. This, along with tariffs on intermediate goods, could generate second-round effects on inflation. And a third channel is that lower productivity may lead to upward pressure on prices. As firms adjust to the higher input costs and lower demand, they may cut back on capital investment and shift to a less-efficient combination of inputs. While, so far, I have only seen anecdotal evidence for the opportunistic pricing among these three channels, I am closely monitoring any signs of increased persistence on inflation.\nNontraditional data indicators of real activity suggest that the economy might be starting to slow. Measures of household sentiment about economic conditions remain downbeat, such as those from the University of Michigan or the Conference Board. As for businesses, manufacturing surveys, such as the ISM, report a slowing in new orders. Additionally, the May Beige Book reports that economic activity has declined slightly relative to April. On the services side, representing the majority of businesses, the ISM PMI has trended down in the past few months and reached a level in May consistent with stagnation. Focusing on the ISM services new order component, it declined significantly in May to one of its lowest levels in recent years.\nIn summary, the nontraditional data on economic activity are consistent with my overall assessment that we might be seeing some moderation in the growth of economic activity but not yet a significant slowdown.

Cook\nAt a Fed Listens event hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, President Bostic. And thank you to all of you who came out to join the Federal Reserve today. It is so wonderful to be back in my home state of Georgia. I was born and raised 100 miles down the road in Milledgeville, I have been an Atlanta baseball fan since Hank Aaron was swatting the baseball out of Fulton County Stadium (any Atlanta fans here?), and I have spent a lot of time here in Atlanta, including when I attended Spelman and Georgia Tech.\n1\nThe Federal Reserve has been given a dual mandate of maximum employment and stables prices. The purpose of today's\nFed Listens\nevent is to hear from all of you about how the Federal Reserve's approach to monetary policy affects your families, your businesses, and your communities. I appreciate your interest in our work. Events like these provide valuable information to Fed policymakers, like President Bostic and me. The Federal Reserve System is really designed to be part of the communities we serve. The Fed has a Reserve Bank in every region of the U.S., and those Banks have Branches that carry out many important functions, including making sure the priorities and concerns on a local level are reflected in monetary policy decisions made in Washington.\nAs an economist, I am always studying incoming data and information to make the best policy decisions. Much of that comes in the form of statistics from various agencies, universities, and businesses. But another extremely valuable input comes from people, like you, who can tell us how the economy is playing out in their daily lives as they make purchases, consider investments, and think about employment choices. That is why I especially value these opportunities.\nThis\nFed Listens\nevent is specifically tied to the review of our long-run goals and strategy for monetary policy, which we call our framework.\n2\nIt was last updated five years ago. At that time, it was determined that it makes sense to regularly revisit the framework through a public review. Thank you for being part of this today. Again, the primary purpose of this event is to listen to you all, so I will stop here.\nThank you. I look forward to hearing your input.\n1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\nReturn to text\n2.

Cook\nAt the Council on Foreign Relations, New York, New York\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Michael. I am honored to be back at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n1\nI would like to congratulate you on becoming president of this august body. I have known Mike for some time. In fact, he helped me when I was a graduate student working on my dissertation on Eastern Europe at the University of California, Berkeley and visited the Treasury Department. I am grateful for your generosity during that time and over my career, Mike. I also want to thank the Council on Foreign Relations for awarding me a postdoctoral International Affairs Fellowship that allowed me to serve at the Treasury Department. This fellowship provided a transformational experience, and today, as a Federal Reserve Governor, I regularly draw on the significant lessons I learned during the 2000\u00e2\u0080\u009301 period. I am glad to see this important program still going strong.\nTo set the foundation for our discussion today, I will offer my outlook on the economy and share my views on the path of monetary policy. I will then put my thoughts in a global context by briefly examining how we can apply cross-country lessons learned during the pandemic recovery to the current period.\nEconomic Outlook\nThe U.S. economy is still on a firm footing, but uncertainty has notably increased since the beginning of the year. The latest data indicate that unemployment continues to be low, while inflation remains somewhat above the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent goal. However, there is evidence that changes to trade policy are starting to affect the economy. I do not express views on the Administration's policies. But I do study the economic implications, which appear to be increasing the likelihood of both higher inflation and labor\u00e2\u0080\u0093market cooling. In this environment, monetary policy will need to carefully balance our dual-mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment. Former Chair Ben Bernanke said that, in times of uncertainty, policymakers must consider a range of possible scenarios about the state of the economy. The resulting policy decisions, he said, \"may look quite different from those that would be optimal under certainty.\"\n2\nLet me start by looking at one part of our mandate. Inflation has declined from its pandemic highs but remains somewhat above target. The most recent data show that inflation was 2.1 percent for the 12 months ending in April and 2.5 percent when excluding food and energy costs.\n3\nPrice increases tied to changes in trade policy may make it difficult to achieve further progress in the near term. One-year inflation expectations have risen sharply this year. So far, most measures of longer-term inflation expectations have moved less significantly. I will continue to monitor these data carefully. The recent post-pandemic experience with high inflation could make firms more willing to raise prices and consumers more likely to expect high inflation to persist.\nI will now turn to the other part of our mandate. The labor market has remained resilient, at least through early spring. The unemployment rate in April held steady at 4.2 percent, a historically low level. Payroll job gains averaged nearly 150,000 per month through four months this year, a moderation from last year. Trade policy changes could alter hiring plans in the near future. Changes to global trading patterns could also have a negative effect on U.S. productivity. Though, as I noted in recent remarks, productivity gains associated with the introduction of artificial intelligence technology into the workplace could potentially, at least in part, counter that effect.\n4\nIn terms of overall economic activity, U.S. GDP moved lower in the first quarter after solid growth last year. However, private domestic final purchases, which exclude net exports, inventory investment, and government spending, grew last quarter at a rate consistent with recent readings. Looking ahead, I anticipate a slowdown in the expansion of economic activity from last year's pace. The ultimate level of tariffs remains unknown because policy changes are still developing. However, the effects are already noticeable. Manufacturing output declined in April. Orders for heavy trucks plunged. Firms reported a drop in capital expenditure plans for 2025. Measures of uncertainty have increased, on net, this year, and household and business sentiment has declined, despite some recent improvements in both.\nMonetary Policy\nWhile the economy remains solid, the economic environment could become highly challenging for monetary policymakers. At our most recent policy meeting last month, I supported the FOMC's decision to leave our policy interest rate unchanged. The current stance of monetary policy is well positioned to respond to a range of potential developments.\nTrade policy changes and the response of financial markets, firms, and consumers suggest risks to both sides of our dual mandate. As I consider the appropriate path of monetary policy, I will carefully consider how to balance our dual mandate, and I will take into account the fact that price stability is essential for achieving long periods of strong labor market conditions.\nInternational Comparison\nIn light of the fact that the current paths for the U.S. and global economy are uncertain, I think it is helpful to study a recent period when that was also the case: the pandemic downturn and the inflation that followed. To launch our discussion, I will highlight two lessons from cross-country experiences that might apply today.\nOne lesson is that the inflation environment can change abruptly, especially in a world with global shocks. The pandemic revealed how large global shocks can generate severe supply and demand imbalances that, in turn, can cause surprisingly persistent inflationary pressures across economies. However, these factors were underappreciated during the post-pandemic economic recovery. As a result, forecasts around the world under-predicted inflation. Forecasters may be able to do better in the future by tracking new indicators regarding shortages, various sources of pressure on supply chains, and changes in the frequency of price adjustments, especially when price setters see an upside risk to inflation.\nA second lesson is that credible inflation targeting is essential to keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored. Inflation targeting by central banks proved important during the post-pandemic economic recovery in achieving the monetary policy credibility that kept longer-term inflation expectations anchored. Recent research has provided support for this finding in both advanced and emerging economies.\n5\nAnd that is precisely why I am committed to supporting a monetary policy that keeps longer-term inflation expectations anchored.\nConclusion\nTo summarize, I see the U.S. economy as still being in a solid position, but heightened uncertainty poses risks to both price stability and unemployment. I will continue to monitor developments closely as I consider monetary policy decisions. When making decisions, I think it has been valuable to remain a student of economic history. Our recent past has provided some useful lessons for decision-making during periods of high uncertainty and elevated risks to our dual-mandate goals.\nThank you. I look forward to our discussion.\n1.

In addition to reaching the highest levels of the field in his own right, he was a trusted and generous mentor and teacher to a generation of the most important economic thinkers, including many heads of global central banks, advisers to presidents, and countless economists. We will miss him.\nCongratulations to Division of International Finance (IF) on 75 years of outstanding work in service to the Federal Reserve Board and, by extension, to all Americans. Many current staff members are here to celebrate today, as well as a number of IF alumni, including past division directors Ted Truman, Karen Johnson, Nathan Sheets, and Steve Kamin. The division has produced many other notable alums, including Chair and Secretary Janet Yellen; professor, author, chess grandmaster, and our keynote speaker, Ken Rogoff; and humanitarian and economist Albert Hirschman, famous for the Herfindahl\u00e2\u0080\u0093Hirschman Index and more recently as a character in Netflix's\nTransatlantic,\nto name just a few.\nIn my time at the Fed, the IF division has provided invaluable insight into global economic activity, international trade and capital flows, and developments in foreign financial markets. Division staff have also played a key role during episodes of global financial stress. And your research and analysis are critical inputs into our monetary policy decisions. Thank you to all that have served in this division over the past 75 years. Today I will kick off this conference by briefly reviewing why the division was created and highlighting a few of its many accomplishments over the years, before turning you over to a robust set of presentations and panels.\nNew Era for Global Economy\nThe IF division was created on July 1, 1950, but the idea began to germinate a few years earlier. The U.S. emerged from World War II as a global economic superpower. The Bretton Woods Agreement placed the U.S., and the Fed, in a central position in the global economy. Our mission then, as it is now, was to serve the American people. But it was clear at that moment that the Fed needed to have better knowledge of global developments to achieve our dual-mandate goals.\nA 1948 memo proposing to create this division stated, \"Problems of international economics and finance have become increasingly large, complex, and significant in recent years, and our foreign economic relations will undoubtedly continue to give rise to issues of the first magnitude.\" That is the rare economic forecast that turned out to be spot on!\nSeventy-five years later, it remains critical that the Fed understand the policies and practices of other governments and central banks, and their implications for the U.S. economy and financial markets. Exchange rate policy, of course, is now firmly in the hands of the U.S. Treasury. However, the end of the Bretton Woods era in the 1970s fundamentally changed the conduct of monetary policy, as policymakers had to understand the effects of potentially more volatile movements of the U.S. dollar on American families and businesses.\nUnderstanding global trade and capital movements has only grown in importance since 1950, as we saw during the pandemic. The IF division helps produce the data on international capital flows, and has spent decades researching the effects of these flows and international trade on U.S. and foreign economies. Understanding this complex and interconnected web is essential for us to anticipate the path of employment and inflation.\nAnother important development in the 1970s was the increasing use of macroeconomic modeling, which greatly influenced the division's work. Under the direction of former Division Director Ralph Bryant, IF developed its first multicountry model. Always on the forefront, over the years, economists in the division\u00e2\u0080\u0094many of whom are in this room today\u00e2\u0080\u0094developed increasingly sophisticated models, with each new generation expanding the capability to tackle the international risks and issues of the day. These models have proven useful for understanding how international shocks transmit through the economy and financial markets, for assessing risks and uncertainties through alternative scenarios, and for better comprehending the implications of various shocks for the U.S. and global economy. The results have informed research papers, Board memos and briefings, as well as the risks and uncertainty assessment that Federal Open Market Committee members receive in advance of every meeting.\nPrepared for Crisis\nThe IF division has also played an important role in responding to global economic turbulence. A prime example is the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s. That episode required analytical thinking about the macroeconomic repercussions of the crisis as it played out around the world. Work by division, and by the International Monetary Fund and other institutions, led to the establishment of emergency facilities to prevent more dire financial outcomes. As global capital flows increased, other episodes of financial distress surfaced across the world, including in Mexico, Asia, and Russia. International capital flows and spillovers became, and remain, a recurrent feature in the division's analytical and monitoring work.\nThe expertise generated through study and response to those global challenges proved invaluable when stress hit closer to home during the Global Financial Crisis and the pandemic. Both of those events required immediate, broad, and, in many cases, unprecedented responses to avoid disrupting the availability of credit to American households and businesses. The nation, and the world, looked to the Federal Reserve to lead in these moments. During the Global Financial Crisis, when global funding markets came under stress, the IF division worked to establish swap line arrangements with several major central banks that helped restore stability in U.S. dollar funding markets. And during the pandemic, the IF division helped lead efforts to expand the provision of dollar liquidity by setting up the FIMA Repo Facility.\n1\nThese periods of acute financial stress and uncertainty prompted the division to develop new tools and analytical products that could be used to understand and respond to the events unfolding on the ground. For instance, the division has devised new methods to measure and assess the effect of various types of uncertainty on economic activity, including new indexes that were built to track geopolitical risk, inflation, trade policy, and economic uncertainty. As we continue to navigate the current period of heightened uncertainty, this work is critical to understanding the quantitative implications of uncertainty shocks.\nConclusion\nI will conclude by saying that, for 75 years, nine Fed chairs and countless Board members have greatly benefited from the guidance and counsel of IF staff\u00e2\u0080\u0094and not just when responding to crisis. This team helps assure we are well prepared for our international engagements, by providing detailed materials ahead of time and often by traveling with us. IF staff are always welcome and productive companions. In these and other endeavors, we benefit from the robust relationships you establish and maintain with our global counterparts.\nThank you to Beth Anne and all the staff here that organized this wonderful event. And, finally, thank you again to all the current and former IF staff for what you have done and continue to do to help us be a globally knowledgeable and responsive central bank, so that we can deliver on our dual mandate for all Americans.\n1.

Waller\nAt \u00e2\u0080\u009cStructural Shifts and Monetary Policy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d 2025 Bank of Korea International Conference, Bank of Korea, Seoul, South Korea\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you to the conference organizers for inviting me to speak today. I have attended this conference several times and I'm honored to be on the program this year. Today, I will speak on the U.S. economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy.\n1\nI will focus my comments on two issues: first, the effects of tariffs on inflation persistence, and second, the divergence of household inflation expectations and financial market measures of inflation expectations.\nThe theme of this conference is structural shifts and monetary policy. The key structural shift that is affecting the economies of both the United States and South Korea is the recent change in U.S. trade policy, and a substantial share of my remarks will address how this shift is affecting the U.S. outlook.\nThe variability in tariff announcements this year, including the whipsawing of court rulings and doubling of metal tariffs last week, has created considerable uncertainty about where trade policy will settle. In mid-April, based on how things looked at the time, I proposed two scenarios to consider in framing an outlook and a preferred stance of monetary policy: a large tariff scenario and a smaller tariff scenario.\n2\nIn both cases, I assumed that the tariff increases would lead to a one-time boost to prices that would temporarily raise inflation, after which inflation would return to its underlying rate. This temporary increase could play\nout with a prompt rise in inflation that could recede quickly, or it could occur more gradually with a more modest increase that would recede more slowly. As I will explain, crucial to this judgment is my assumption that longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored.\nThe large-tariff scenario I described assumed an average, trade-weighted tariff for goods imports of 25 percent, which is close to where things stood after the 90-day tariff suspensions announced April 9, and my scenario assumed that this would remain in place for some time. In that case, I argued that inflation based on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index could reach a peak of 5 percent on an annualized basis this year if businesses passed through all of the tariff costs to consumers. If firms absorbed some of the tariff increase, then inflation might peak around 4 percent. I also argued that an economic slowdown from these higher costs could push the unemployment rate up from 4.2 percent to 5 percent next year.\nThe smaller-tariff scenario assumed a 10 percent average tariff on goods imports would remain in place but that higher country and sector specific tariffs would be negotiated down over time. In this case, inflation may rise to 3 percent on an annualized basis and then dissipate. Growth in output and employment would slow, with the unemployment rate rising but probably not as high as 5 percent.\nReported progress on trade negotiations since that speech leaves my base case somewhere in between these two scenarios. The temporary reduction in China tariffs has significantly decreased the trade-weighted average tariff, since China supplied about 13 percent of U.S. goods imports in 2024. But that reduction is only temporary and is due to increase if a trade agreement is not reached by August 12. Meanwhile, tariffs on other countries were temporarily lowered to 10 percent, but it is unclear where they will end up. Furthermore, the Administration continues to say that it plans additional tariffs on specific industries and sectors of the economy. Last week's court decisions declaring a large share of tariffs illegal introduce additional uncertainty, but there seem to be multiple options for maintaining tariffs, so I will stick with an estimated trade weighted tariff right now of 15 percent on U.S. goods imports, which falls in between my large- and smaller- tariff scenarios. I see the risks of my large tariff scenario having gone down, but there is still considerable uncertainty about the ultimate levels, and thus about the impact on the economic outlook.\nThe context for this uncertainty about tariffs is that hard data on the fundamentals of the economy lately has been mostly positive and supportive of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) economic objectives. There is very little evidence of the effect of trade policy in this data on inflation or economic activity through April, but that may change in the coming weeks. In comparison, there is evidence of tariff effects in the \"soft data\" based on surveys of consumers, businesses, and investors\u00e2\u0080\u0094indications of an expected slowdown in economic activity and an increase in prices. As of today, I see downside risks to economic activity and employment and upside risks to inflation in the second half of 2025, but how these risks evolve is strongly tied to how trade policy evolves.\nA careful examination of the hard data on overall economic activity through April shows it has been, on balance, positive. I say this because, while real gross domestic product contracted slightly in the first quarter, private domestic final demand, a measure of spending by consumers and businesses, grew at a healthy annual rate of 2.5 percent in the quarter. Of course, economic policy uncertainty among businesses is very elevated, and this has affected measures of sentiment and confidence for consumers and businesses, which fell to historically low levels in April. One index of this policy uncertainty compiled from newspaper stories, government reports, and the dispersion of the forecasts of private-sector economists rose in April to nearly twice the level seen during the pandemic and the Global Financial Crisis.\n3\nHowever, consumer sentiment rebounded with the announcement that the China tariffs had been lowered temporarily. And households' spending should continue to be supported by income from the resilient labor market. In addition, my business contacts have told me that, because of tariff uncertainty, their investment plans are currently on hold but are not canceled. So we may see a slowdown in investment in the near term but a jump back up later this year.\nWherever things end up on a continuum between my \"large\" and \"smaller\" scenarios, I do expect tariffs will result in an increase in the unemployment rate that will, all else equal, probably linger. Higher tariffs will reduce spending, and businesses will respond, in part, by reducing production and payrolls.\nWe won't get the jobs report for May until this Friday, but the consensus expectation is that employers added 130,000 jobs and that the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2 percent. We have seen a reduction in wage pressures over recent months, and the ratio of job vacancies to the number of unemployed people has moderated from as high as 2 a couple of years ago to close to 1 today, which was about where it was before the pandemic. With a balanced labor market, if aggregate demand slows noticeably, businesses will likely look to cut workers. But I believe job cuts would be modest if the smaller-tariff scenario is realized. Most chief executives I have spoken to say that they can maintain their current operations with an effective tariff of 10 percent, looking for efficiencies here and there, and won't have to significantly reduce their workforces.\nInflation\nNow let me turn to the outlook for inflation. Before the recent shift in U.S. trade policy, inflation had been making consistent, but uneven, progress over the past two years toward our 2 percent goal. While that progress seemed to stall at the beginning of 2025, it has resumed the past two months. The same pattern of higher readings at the start of the year, followed by lower readings the next couple of months, also occurred in 2024 and I expect that research will eventually reveal some residual seasonal effect or other factor that has affected at least some prices early in the year.\nTotal PCE inflation for April rose 0.1 percent, and core PCE inflation without energy and food prices increased by the same amount. It was the second monthly reading at 0.1 percent or less, and it means that headline PCE inflation was up 2.1 percent over the 12 months through April and that core was up 2.5 percent. In the absence of the tariff increases, I was expecting inflation would continue to be coming down nicely to our 2 percent goal. But now I expect that the effect of higher tariffs will raise inflation in the coming months. The surge in imports to build up inventories ahead of the April 2 announcement makes the timing of price increases somewhat uncertain.\nThinking about the rest of 2025 and 2026, I expect the largest factor driving inflation will be tariffs. As I said earlier, whatever the size of the tariffs, I expect the effects on inflation to be temporary, and most apparent in the second half of 2025. This will be determined not only by the ultimate size of the increase, but also by how exporters and importers respond, something that is highly uncertain. Will foreign exporters discount prices to try and preserve market share? Will domestic importers absorb some of the tariff increases to shore up demand\nand sales volumes? Will firms simply pass the entire tariff along to consumers? Since about 10 percent of personal spending goes to imported goods, if the ultimate tariff levels are closer to my 10 percent smaller-tariff scenario and if that is fully passed through to consumers, then the tariff would push up prices 1 percent. But based on my conversations with business leaders, I suspect the tariff cost will not be fully passed through and, instead, the burden will be distributed something like 1/3, 1/3, and 1/3 among consumers, importers and exporters. In this case, it would raise inflation three tenths of 1 percent for a short period. However, if the tariffs are higher than 10 percent, more of the increase is likely to be passed on to consumers, as businesses face limits in how much they can absorb and still find a way to remain profitable.\nI have also heard from business contacts that firms may choose to spread the tariff across non-imported goods. This would increase many goods prices a little instead of boosting import prices by a larger amount. But this approach would not affect the total impact of tariffs on the overall price level. Let me illustrate why using an example.\nImagine a firm selling 10 goods with equal sales revenue so that all have an equal weight of 1/10 when aggregating the firm's average price. Now assume one of the goods is imported. A 10 percent tariff on the imported good that is fully passed through raises the price of the imported good by 10 percent, while the prices of the other nine goods remain unchanged. This pricing strategy raises the average price of all goods by 1 percent. Now, instead, suppose the firm chooses a different strategy and decides to spread the tariff cost across all goods by raising all 10 goods prices by 1 percent. As a result, the price of the imported good increases much less, but the prices of the other nine goods now increase a bit even though they are not subject to tariffs. Under this strategy, the average price of the firm's goods still goes up 1 percent, and the tariff is fully passed through. So both pricing strategies have the same total effect on the aggregate price level across the firm and, if repeated, across the economy. The same logic applies to passing along the tariff via a sequence of smaller price increases instead of at a single point in time\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the end, the aggregate price level goes up by the same amount regardless of whether it is gradual or immediate.\nI have heard the concern that some firms may raise prices opportunistically while blaming the tariff increase. There is always a risk that firms blame some purported cost spike for a price increase, but it doesn't happen often because of the risk of losing market share to competitors or squandering the allegiance of loyal customers. So while this may happen in isolated instances, I do not believe it will be a significant source of additional inflation above and beyond the tariff-induced increase.\nInflation Persistence\nLet me now turn to the first of two issues about inflation that I want to cover in more detail. This is inflation persistence. The economics behind a tariff increase implies it should have a transitory effect on prices\u00e2\u0080\u0094tariffs raise prices once, but those prices don't keep going up. I know that hearing \"transitory\" will certainly remind many people of the consensus on the FOMC in 2021 that the pandemic increases to inflation would be transitory. Inflation turned out to be much more persistent than we thought it would be. Am I playing with fire by taking this position again? It sure looks like it. So why do I believe a tariff-induced inflation spike will not be persistent this time?\nLooking back to how inflation played out in 2021 and 2022, I believe there were three key factors that increased the persistence of the initial burst of inflation in 2021. First, there was a negative labor supply shock that was more persistent than expected. I believed that once the economy reopened, all of this labor would return. However, many workers left the labor market because of illness, or to care for children and family members, or took early retirement. They never returned. And with every wave of COVID-19, the United States experienced additional waves of early retirements that inhibited the labor supply from returning to its pre-pandemic level. Also, with the service sector shut down, demand surged for goods as spending on travel and other services halted and the negative labor supply shock led to a shortage of workers in goods production, delivery, and sales. Goods industries raised wages to attract workers and then once the economy began to reopen, service-sector firms had to pay higher wages to get workers back. This persistent shortage of labor from these several pandemic-related effects continued through 2021 and 2022 as job vacancies skyrocketed and firms had no choice but to pass along escalating wage increases in the form of higher prices.\nThe second factor driving inflation after the pandemic was that the supply chain disruptions that many expected to be temporary turned out to be more persistent. There were multiple waves of COVID affecting different regions of the world at different times, so that resolving production and transportation problems was constantly disrupted by the ebbing and flowing of the disease. One notable detail is that China's lockdowns lasted much longer than expected and played a",

Kugler\nAt the 2025 Federal Reserve Board Macro-Finance Workshop, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Olesya, and thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. It is such a pleasure to contribute to this conference.\nOur profession has increasingly recognized, especially after the Global Financial Crisis, that research in the interdisciplinary topics between macroeconomics and finance is indispensable both for monetary policy and for promoting financial stability. As a researcher myself, and having spent many years in academia, I place great value on the social contribution of research and its potential to improve policymaking.\nI want to express my appreciation for your efforts in using macro-financial data and theoretical models to enlighten us on several critical issues. For instance, let me cite a few topics of the conference that shed light on important issues:\nThe work on the transmission of monetary policy to both households and firms provides insights into how policy decisions ripple through the economy, a topic I recently addressed in a speech at the University of Minnesota. In this speech, I discussed my approach to monitoring monetary policy transmission and highlighted some of its key elements, such as the long and variable lags associated with policy effects.\nThe exploration of the neutral rate of interest\u00e2\u0080\u0094that which neither slows nor stimulates economic activity\u00e2\u0080\u0094provides another angle to this important concept. This is a topic I have addressed in previous remarks, and I am especially interested in the potential factors that can affect the neutral rate.\nThe work on how and why financial conditions faced by firms and households change with data releases and underlying macroeconomic conditions also enhances our grasp of the complex interplay between economic indicators and real-world financial experiences.\nThe research on the functioning of the Treasury securities market and how it is affected by regulatory constraints sheds light on a crucial aspect of our financial system.\nI commend you for pushing ahead with a research agenda that furthers our understanding of topics so relevant to our monetary policymaking.\nIn the spirit of stimulating your research appetite, I'd like to mention some topics that have captured my attention recently. These represent emerging challenges and opportunities in the field, and I believe they warrant further investigation.\nFirst, recently, I have been paying attention to the possible interaction between the financial vulnerabilities of firms and their exposure to trade. As global economic tensions rise and supply chains evolve, understanding how a company's financial health intersects with its international trade exposure becomes increasingly crucial. This research could provide valuable insights for both policymakers and business leaders navigating an uncertain global economic landscape.\nSecond, lately, I have been monitoring the financial stability implications of the potential lower desirability of U.S. financial assets in flight-to-safety events. Traditionally, U.S. assets have been seen as a safe haven during times of global economic uncertainty. One notable example of this was during the Global Financial Crisis. However, we recently saw instances in which the VIX went up, stock prices went down, long-term yields from U.S. Treasury securities went up, and the U.S. dollar depreciated against the currencies of advanced foreign economies (AFEs), with a notable role for the euro. Importantly, the historical relationships and the observed moves in the VIX and interest rates of AFEs would have been associated with a decrease in long-term yields from U.S. Treasury securities and an appreciation of the dollar. As the global economic landscape shifts, it is crucial to examine how possible changes in the role of U.S. financial assets as a safe haven might affect financial stability both domestically and internationally.\nLastly, I have been keenly interested, for some time now, in how stresses in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector could potentially spill over to the rest of the U.S. economy. The CRE sector continues to face challenges from low vacancy rates and valuation losses, especially in urban centers for the office sector. Another challenge is that some banks, insurers, and securitization vehicles continued to have concentrated exposures to CRE. As we have seen in past crises, such as the Global Financial Crisis, vulnerabilities in specific sectors can have far-reaching consequences for the financial system. Understanding potential vulnerabilities and potential domino effects are vital for maintaining overall economic stability and crafting preemptive policies.\nThese, I believe, represent some of the most pressing questions facing our field today. They offer rich opportunities for groundbreaking research that could significantly influence future policy decisions.\nIn conclusion, I want to reiterate my gratitude for the vital work you are all doing. Your research not only advances our understanding, but it also provides a solid foundation for informed policymaking. As we navigate the complex interplay of macroeconomics and finance in an ever-changing global landscape, the importance of your work cannot be overstated.\nI encourage you to continue pushing the boundaries of our knowledge, to ask the difficult questions, and to pursue the answers with rigor and dedication. Your efforts today will shape the policies of tomorrow, influencing the economic well-being of millions.\nThank you for your attention, and I look forward to the insightful discussions and presentations that will unfold during this conference.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            May 29, 2025",

Powell\nAt Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, President Eisgruber, for the opportunity to speak here today. Congratulations to the Princeton University class of 2025 on the tremendous achievement of earning your degree, and to the parents, family members, friends, and mentors whose support and encouragement made this day possible.\nFifty years ago, almost to the day, I was sitting where you are now, listening to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6a speaker\u00e2\u0080\u00a6deliver a speech\u00e2\u0080\u00a6neither of which I can recall. What I plan to do today is to share some things with you that I believe would have been useful for me to hear back then.\nFor those of you who are fundamentally unsure about your path, I was you. Rather than studying, I had spent my freshman year with fellow campus musicians playing my Martin D-35 acoustic guitar. It was a high school graduation present, one that my parents surely regretted.\nWhile I still play that guitar, my freshman grades said clearly that I needed to get my act together academically, and by senior year I had done so. But I had no real plan for life after Princeton. I grew up in Washington, D.C., and majored in politics. As you know, Princeton graduates have a long and distinguished record of service to the nation and to humanity. That left me with a single thought, which was that I wanted to have a private sector career and also serve periodically in government. I was thinking of people like Princeton's George Shultz, a giant of that era. There are countless other examples across the political spectrum, including presidents, senators, members of Congress, governors, and judges. Of course, most of those who serve are not public figures. I could just as well point to classmates who devoted their working lives to teaching high school kids\u00e2\u0080\u0094there is no higher calling.\nMany of my classmates and friends went straight into prestigious graduate schools, politics, or Wall Street. Others went on to global capitals, the military, or the Peace Corps. I had brushed off my parents' one academic suggestion, which was to major in economics, which struck me as boring and useless. After 13 years at the Fed, I admit I was wrong about that!\nAfter graduation, I had no plan and no job, and wound up putting labels on shelves in a warehouse for six months. I didn't feel great about that. One of my closest friends was getting a master's at Stanford, and I could only think\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"Nice going, Jay. You really nailed it.\" In hindsight, that time in the warehouse was a blessing, and exactly what I needed. The next fall I entered law school, and for the first time I was highly resolved to make the most of the opportunity.\nYou know what? We all move at our own pace, and that's ok. Fifty years later I can tell you something I did not know then: The vast majority of what you need to know about work, about relationships, about yourself, about life, you have yet to learn. And that itself is a tremendous gift. Over the remainder of your life, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0094you must\u00e2\u0080\u0094continue to educate yourself and to grow as a person, becoming more focused on what really matters, more widely knowledgeable, better read, more disciplined, and more strategic. But also wiser, kinder, more empathetic, more generous, more loving, more forgiving of others and of yourself. Each of us is a work in progress. The possibilities for self-improvement are limitless.\nAnother thing I have realized is that while hard work, determination, and creativity matter a great deal to success in life, luck plays a big role too. All of us here are tremendously lucky. I know that, at a handful of critical times in my life, I got really lucky\u00e2\u0080\u0094beginning at birth.\nMy parents were well educated. They gave the six Powell kids a safe, loving home, and placed a high value on learning. They gave us everything we needed to thrive. That bit of luck led to the good luck I share with all of you, the chance to earn a degree from America's finest university.\nAnother thing I have learned along the way is that, as you strive in coming years to reach your full potential, you will need to take risks and make mistakes.\nEveryone makes mistakes. Take it from an expert! But the bigger mistake is to avoid taking risks.\nIf you aren't failing from time to time, you aren't asking enough of yourself. Sooner than you think, many of you will be asked to assume leadership roles. It is very common to feel, as I once did, that you are not ready. Just know that almost no one is truly ready. All I can say is go for it! Throw yourself into the deep end of the pool. Believe in yourself. Take risks. When you fall down, get up! Repeat cycle. And as you do assume higher responsibility, understand that a big part of your job is to bring along the people behind you. Be the leader that people can learn from, the one that people want to work for.\nMy next point is closely related. A little bit of initiative, at the right time, can make all the difference. Initiative is the rocket fuel of life. I am no entrepreneur. I did not start a major tech company. But as I look back, many of the most important developments in my life trace back to a few occasions where I showed some initiative.\nOne example out of many\u00e2\u0080\u0094when I was a very junior associate, the man who ran my firm\u00e2\u0080\u0094Nicholas F. Brady\u00e2\u0080\u0094was a former U.S. senator whose career had spanned the private sector and public service. I wanted to meet him but realized that it was up to me to make that happen. One day I forced myself to walk up the stairs to his corner office. I asked for an audience and was ushered in. I was very nervous; the meeting was very brief; and I walked down those stairs thinking \"at least I tried.\" To my surprise, two months later Nick Brady asked me to work on a project with him. A year or so after that he became the Secretary of the United States Treasury, and in time he asked me to serve under him as an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. That enormously challenging role whet my appetite for further public service and ultimately proved to be a gateway for my appointment to the Federal Reserve Board. If I had not forced myself to take that risky and potentially awkward step, I would not be here today.\nI can think of long-term friendships and one marriage, my own, that turned on a moment's initiative. On occasions like that we risk failure, awkwardness, embarrassment, and rejection. But that's how we create the career opportunities, the great friendships, and the loves that make life worth living.\nThe combination of luck, the courage to make mistakes, and a little initiative can lead to much success. But know this: the world needs more from you than personal achievements and individual success. I strongly urge you to find time in your careers for public service.\nSince the founding of this great democracy 250 years ago, generation upon generation have assumed the burden and the honor of moving us closer to the ideal that all are created equal. Now, it's your turn. I ask you to take a minute and realize how the quest for these values has led us to this point in our history. We lead the world in so many ways, including in scientific innovation and economic dynamism. Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset. Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted. When you look back in 50 years, you will want to know that you have done whatever it takes to preserve and strengthen our democracy, and bring us ever closer to the Founders' timeless ideals.\nThose of you who are not entering the military or other public service may wonder, what is so great about public service? I'll give you a recent example. In my years at the Fed, the global economy has experienced a fair amount of turbulence, and one outright crisis\u00e2\u0080\u0094the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop. Critical financial markets were near collapse. The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder. Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, \"We got this.\" We took a range of aggressive measures to supply credit to the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0094many of them unprecedented\u00e2\u0080\u0094while the financial sector recovered. Others in government and the private sector did their part too. Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes. It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them. That's what public service is like.\nWith that luck that I mentioned comes great responsibility. You may recognize this from the Gospel of Luke: \"From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded.\"\nAs you navigate the world of bright possibilities that awaits you, I urge you to take on the challenge and the opportunity to serve your fellow citizens. You will never regret that choice.\nA very last, and critical point. Your life matters\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the people you love and to the broader world. Fifty years from now, you will want to be able to look in the mirror and know that you did what you thought was right, in every part of your life. At the end of the day, your integrity is all you have. Guard it carefully.\nThank you for your time. Congratulations to the Princeton class of 2025.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            May 25, 2025",

I am honored to be with so many friends in macroeconomics at the 2025 Women in Macro Conference. I still read, recommend, and cite your work and am grateful to New York University and the University of Chicago for supporting this conference and this research.\n1\nHow has the arc of mainstream macroeconomic research become more closely integrated with issues related to financial stability? This question is what I would like to discuss today. I applaud the advances in incorporating financial stability into macroeconomic models, which have significantly enhanced our understanding of financial market functioning and its effect on the economy. It is a topic that holds special importance to me as a macroeconomist who has worked at the intersection of macroeconomics and finance since my dissertation and as the chair of the Federal Reserve Board's Committee on Financial Stability. I would like to then offer my assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system.\nFinancial stability supports the objectives assigned to the Federal Reserve, including full employment and stable prices, a safe and sound banking system, and an efficient payments system. A financial system is considered stable when banks, other lenders, and financial markets are able to provide households, communities, and businesses with the financing they need to invest, grow, and participate in a well-functioning economy\u00e2\u0080\u0094and can do so even when hit by adverse events, or \"shocks.\"\n2\nFinancial instability, by contrast, arises when vulnerabilities\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as asset bubbles, excessive leverage, liquidity mismatches, or interconnected exposures\u00e2\u0080\u0094can build up to such an extent that they can amplify different shocks and threaten the core functions of the system and the functioning of the broader economy.\nMacroeconomic Research and Financial Stability\nThe idea that supply creates its own demand, or Say's law, was the prevailing economic orthodoxy of the 1800s. As a result, the core content of macroeconomics as a separate discipline did not exist. Prolonged periods of involuntary unemployment were considered to be impossible. Money and credit were thought to act as a \"veil\" with no real effects, so money was seen as neutral and banks and other financial intermediaries as essentially passive, despite what we now know.\nThe Great Depression fundamentally put an end to this comforting orthodoxy and prompted decades of work to better understand the causes of, and policy responses to, economic fluctuations. For the first time, financial factors took center stage in economic theory. Directly responding to the failures of economic theory exposed by the Depression, John Maynard Keynes introduced the concept of a \"liquidity trap,\" in which fear pushes the demand for money so high that the usual corrective measures become ineffective.\n3\nFriedrich Hayek and the Austrian school of economics emphasized the role of unsustainable credit booms, noting that booms in \"malinvestment\" would lead to fundamental mismatches that would need to be addressed.\n4\nDespite the early focus on panics, credit booms, and extreme dynamics, macroeconomic research evolved in a way that de-emphasized the role of the financial system, likely reflecting technical limitations and, more broadly, the need to develop policy frameworks for the post\u00e2\u0080\u0093World War II economy where the Great Depression seemed less relevant. Modeling financial crises requires addressing complex nonlinear dynamics, feedback loops, and discontinuities, like defaults and bank runs. All of these were analytically intractable and computationally unmanageable with the tools available at the time.\nAs a result, the macroeconomic framework that originated from the ideas of Keynes generally assumed stable and frictionless financial markets. The IS-LM, or Investment-Saving Liquidity Preference-Money Supply framework, which describes how the goods market and the money market interact to determine aggregate output and interest rates in the economy, emerged as the central analytical tool for understanding short-run output and interest rate dynamics.\n5\nHowever, the neoclassical synthesis was not without its critics. Joan Robinson argued that capital accumulation and investment behavior were inherently volatile and criticized the prevailing framework for overlooking important sources of instability.\n6\nMilton Friedman's work challenged the Keynesian paradigm by highlighting the importance of monetary policy and the destabilizing effects of monetary mismanagement.\n7\nEven as the rational expectations revolution in macro ushered in explicit modeling of micro foundations and dynamic optimization, financial intermediaries, credit frictions, and the potential for systemic crises remained largely absent. Neoclassical growth models prioritized capital accumulation and technological progress as drivers of long-run growth, and real business cycle models emphasized productivity shocks as drivers of fluctuations in employment and growth.\n8\nTwo papers familiar to many of you here and published in 1983 were instrumental in bringing financial stability considerations back into macroeconomic research. Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig showed how banks' role in providing liquidity makes them vulnerable to runs, while Ben Bernanke demonstrated how bank failures deepened the Great Depression.\n9\nThese contributions, which were recognized with a Nobel Prize in 2022, have helped pave the way for researchers wishing to explore both directions of the relationship between financial fragility and macroeconomic outcomes. In parallel, Hyman Minsky's financial instability hypothesis advanced a dynamic view of systemic risk, emphasizing how periods of sustained economic and financial stability tend to encourage excessive leverage and risk-taking\u00e2\u0080\u0094culminating in what we now call a \"Minsky moment.\" This phenomenon is when a rapid unwinding of financial positions triggers broader economic distress.\n10\nUltimately, it took the Global Financial Crisis to bring home just how deeply the financial system and macroeconomic dynamics are intertwined, as evidenced by the explosion of research on financial stability and financial frictions. Models incorporating financial intermediaries, leverage cycles, and endogenous risk became more central to macroeconomic analysis, while empirical work confirmed the critical role of credit booms in preceding financial crises.\n11\nOver the past few years, macroeconomic research, to which some of you have contributed, continued to incorporate important financial stability aspects, ranging from endogenous leverage and bank runs to models studying the effects of monetary policy in the presence of heterogenous banks.\n12\nMuch of this research is also being done at the Fed, and it has informed our current work in the area. I thought it would be helpful to describe some of that work to you.\nMonitoring Financial Stability\nCentral banks around the world routinely monitor the financial system for risks, because financial crises can lead to severe recessions. A cornerstone of the Fed's work in this area is our framework for monitoring and assessing vulnerabilities. The most recent version of our semiannual\nFinancial Stability Report\n(FSR) was released last month.\n13\nOur framework distinguishes between two fundamental elements: shocks and vulnerabilities.\n14\nShocks are adverse events that by their nature are difficult to predict and, unfortunately, are all too frequent. Recent examples include the pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and many geopolitical events that still warrant headlines. Vulnerabilities, which are aspects of the financial system that would amplify stress, tend to build up over time and can be identified and assessed. We monitor vulnerabilities in four key categories: asset valuation pressures, household and business borrowing, financial-sector leverage, and liquidity and maturity transformation, or funding risks. Policies to build resilience in the financial system are appropriately targeted at reducing vulnerabilities, because they do not require foreknowledge of any particular shocks.\nThe financial cycle is recognized as being lower in frequency than the business cycle, with vulnerabilities building over years and typically only to be crystallizing in a short-lived stress event\u00e2\u0080\u0094the classic dynamic of going up by the stairs but down by the elevator.\n15\nFurther, as I mentioned earlier, vulnerabilities often build during prolonged expansions as, for example, investor optimism leads to greater tolerance of risk, excess borrowing, and increased leverage. The realization of stress and associated contraction can put these forces into reverse, resulting in decreased vulnerabilities. But the economic and human costs of such an adjustment can be significant.\nFinancial Stability Assessment\nOur most recent FSR reflects data and information generally available as of April 11, a point when financial market volatility and risk-off sentiment were elevated, with, for example, the S&P 500 having fallen more than 10 percent from its prior peak. Nonetheless, the report echoes many of the themes that we had been highlighting for the previous couple of years. I will discuss our most recent report in the context of some of those themes and illustrate a few lessons from the April volatility.\nLet me start with one theme that is quite encouraging. Generally, businesses and household finances are in solid shape. Most households are able to service their debt, and overall household debt relative to GDP has declined over the past five years. While we are seeing some stress among low-to-moderate-income borrowers and those with subprime credit scores, the risks posed by overall household borrowing remain moderate. Stable balance sheets and solid income have supported the ability of most nonfinancial businesses to service their debt. At the same time, smaller and riskier businesses\u00e2\u0080\u0094which tend to have lower debt service capacity, measured by the interest coverage ratio\u00e2\u0080\u0094are sensitive to income shocks.\nMost households are able to service their debt, and overall household debt relative to GDP has declined over the past five years. While vulnerabilities posed by overall household borrowing remain moderate, we are seeing some signs of stress among borrowers with subprime credit scores, which include many low- and moderate-income households. For instance, auto and credit card delinquency rates for borrowers with subprime credit scores increased substantially in 2022 and 2023 and are at or near their highest levels since the financial crisis. More generally, a sufficiently large income shock could strain the debt-servicing capacity of a broader group of households and push up delinquency and default rates, resulting in more substantial losses for lenders.\nAsset prices have fluctuated significantly over the past several years. Although we do look at asset prices, we tend to focus more on \"valuations pressures,\" which essentially measure how much prices differ from a variety of benchmarks. For instance, we care whether prices, relative to measures of risk, appear to be out of step with historical experience. In such circumstances, the potential price declines\u00e2\u0080\u0094should risk appetite revert to historical averages\u00e2\u0080\u0094would be larger than normal. Additionally, when the compensation for risk is low, borrowing or leverage could also increase and put further upward pressure on valuations. Coming into the April volatility, valuation pressures were elevated, consistent with the strong economy.\nAllow me to discuss our view of valuation pressures in property markets and come back shortly to the imprint of the April volatility on stock and bond prices. The significant rise in house prices during and after the pandemic has slowed substantially over the past couple of years, but price-to-rent ratios and model-based valuation measures are around the record levels last seen in 2005. Two key differences are that lax underwriting standards do not appear to have driven the increase in house prices and owners' equity appears to be more solid, using both price- and model-based measures.\nWe also noted that commercial real estate (CRE) valuations had been elevated going into 2022 but declined significantly through the period of higher interest rates and deteriorating CRE fundamentals. Prices and fundamentals appear to have moderated, and valuations are closer to historical norms. Given the significant volume of CRE that is maturing and will need to be refinanced, I am continuing to watch this market closely.\nLet me now turn to financial system leverage and funding risks. Capital in the banking system continues to be at historically high levels. However, as you no doubt remember, the intersection of interest rate and liquidity risks played a prominent role in the March 2023 banking-sector stress. High reliance on funding from uninsured deposits was a key vulnerability among some of the most affected banks, including those that failed. When higher interest rates resulted in substantial unrealized losses, we observed rapid outflows of uninsured deposits from a handful of banks. In the April FSR, we describe how over the past couple of years, the share of uninsured deposits relative to total bank funding has decreased for most banks, especially for those that previously relied heavily on uninsured deposits. This outcome is a welcome signal. However, sizable exposure to fixed-rate assets remains, suggesting ongoing exposure to interest rate risk.\nSince 2019, our FSRs have noted another development in markets\u00e2\u0080\u0094a decline in market liquidity. \"Market liquidity\" refers to the cost of quickly buying or selling a desired quantity of a security and being able to do so without having a significant effect on the market price. During periods of asset-price volatility, it is not surprising that liquidity often declines, so we consider whether market liquidity measures are low given the level of volatility. As discussed in previous FSRs, some evidence indicates that a number of measures of liquidity have shifted down over time, particularly in Treasury markets, where volatility has also been relatively high.\n16\nWe have done a lot of work, as have others, to analyze the causes and what lower liquidity in normal times may imply for market f",

Kugler\nAt the Economics Commencement Ceremony, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Stefano, and before I say anything else, congratulations to the Class of 2025!\n1\nMy family is here today, so let me acknowledge my husband Ignacio, my daughter Miri, my son Danny, and my parents who are watching from elsewhere. I start with family because I know it takes a village! So, I want to acknowledge the enormous accomplishment by the graduates and also by their families and friends who supported them through this journey. Let's give all of them a big round of applause! I also want to thank the leaders of Berkeley's economics program for giving me the privilege of returning here, as a graduate of this program, to be a part of what is, in fact, my very first economics commencement ceremony here at Berkeley.\nOn a similar spring afternoon in 1997, when my classmates were walking across this stage, I was across the country, hurrying to finish my dissertation at the Brookings Institution and preparing to start my first job as an economist. I would have loved to be here, as you are, and I praise you for taking the time to share with your classmates, friends, and family this moment of recognition for the huge achievement today represents. But somehow, at the time of my graduation, I felt the need to get on with earning a living and moving forward with my life, as I am sure many of you are eager to do also.\nSo, you can understand that this is a very special\u00e2\u0080\u0094and also a little strange\u00e2\u0080\u0094 moment for me because it feels, in a way, like I am celebrating my own graduation 28 years later! I think it is also an unusual situation for all of you to listen to this speaker who was once where you are today. It is unusual because standing at this podium now is not just the person I have become in the decades since leaving Berkeley. Standing beside me, very close by today, is also the young woman I was in 1997, who was too busy to attend her own graduation. You will be hearing at times from both of us today, and we may even exchange a few words with each other.\nThis sounds a little like that Aubrey Plaza movie you may have seen last year, in which a young woman gets advice from her older self. Unfortunately, unlike Aubrey Plaza's character, I cannot help my younger version through the many challenges that she will face, and let me tell you, there were many challenges indeed, and yet here I am! Nevertheless, because of my proximity, today, to that younger self, I hope I can see the world a little more through your eyes, when I try to offer some words of wisdom. I know, I know, commencement speakers are expected to provide wisdom and advice. But really, today, I would like to mainly tell you that the wisdom and also the conviction of my younger self are what allowed me to navigate the challenges along the way. So, trust yourselves!\nAs I have indicated, the younger version of me was quite impatient to get her professional life started and try to make a mark in the world. The older me would say, \"Take your time, figure out who you are, who you will become! Life is long, and among other things, life teaches you to have patience to work for big goals.\" There is merit to this advice, of course, but today I am thinking about how I felt when I was in your shoes, and I am thinking that one of the underappreciated gifts of younger people is, in fact, impatience. I will say more about this, but if you take a look around at all the many urgent challenges we face here in the U.S. and the world, many of which depend on the powerful tool of economics and its potential to make people's lives better, then I would certainly say that some impatience is, indeed, very much what we need.\nI speak of economics as a tool because that is all that it is. It is not a philosophy, a value system, or a religion, although I acknowledge that some in our profession might treat it that way. Economics can't answer all the questions we face in our lives. Economics can't tell us how to treat each other, or what kind of world we should strive to create, but it is a means to those ends.\nAnd even the answers that economics\ncan\nprovide are always evolving, as our understanding of economic behavior and phenomena evolves. What we understand in economics has evolved in the years since I left Berkeley, and it will continue to evolve. While this understanding does change over time, I think of it as changing like the California landscape changes. Some towns and cities grow, some decline, and there is the occasional earthquake to shake things up. But the landmarks that guide us in economics\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Golden Gate, the Sierra Nevada\u00e2\u0080\u0094they have been standing for a while now, and I believe they will continue to stand for a long time to come.\nUsing these landmarks, these foundational and time-tested insights, economics can indeed be a powerful tool. But it is a tool, only to the extent, like any other tool, that it is useful. A brilliant insight, if not applied, or tested, or employed for some useful purpose, is like the gadget you pick up at the hardware store and never use. It is just taking up space in the toolbox. When economics reveals how to use resources efficiently, how to raise production and income and lower costs, these insights are only useful if they are applied\u00e2\u0080\u0094if they win in the marketplace of ideas.\nAs you embark on your careers as economists, and the myriad ways in which you can employ the knowledge and skills you have acquired, one cause that I hope you all will embrace is actively participating in this marketplace of ideas. I hope you do, because, from the level of the individual household to the loftiest decisions of business leaders and government, employing the foundational insights of economics is the difference between prosperity and the utterly avoidable lack of prosperity.\nIt is tempting to think that time-tested and broadly accepted ideas are permanent. In fact, the debate has never ended on many foundational ideas of economics, some of which can seem counterintuitive to people. These are ideas that must be fought for, because, as I said, to lose that fight is to go backward and accept less prosperity.\nAmong the aspirations that each of you hold as you leave the Greek theater today, I hope that you will use what you have learned at Berkeley to be part of this fight. I would go further and argue that, along with the diplomas that you are receiving today, you will also carry with you a special responsibility to promote these principles and use them to promote greater prosperity for all. I am not shy in saying that economists have such a responsibility, nor in saying that the learning you have acquired qualifies you to be an active participant in these debates. I believe\nyour\nexpertise matters, because, in the cacophony of opinions, and trolling, and disinformation that seems to crowd ever more into the marketplace of ideas each year, I cling to the idea that expertise still matters. In his book\nThe Constitution of Knowledge: A Defense of Truth\n, Jonathan Rauch argues that, just as important as America's written Constitution is an unwritten one, based on a widespread agreement on what is true and what is not true. Knowledge, he writes, as it is added to and preserved over time, is a special glue, that Gorilla clear and precise super glue, that helps to hold society together and settle many conflicts. Expertise matters as the basis for that knowledge. When your expertise as economists is absent, when your voices are absent from the debate, knowledge suffers, and we are all poorer because of it.\nLet me pause for a moment because I am hearing from my younger self just now that these commencement remarks are maybe getting a little heavy. I can understand how she feels. Think about how things looked in 1997. The Cold War was over! The tech boom was just taking off, which meant that Oakland was still affordable. Honestly, in hindsight life back then sounds a lot less complicated than it seems today. My first job was at Pompeu Fabra University in Spain, and my second was at a large public university, the University of Houston. I had some research ideas, mostly in the area of labor economics, and I found some great collaborators, and I was off to the races. Today, I realize that colleges and universities are facing challenges like never before, which means that the prospect of trying to make a career in academia is much less certain.\nPublic service is another traditional destination for economists, and I have been very fortunate to be able to move forward in my career as an academic, while taking time out on three occasions to work in Washington\u00e2\u0080\u0094as chief economist at the Department of Labor, as the U.S. executive director at the World Bank, and now as a governor at the Federal Reserve Board. By contrast, it is, of course, to put it mildly, a very challenging time to be thinking about starting a career in public service, at least at the federal level.\nI can stand here today and lament the new challenges faced by you and by many others in the Class of 2025. I am a mom, and my kids are also facing new circumstances. But I also look back sometimes and wonder how I got here. And this is another case where I believe the 27-year-old me had more wisdom than I do. If she were crossing this stage today, with you, facing these undeniable challenges, I do not think she would be discouraged. She would stubbornly say: \"I love economic research; I will find a way to become an academic.\" If you told her about the challenges facing colleges and universities, she would say that it is simply unthinkable that America would not support the greatest post-secondary educational system in the world. And if you told her that a pendulum swing in opinion might limit opportunities in public service, she might say: \"If the purpose of life is helping others, (and I think it is) then public service will be valued, and it is something I must do, and that I will do.\"\nI think if you had told the 27-year-old me that she could not achieve these things, which she dreamed of, she would stubbornly refuse to accept it. And of course, this is the way that humankind eventually solves most big problems. More than anything else, it is stubborn determination, which I hope is in good supply among you already, and which I encourage you to cultivate. You have already, of course, one of the greatest assets that anyone can have to make a career in economics, which is an education from one of the greatest universities in the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094the University of California, Berkeley. When I attended here, I had the privilege of taking classes with four winners of the Nobel Prize, and many people tell me that, if anything, the faculty is even stronger today. In my recent work at the Fed, I have had occasion to cite research by six current faculty members in public speeches. You have learned from the best, and with your energy, expertise, impatience, and stubborn determination, I know that nothing will stop you! Whatever you choose to do, I hope you will make use of what you have learned at Berkeley to be an active part of that marketplace of ideas. Go forth from here and make the world a brighter and better place. Go seize the day as you head out Sather Gate! Congratulations, again, Class of 2025, and thank you.\n1.

Jefferson\nAt \"Financial Intermediation in Transition:  How Will Policy Adapt?\" 2025 Financial Markets Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Fernandina Beach, Florida\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, President Bostic, for that kind introduction and for the opportunity to talk to this group today.\n1\nI am delighted to be here, and I look forward to discussions at this important conference.\nThe theme of today's conference is developments in financial intermediation and potential implications for monetary policy. As this conference embarks on a larger discussion of the role of banks and nonbanks in various market segments\u00e2\u0080\u0094including credit markets, Treasury and money markets, and payments\u00e2\u0080\u0094I believe it is worth taking a step back to explore an important background factor, which is how and why central banks provide liquidity.\nslide 1\nslide 2\nThe provision of liquidity by central banks is a foundational element of financial intermediation. Central banks should be able to provide liquidity effectively for the financial system to function smoothly. Today, I will take this opportunity to discuss some aspects of liquidity provision by the central banks. Of course, the main forms of liquidity provided by central banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094namely, currency and bank reserves\u00e2\u0080\u0094are the foundation of safe liquidity in the economy. It is vital for a central bank to make clear that it stands ready to provide liquidity should stress emerge. But a central bank must also take steps to minimize moral hazard. \"Moral hazard\" in this context refers to the concern that publicly provided liquidity might encourage private financial institutions to take on excessive risk.\nWhat I would like to focus on in this speech are two types of liquidity provision that aim to reduce the frictions associated with the basic operations of banks. The first type of liquidity is intraday credit, which is key in handling payment system frictions during the day, and the second one is overnight credit, which deals with a range of frictions.\n2\nI will also highlight some design features of broadly similar liquidity facilities in three other advanced economies: the U.K., Japan, and the euro area. I believe it is valuable to look at other central banks' experiences with liquidity provision, which entails recognizing the important differences that exist across jurisdictions and mandates and considering what lessons can be learned.\nAt their core, liquidity facilities support the smooth operation and stability of the banking system, the effective implementation of monetary policy, and the furtherance of a safe and efficient payment system. This activity in turn supports the flow of credit to businesses and households. Last year, the Federal Reserve Board issued a public request for information (RFI) seeking to identify operational frictions in these facilities, and those comments are under review. I hope that today's discussion about how facilities operate in the U.S. and around the globe can further that dialogue among participants at this conference.\nHow It Works in the U.S.\nLet me start by discussing how liquidity provisions work in the U.S., as summarized in\nslide 3\n. Banks maintain deposit accounts at the Federal Reserve (Fed). The balances in these accounts, known as reserves, are the most liquid assets that banks have and are used to meet payment flows as households and business customers of banks carry out their regular business. Banks often experience mismatches in the timing of payment inflows and outflows, which could occasionally cause the balance in a bank's account at the Fed to become negative. To help institutions manage this mismatch and promote the smooth functioning of the payment system, the Fed extends intraday credit, also known as daylight overdrafts.\nIntraday credit facilities provide temporary credit to depository institutions such as commercial banks and credit unions to foster the smooth functioning of the payment system. If a bank temporarily lacks the funds to process payments, it can use intraday credit to avoid delaying payments until it has sufficient liquidity. The Fed provides intraday credit on both a collateralized and an uncollateralized basis. Collateralized intraday credit is provided free of charge, whereas uncollateralized credit incurs a fee. Since this type of credit is provided on an intraday basis, the Fed expects banks to have positive balances in their accounts by the end of the operational day. If a bank has a negative balance at the end of day, it incurs an overnight overdraft and pays a penalty.\nThe Fed also provides overnight credit through the discount window to approved counterparties against a broad range of collateral. This type of liquidity provision is designed to mitigate short-term misallocations of liquidity. For example, a bank may need to settle a large payment at the end of the day, but it may temporarily have insufficient funds in its account to do so. To meet the payment obligation, the bank could borrow in private interbank markets\u00e2\u0080\u0094in which financial institutions lend funds to each other on a short-term basis\u00e2\u0080\u0094or from the central bank. The rate on overnight credit also helps central banks with monetary policy implementation. In addition, overnight liquidity facilities often serve as a first line of defense against stresses, and they stand ready to provide liquidity when institutions face outflows.\nAll discount window loans are collateralized, and a wide range of bank assets, including a variety of loans and securities, are eligible to serve as collateral.\n3\nThe Fed operates three separate facilities under the discount window: primary credit, secondary credit, and seasonal credit.\nThe first one, primary credit, is available to generally sound banks at a rate that is currently set at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate. Providing liquidity at this rate supports the implementation of monetary policy because institutions can turn to the Fed if conditions tighten in money markets that might otherwise push overnight money market rates above levels that would be consistent with the Fed's target range. As I noted earlier, primary credit also helps deal with idiosyncratic funding challenges that banks might be experiencing. Most of the funding provided is on an overnight basis; however, funding is available for up to 90 days.\nThe next one, secondary credit, is available to banks that are not sufficiently healthy to have access to primary credit. It is available at a higher rate, features higher haircuts on collateral, and is limited to overnight credit.\n4\nThe third facility, seasonal credit, provides short-term liquidity to smaller institutions that experience sizable seasonal fluctuations in their balance sheets. Typically, these are banks located in agricultural or tourist areas.\nShort-Term Credit Provision across Jurisdictions\nLooking at central banks' experiences across jurisdictions provides useful insights about different approaches to providing liquidity.\n5\nCentral banks choose a combination of interest rates, collateral requirements, collateral valuation practices, and other design features to encourage usage of facilities while minimizing undesired consequences\u00e2\u0080\u0094in particular, moral hazard. For example, a central bank facility that provides liquidity at an attractive interest rate could be very effective in ensuring that shocks to the financial system do not disrupt the flow of credit but may potentially increase moral hazard. If that facility only accepted a narrow set of high-quality collateral, however, then the moral hazard associated with it could be reduced. Alternatively, the usage of a facility that charges an interest rate above the market rate (a so-called penalty rate) is likely limited, but if the facility accepted a broad range of collateral, usage can be encouraged.\n6\nIn these two examples, the counterbalancing choices are with respect to the interest rate charged and the eligible collateral. Different central banks might prefer one approach over the other depending on specific aspects of their frameworks and banking systems.\nOf course, there are challenges in comparing liquidity facilities across jurisdictions given important differences with respect to central banks' legal authorities, monetary policy frameworks, the size of the economy and financial sector, and institutional structures. This divergence is also true across the four advanced economies that I will consider today: the U.S., the U.K., Japan, and the euro area. There can be large differences in each jurisdiction's banking sector and central bank balance sheets relative to the size of their economies, highlighting the need to use caution when comparing aspects of their liquidity provision.\nWith that caveat in mind, let's look at the design features of some foreign central bank liquidity facilities that are fairly similar to the Fed's discount window. As shown in\nfigure 1\n, the Bank of England (BOE) operates two such short-term facilities: an operational standing facility and a discount window. The operational standing facility features lower rates but restricts acceptable collateral to high-quality, highly liquid sovereign debt. The discount window facility accepts a broader range of collateral but charges a higher rate.\nWhich facility an eligible borrower turns to in the U.K. depends on the sorts of collateral that are being pledged. In the U.S., whether an institution has access to primary or secondary credit depends on the condition of the borrower. The BOE monitors borrower conditions, and the Fed also sets haircuts on collateral based on asset riskiness. The differences in design considerations could influence how eligible borrowers integrate these facilities into their regular liquidity management practices.\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) has two facilities: one that provides overnight loans and another that provides somewhat longer-term funding up to three months. Because the BOJ has been operating a system with a very large supply of reserves for some time, its lending facilities tend not to be used extensively, other than in stress periods.\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) operates a marginal lending facility quite similar to the Fed's discount window. It can meet the idiosyncratic funding needs of individual banks and serves as a ceiling on interbank rates and thus helps the ECB implement monetary policy. This facility is an important element of the ECB framework even though the ECB's approach to monetary policy implementation involves providing the banking system with a sizable amount of reserves through weekly (repo) lending operations.\n7\nThe international differences show that central banks can accomplish their objectives using facilities with quite different designs. As I noted earlier, one of the vital purposes of a short-term liquidity facility is to be able to provide support to the banking systems during stress. The Fed, the BOE, the BOJ, and the ECB have been able to do so.\nFigure 2\nshows short-term credit provision over time for the four central banks: the BOJ, the green line; the Fed, the black line; the ECB, the blue line; and the BOE, the red line.\n8\nEach line is the monthly short-term credit outstanding as a share of central bank assets in 2019. This figure illustrates a few important points.\nFirst, at most times, use of the short-term central bank liquidity facilities is modest. Second, central bank provision of short-term liquidity can increase very rapidly during times of stress.\n9\nFor example, the Fed and the ECB provided substantial short-term liquidity during the 2007\u00e2\u0080\u009309 financial crisis. Third, the figure also illustrates that stress is not always global in nature and peak usage does not necessarily coincide. For instance, short-term liquidity provision rose in the euro area during the European sovereign debt crisis that began in late 2009 and peaked in 2012, but it did not increase much in the U.S. Similarly, short-term liquidity provision increased in the U.S. during the March 2023 banking stress episode, but it did not increase in the euro area. I also want to highlight that during stress events, central banks complement their regular short-term standing liquidity facilities with other facilities. Therefore, stress events may not necessarily result in an increase in liquidity provision through a short-term standing facility.\nNow let's turn to more recent developments. Over the past few years, as central banks have shrunk their balance sheets, liquidity has been gradually reduced, which has made the existing liquidity provision tools more relevant. The BOE and the ECB have indicated that they are moving toward operating frameworks in which short-term liquidity providing repo operations will play a key role.\n10\nThe Fed has stated that it will continue to operate in an ample-reserves regime. In this regime, the primary credit rate is positioned to be slightly above the rate expected to prevail in interbank markets so use of the discount window should typically remain modest. Still, the facility remains available to be used.\nFigure 3\nshows the discount window credit as a share of Fed assets over the past decade. As you can see from this figure, over the past few years, the discount window has been used more than was the case before the pandemic. Increased usage may be due to the discount rate being set closer to private market rates than was the case before the pandemic, the availability of longer maturity loans, and shifts in communication.\nIntraday Credit Provision across Jurisdictions\nJust as there are differences with respect to the provision of overnight liquidity across central banks, there are also differences in the provision of intraday credit. One difference is with respect to unresolved intraday overdrafts. As I noted earlier, it is possible for banks to incur overnight overdrafts if they fail to take such action as requesting an overnight loan, although overnight overdrafts are not considered business as usual and carry a penalty rate in the U.S., currently set at the primary credit rate plus 400 basis points.\n11\nThe BOJ does something quite similar. By charging a high penalty on overnight overdrafts, both the Fed and the BOJ discourage overdrafts.\nIn contrast to the Fed and the BOJ, the ECB and the BOE can automatically convert most of the intraday overdrafts into an overnight loan from the business-as-usual facility seamlessly, without action on the part of the bank, against the same collateral at the end of the day.\n12\nThat feature creates a greater similarity between intraday credit and overnight credit in those jurisdictions. The relationship between intraday credit and overnight credit is going to be an important one for centra",

Barr\nAt the 2025 Northeast / Mid-Atlantic Small Business Credit Symposium, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, New York (via pre-recorded video)\nShare\nAccessible Keys for Video\n[Space Bar]\ntoggles play/pause;\n[Right/Left Arrows]\nseeks the video forwards and back (5 sec );\n[Up/Down Arrows]\nincrease/decrease volume;\n[M]\ntoggles mute on/off;\n[F]\ntoggles fullscreen on/off (Except IE 11);\nThe\n[Tab]\nkey may be used in combination with the\n[Enter/Return]\nkey to navigate and activate control buttons, such as caption on/off.\nGood afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity to be part of the Small Business Credit Symposium.\n1\nSmall businesses are the backbone of our economy, and yet they face significant challenges. As a researcher and public official, I have spent considerable time working on these issues, and today, I would like to address three critical challenges that small businesses face: access to capital, skills development, and network building. Then, given my role as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, I'll offer my perspective on the impact of economic conditions and the outlook on small businesses and provide some details on the vital role that small businesses play in our economy.\nThe first challenge facing small businesses that I'll highlight is access to capital and credit. Small businesses access credit from diverse sources, including banks of all sizes, credit unions, online lenders and other nonbank financing companies. Nevertheless, entrepreneurs and small business owners face a significant gap, relative to larger businesses, in accessing capital. According to the Federal Reserve's Small Business Credit Survey (SBCS), credit availability is a challenge faced by over a quarter of small businesses.\n2\nIn addition, many small businesses worry about the cost of credit and confusing terms and conditions in some credit offers. And still others are discouraged from even applying for credit and so are unable to start or grow their businesses. Minority entrepreneurs and those located in low- and moderate-income areas often have an even harder time than other businesses in accessing credit in safe and affordable ways.\n3\nThere are many ways to help address these gaps. For example, in Detroit, I was fortunate enough to work with colleagues to help set up a loan loss fund serving small businesses in Detroit, Michigan. The loan loss fund helps banks to reach deeper into the small business market by mitigating downside risks to lending. Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) can also play important roles in expanding access to small business credit, especially in underserved areas. Fintech providers can use lower cost structures and technological innovations to serve small business owners as well. Federal and state governments have a role to play as well, such as through SBA programs, the CDFI Fund, and the State Small Business Credit Initiative.\nIn addition to the credit gap, many small businesses often face a knowledge and skills gap. Many entrepreneurs and small business owners start their firms without the range of financial and management skills needed to run a successful business.\n4\nAnd it's not always easy for entrepreneurs to identify or develop the specific skills and knowledge they need to grow and sustain their businesses. Bridging this knowledge gap may require a variety of approaches. For instance, many organizations, both private and public, have developed information and training to help small business owners establish and grow their businesses. Online learning platforms, payment platforms, small business development centers (SBDCs), chambers of commerce, and community colleges, for example, develop and provide information tailored to the various needs of small business owners and entrepreneurs.\n5\nFocusing on practical skills, such as financial management and operations planning, can help build the capacity for greater knowledge and skill acquisition.\nIn my own experience with this challenge, I had the privilege of working with colleagues to launch the Detroit Neighborhood Entrepreneurs Project, which brings faculty-supervised student teams to collaborate with local businesses on their legal, financial, design, marketing, business strategy, and technology challenges. The interdisciplinary program helps to bridge the skills and resource gaps that small businesses owners face, while students learn important new skills themselves from both faculty and the small businesses that they serve.\nThe third challenge facing small business owners and entrepreneurs is the need to cultivate strategic connections and build robust professional networks that support their growth and success. Business and professional networks often provide entrepreneurs and small business owners with access to critical resources and knowledge. While established entrepreneurs have actively cultivated these connections and all that they can offer, emerging entrepreneurs and new small business owners often don't know where to start. Accessing networks of experienced entrepreneurs can help early-stage entrepreneurs and small business owners gain perspectives that will be vital for growing their firms. Business associations and member organizations that connect owners and staff at companies of all sizes can facilitate knowledge sharing. Even more importantly, these business networks can help to expand market access. Many years ago, for example, I helped to establish BusinessLINC, which brought together established businesses and budding entrepreneurs.\nThose are a few of the challenges I have observed over the years, and some thoughts on how to address them. With the time remaining, let me turn to my current vantage point and the question of why small businesses are so vital to a healthy and growing economy. In part, this is because small businesses, to a great extent,\nare\nthe U.S. economy. Businesses with 500 or fewer employees account for almost half of all private sector employment, nearly 40 percent of the sales revenue of businesses, and nearly 40 percent of what is paid to private sector workers.\n6\nBut this actually understates the impact of small businesses, because they are especially important for economic growth. We know that the overwhelming number of new businesses are small businesses, and we also know that new businesses are a particularly potent source of innovation and productivity growth.\n7\nOne of the reasons that the U.S. economy has done so well the past few years is because of an acceleration in productivity growth, which, together with immigration increasing the labor force, allowed our economy to grow resiliently while inflation was falling. It is no coincidence that this productivity surge occurred while the creation of new businesses was also surging.\n8\nFor instance, small businesses are responsible for 16 times as many patents per employee as larger businesses. Small businesses play an important role in innovation and economic growth.\n9\nIn my view, the economy is on solid footing, with solid growth, low and stable unemployment, and inflation continuing to come down towards our 2 percent target. But the outlook has been clouded by trade policies that have led to an increase in uncertainty, contributing to declines in measures of consumer and business sentiment. Potential disruptions to supply chains and distribution networks are particularly acute for small businesses, which are less diversified, less able to access credit, and hence more vulnerable to adverse shocks. Small businesses play a vital role in production networks, often providing specialized inputs that can't easily be sourced elsewhere, and business failures could further disrupt supply chains. As we saw during the pandemic, such disruptions can have large and lasting effects on prices, as well as output. If these disruptions were to occur, we'd likely see lower growth and higher inflation ahead.\nThat's the macro view. At the level of individuals and households, small businesses are a vital basis for financial security and economic mobility. Outside of stockownership and retirement savings, home ownership is responsible for 45 percent of household non-financial wealth, with business equity right behind at 34 percent.\n10\nThose who are self-employed, as most small business owners are, have an average of four times as much wealth as those who are employed by others, and twice as much as retirees. Successful entrepreneurship also correlates strongly with upward mobility, with studies showing business owners more likely to move into higher income brackets than their non-entrepreneurial counterparts.\n11\nThese opportunities matter a great deal to individuals, families and communities, and they also matter in promoting a strong economy with stable prices and low unemployment, key to the Fed's mission. I look forward to hearing more about the insights from today's event and working with all of you to encourage entrepreneurship and small business ownership, which is so vital to our economy.\n1.

I am pleased to welcome everyone here today. Thomas Laubach's research and support of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) helped us better understand monetary policy, and it is fitting that this work will continue today in his name. Thank you to the authors of the papers, to the discussants, and to our panel participants. Thank you also to Trevor and his team for organizing this conference; a lot of work went into bringing us together.\nAs in our last review, the 2025 review consists of three key elements: this conference,\nFed Listens\nevents at Reserve Banks around the country, and policymaker discussions and deliberations, supported by staff analysis, at a series of FOMC meetings. In the current review we will reconsider aspects of our strategic framework in light of the experience of the last five years. We will also consider possible enhancements to the Committee's policy communication tools, regarding forecasts, uncertainty, and risks.\nTitle slide\nThe Consensus Statement\nIn 2012, the FOMC first codified our monetary policy framework in a document entitled the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which we refer to as the consensus statement.\n1\nThe language in the opening paragraph, which has never changed, articulates our commitment to fulfilling our congressional mandate and to explaining clearly what we are doing and why (\nfigure 1\n).\n2\nThat clarity reduces uncertainty, improves the effectiveness of our policy, and enhances transparency and accountability.\nAs Chair, Ben Bernanke led the Committee through the creation of that initial consensus statement, adopting a 2 percent inflation target, and outlining our approach to achieving our congressionally assigned dual mandate. The framework laid out in that document broadly aligned with best practices for a flexible inflation-targeting central bank.\nThe structure of the economy evolves over time, and monetary policymakers' strategies, tools, and communications need to evolve with it. The challenges presented by the Great Depression differ from those of the Great Inflation and the Great Moderation, which in turn differ from the ones we face today.\n3\nA framework should be robust to a broad range of conditions, but also needs to be updated periodically as the economy and our understanding of it evolve.\n2019\u00e2\u0080\u009320 Review\nFrom 2012 to 2018, the FOMC voted at each January meeting to reaffirm the consensus statement, in most years without substantive changes.\n4\nIn 2019, we changed that practice, conducting our first-ever public review, and said that we would repeat such reviews at roughly five-year intervals. There is nothing magic about a five-year pace. We believe that frequency is appropriate to reassess structural features of the economy and to engage with the public, practitioners, and academics on the performance of our framework. Several of our global peers have adopted similar approaches to their framework reviews.\nAt the time of the last review, we had been living for about a decade in a new normal characterized by proximity to the effective lower bound, with low interest rates, low growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve. If I could capture that era with one statistic, it would be that the policy rate had been stuck at the lower bound for seven long years following the onset of the Global Financial Crisis in late 2008 (\nfigure 2\n). After liftoff in December 2015, we were able to raise the policy rate only very gradually over a period of three years to a peak of just 2.4 percent. Seven months later, we began reducing it, leaving the rate at 1.6 percent in late 2019, where it would be when the pandemic arrived a few months later. Policy rates in other major advanced economies were even lower, in many cases below zero, and in all such economies, inflation regularly ran below its target.\nThe sense at that time was that when the economy next experienced even a mild downturn, we would be right back at the lower bound, probably for another extended period. The post\u00e2\u0080\u0093financial crisis decade had demonstrated the pain that could bring. Inflation would likely decline in a weak economy, raising real interest rates as nominal rates are pinned at zero. Higher real rates would further weigh on job growth and reinforce the downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations.\nReflecting these concerns, we adopted a policy to make up for persistent shortfalls from the inflation target, an approach that was common in the extensive literature on the risks associated with the lower bound.\n5\nGiven the downside risks to employment and inflation from proximity to the lower bound and the need to anchor longer-term inflation expectations at 2 percent, we said that following periods in which inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we would likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\nWe also concluded that policy decisions would be informed by assessments of \"shortfalls\" rather than \"deviations\" from maximum employment. The change to shortfalls was not a commitment to permanently forswear preemption or to ignore labor market tightness.\n6\nRather, it signaled that apparent labor market tightness would not, in isolation, be enough to trigger a policy response, unless the Committee believed that, if left unchecked, it would lead to unwelcome inflationary pressure.\nThis change reflected our experience with long expansions that featured historically low unemployment amid low and stable inflation, suggesting that a policy approach that carefully probed for the maximum level of employment could bring about the benefits of a strong labor market without risking price stability. In the years just prior to the pandemic, for example, unemployment was at multidecade lows while inflation ran below 2 percent. By December 2019, estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate had fallen sharply (\nfigure 3\n).\n7\nThe use of \"shortfalls\" acknowledged that a combination of low inflation and low unemployment does not necessarily pose an adverse tradeoff for monetary policy.\nThe economic conditions that brought us close to the lower bound and drove the changes in our consensus statement were thought to be rooted in slow-moving global factors that were likely to persist for an extended period\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least until our next five-year review.\n8\nAnd that might well have been the case had the pandemic not intervened.\nThe idea of an intentional, moderate overshoot proved irrelevant to our policy discussions and has remained so through today. There was nothing intentional or moderate about the inflation that arrived a few months after we announced our changes to the consensus statement. I acknowledged as much publicly in 2021.\n9\nWe fell back on the rest of the framework, which called for traditional inflation targeting.\nThrough the end of 2021, FOMC participants continued to forecast that inflation was likely to subside fairly quickly in 2022, with only a moderate increase in our policy rate. That projection was consistent with other central banks with different frameworks and the vast majority of forecasters (\nfigure 4\n).\n10\nWhen the evidence showed otherwise, we hiked 525 basis points over a period of 16 months. The most recent data suggest that 12-month PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation was 2.2 percent in April, far below its 7.2 percent peak in 2022.\n11\nIn a welcome and historically unusual result, this disinflation has come without the sharp increase in unemployment that has often accompanied a campaign of rate hikes to reduce inflation.\nThe economic environment has changed significantly since 2020, and our review will reflect our assessment of those changes. Longer-term interest rates are a good deal higher now, driven largely by real rates given the stability of longer-term inflation expectations. Many estimates of the longer-run level of the policy rate have risen, including those in the Summary of Economic Projections (\nfigure 5\n).\n12\nHigher real rates may also reflect the possibility that inflation could be more volatile going forward than in the inter-crisis period of the 2010s. We may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks\u00e2\u0080\u0094a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks.\n13\nWhile our policy rate is currently well above the lower bound, in recent decades we have cut the rate by about 500 basis points when the economy is in recession.\n14\nAlthough getting stuck at the lower bound is no longer the base case, it is only prudent that the framework continue to address that risk.\nWhile the framework must evolve, some elements of it are timeless. Policymakers emerged from the Great Inflation with a clear understanding that it was essential to anchor inflation expectations at an appropriately low level. During the Great Moderation, well-anchored inflation expectations allowed us to provide policy support to employment without risking destabilizing inflation.\n15\nSince the Great Inflation, the U.S. economy has had three of its four longest expansions on record.\n16\nAnchored expectations played a key role in facilitating these expansions. More recently, without that anchor, it would not have been possible to achieve a roughly 5 percentage point disinflation without a spike in unemployment.\nKeeping longer-run inflation expectations anchored was a driving force behind establishing the 2 percent target in the 2012 framework. Maintaining that anchor was a major consideration behind the changes in 2020. Anchored expectations are critical to everything we do, and we remain fully committed to the 2 percent target today.\n2025 Review\nIn the current review, the Committee is engaged in discussions about what we have learned from the experience of the past five years. We plan to complete consideration of specific changes to the consensus statement in coming months. We are paying particular attention to the 2020 changes as we consider discrete but important updates reflecting what we have learned about the economy, and the way those changes were interpreted by the public. In our discussions so far, participants have indicated that they thought it would be appropriate to reconsider the language around shortfalls. And at our meeting last week, we had a similar take on average inflation targeting. We will ensure that our new consensus statement is robust to a wide range of economic environments and developments.\nIn addition to revising the consensus statement, we will also consider potential enhancements to our formal policy communications, particularly regarding the role of forecasts and uncertainty. As we have been reviewing assessments of the 2020 framework and of policy decisions in recent years, a common observation is the need for clear communications as complex events unfold. While academics and market participants generally have viewed the FOMC's communications as effective, there is always room for improvement.\n17\nIndeed, clear communication is an issue even in relatively placid times. A critical question is how to foster a broader understanding of the uncertainty that the economy generally faces. In periods with larger, more frequent, or more disparate shocks, effective communication requires that we convey the uncertainty that surrounds our understanding of the economy and the outlook. We will examine ways to improve along that dimension as we move forward.\nLet me end by saying thank you again for being here. We have been looking forward to the conversations that will occur over the next two days. These discussions will help broaden and deepen our thinking about these issues, and they are critical to the success of these reviews.\n1.

The first paragraph of the current consensus statement was the second paragraph of the initial statement in 2012. That initial consensus statement began with the following language: \"Following careful deliberations at its recent meetings, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has reached broad agreement on the following principles regarding its longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.

Jefferson\nAt the Annual Conference of Second District Directors and Advisors, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, New York\nShare\nThank you, President Williams. It is wonderful to be back in New York, and it is an honor to speak to you, the directors and advisers to the Second District. You all play an extremely important role for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and, indeed, for the entirety of the Federal Reserve System. You, and your peers around the country, inform President Williams and the other Bank presidents about how you see the economy unfolding in your communities and in your industries. The presidents, in turn, share that vital information with all the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) so that we can make the best monetary policy decisions to benefit all Americans. Thank you for the important contributions.\n1\nTitle slide\nIn the spirit of sharing information, I thought it would be helpful to share with you my economic outlook. First, I will discuss how I see recent economic activity. Next, I will talk about developments pertaining to both sides of our dual mandate, maximum employment and price stability. Finally, I will offer my current view of monetary policy.\nEconomic Activity\nWhile the economy entered a period of heightened uncertainty this year, the underlying data through the first quarter showed resilience. As you can see in\nfigure 1\n, gross domestic product (GDP) contracted slightly by 0.3 percent in the first quarter, on an annualized basis, after expanding at a 2.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 2024. That change, however, overstates the deceleration in activity. A surge in imports apparently ahead of anticipated changes to trade policy did not seem to be reflected fully in inventory or spending data. That misalignment complicated the interpretation of measured GDP data. Private domestic final purchases, which exclude government spending, inventory investment, and net exports, usually gives a better read than GDP on the underlying momentum in the economy. That came in at a 3 percent rate in the first quarter, consistent with readings from last year.\nLooking at\nfigure 2\n, you can see that inflation-adjusted consumer spending was strong much of last year. Spending eased at the start of 2025, which could in part reflect poor weather and seasonal adjustment challenges. Spending bounced back in March, perhaps reflecting some purchases ahead of expected trade policy changes.\nOf course, those observations of first-quarter economic activity are now in the rearview mirror. Tariff announcements and heightened uncertainty about government policies in general are the dominant economic developments of more recent weeks and have caused me to look carefully at my forecasts. It is not my role to express views on policies coming from the Administration or Congress, but I do study the implications of those policies on economic activity and inflation.\nVarious surveys show a decline in business sentiment related to trade policy. The Beige Book reported that some retailers are expecting to raise prices in response to tariffs, which could then limit spending, especially by the most price-sensitive consumers. Manufacturers saw risks of supply chain disruptions related to trade policy changes. Moreover, uncertainty is quite high. As a result, I have adjusted down my expectations for economic growth this year, but I see the U.S. economy as continuing to expand. Of course, trade policy is still evolving, so its ultimate economic implications are not known, and I will be following developments carefully.\nLabor Market\nTurning to the labor market, conditions continue to be solid. As you can see in\nfigure 3\n, the unemployment rate was 4.2 percent in April. It has fluctuated within a narrow and historically low range between 4 and 4.2 percent since the middle of last year. U.S. employers added 177,000 jobs to payrolls last month, effectively matching the average growth over the past six months. Payrolls have been rising at a pace consistent with a stable unemployment rate and a flat labor force participation rate. Hiring has slowed from the rapid pace recorded earlier in the current expansion, but layoffs remain historically low. That can be seen in\nfigure 4\n. New applications for unemployment benefits this year remain in the same low range recorded over the previous three years.\nLooking at\nfigure 5\n, you can see the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers was at 1 in March, well down from a peak of 2 in 2022. The measure is consistent with a labor market that looks to be in balance and is not a source of inflationary pressure. Looking ahead, I am watching for signs that the labor market could cool as tariff increases begin to weigh on economic activity.\nInflation\nRegarding inflation, recent data are consistent with further progress toward our 2 percent inflation target; however, that goal has not yet been reached. Looking at\nfigure 6\n, the blue line shows inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has trended down from a peak above 7 percent in mid-2022. In March, PCE prices advanced 2.3 percent from a year earlier. Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile consumer energy and food prices and is usually a better indicator of future inflation, the dashed red line, was at 2.6 percent.\nFigure 7\nshows the components of core PCE inflation, which can provide insight into sources of inflationary pressures. Housing services inflation, the purple dotted line, has fallen notably since early 2023 and could continue to provide support to the disinflation process. Core services inflation, the dashed red line, has largely moved sideways since the early part of last year, contributing little to further disinflation, and I largely expect that pattern to continue as well. In contrast, goods inflation, outside of food and energy, the blue line, has picked up a bit this year.\nThere is much uncertainty, however, around the future path of inflation. If the increases in tariffs announced so far are sustained, they are likely to interrupt progress on disinflation and generate at least a temporary rise in inflation. Whether tariffs create persistent upward pressure on inflation will depend on how trade policy is implemented, the pass-through to consumer prices, the reaction of supply chains, and the performance of the economy. Short-term inflation expectations have increased in both survey- and market-based measures, but I think it is notable that most measures of longer-run inflation expectations have been largely stable, suggesting that the American people understand the Federal Reserve's commitment to return inflation to our 2 percent target.\nWhile trade policy has received the bulk of recent attention, I remain focused on the aggregate effect from the totality of different government policy changes, including trade, immigration, regulatory, and fiscal policies, as well as their net effects on the economy. This net effect will likely remain uncertain for some time.\nMonetary Policy\nLast week I supported the FOMC's decision to hold the federal funds rate at current levels as the best policy to achieve our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. As you can see in\nfigure 8\n, the FOMC acted last year to reduce the policy rate by a full percentage point. Over the past several meetings, the rate has been held at what I view as a moderately restrictive level. I view the current stance of policy as well positioned to respond to developments that may arise.\nWith respect to the path of the policy rate going forward, I will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Various measures of consumer and business sentiment have declined sharply this year, and I will be watching very carefully for signs of weakening economic activity in hard data. At the same time, higher tariffs could lead to higher inflation this year. It is uncertain whether inflationary pressures would be temporary or persistent. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. With the increased risks to both sides of our mandate, I believe that the current stance of monetary policy is well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.\nConclusion\nThe uncertain economic outlook presents a challenge for monetary policymakers. It is critical that we have the best available information from a broad cross section of sources, which is again why your efforts to keep President Williams and other monetary policymakers informed are so critical. Effective policymaking starts with hearing from people in every corner of this country\u00e2\u0080\u0094including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Directors and advisers like you make that possible. Thank you again.\n1.

Waller\nAt the Award Ceremony for the Winners of the Bank Al-Maghrib Prize for Economic and Financial Research, Bank of Al-Maghrib, Rabat, Morocco\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nI have spent most of my career conducting research and overseeing research by others, first as a professor and later as a research director in the Federal Reserve System. More recently, I have been more of a consumer than a producer of research as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Eight times a year, the FOMC meets to set the appropriate stance of monetary policy to achieve the economic goals assigned to us by the U.S. Congress. We discuss where the economy stands in relation to those goals, how it is likely to evolve, and the implications for monetary policy. We examine hard statistical data, \"soft\" data in the form of surveys and input from business contacts, and other domestic and global factors.\nAnother vital input for central bankers is economic research. Nearly all central banks have a research group to help policymakers think through the effects of monetary policy on the economy. In the Federal Reserve, the 12 regional Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors have staffs that perform a variety of research activities. First and foremost, they use research to advise the Governors and Bank presidents on the appropriate path of monetary policy given current events. Second, they provide analysis of the global, U.S., and regional economies. Third, economists at the Reserve Banks meet with businesses in their Districts to discuss economic issues and to collect information about the local economy. Finally, there are research groups around the Federal Reserve System that focus on banking, payments, financial markets, financial stability, and community development.\nThe word \"research\" is used very loosely in everyday life. When I was a professor, my undergraduates would do \"research\" to write a term paper. When I go on vacation, I often do \"research\" on what to do or see at my destination. Analysts at financial institutions do \"research\" on individual firms or sectors of the economy. For today's talk, I narrow in on the types of research done at central banks, with a focus on the Federal Reserve.\nResearch at the Federal Reserve\nResearch is a vital input for providing state-of-the-art advice to policymakers within the Federal Reserve System. Because the Fed is accountable to the public, policymakers must be able to explain why certain actions were taken and describe the intellectual foundations underlying those decisions. Decisions are analyzed, discussed, and criticized by many, in particular by highly skilled and knowledgeable academic researchers. Top academics are on the cutting edge of research, particularly on the subject of monetary policy. Milton Friedman, Allan Meltzer, Robert Lucas, John Taylor, and Michael Woodford are just a few examples of academic scholars who challenged central bankers over the past 70 years on how monetary policy should be conducted. Central banks must be up to the challenge and be able to debate and compete with these academics in the world of theory and ideas.\nTo do that requires hiring central bank economists who are trained in the academic research tradition and continue working at the research frontier. And that means pursing academic research at central banks. Our decisions will be better if we hire motivated and well-trained economists and let them work on the big questions that economics seeks to answer. The Federal Reserve tries to create a strong academic research environment to attract strong researchers to work at the Federal Reserve to give us a better foundation for the decisions we make.\nWhen I was research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, I told our board of directors that my goal was to build a department that was renowned for producing high-quality academic research. They often responded by saying, \"But the Federal Reserve is not a university. Rather than doing academic research, why isn't your staff doing research on issues that you direct them to work on that helps the president of the Bank?\" This is a great question and one that should be asked at every central bank. To answer that question, I would start by explaining the difference between academic research and directed research, which I will now do today. Once I have, it will be clear that directed research relies on its grounding in academic research and is a complement to directed research in supporting policymaking.\nAcademic Research\nAcademic research considers a broad range of economic matters. It often focuses on issues that are currently off the radar screens of policymakers who are focused on the near-term economic outlook. But there is value in thinking broadly. Not too long ago, trade policy and tariffs were not a major concern of policymakers. A critical aspect of academic research is that it is often \"proactive\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094it focuses on intellectually interesting issues often before they become relevant for monetary policy.\nAcademic research conducted by Federal Reserve economists is often done with the goal of publishing it in academic journals. Papers submitted to these journals go through a rigorous vetting process by economists outside the central bank. This serves as an important check on central bank \"group think.\" The ideas and conclusions of the paper must be based on sound economic theory and empirical evidence. They cannot reflect dogma or outdated beliefs about how the economy operates.\nAcademic research can take the form of an evaluation of major economic events, sometimes called an \"economic autopsy.\" This type of analysis can take years, and it's not particularly time sensitive. To this day, economists are still researching the causes of the 2008 financial crisis and how policies undertaken at that time helped or hindered the subsequent economic recovery.\nDirected Research\nThen there is directed research. Directed research is just that\u00e2\u0080\u0094an issue or policy problem that staff economists are told to work on by their supervisors. It is not unrestricted thinking about an issue. Often, directed research addresses an emerging topic that demands attention from policymakers. As a result, directed research is usually reactive in nature. It often has the feel of firefighting\u00e2\u0080\u0094an issue flares up, and policymakers must respond. They need analysis of the problem to think about the issue and how to act. For example, the April 2 tariff announcement was larger and more extensive than nearly anyone expected. Immediately, questions were asked of staff around the Federal Reserve System such as, \"What will this do to the U.S. economy? What will happen to inflation and unemployment?\" The answers to these questions are obviously time sensitive.\nDirected research often involves running shocks though existing economic models or quick data analysis and it relies on existing economic research. One could call the results \"quick and dirty\" answers. Because this work is time sensitive, central bank researchers do not have the luxury of getting their directed research vetted by the economics profession. They simply figure out how the current issue can be incorporated into the models or analyzed with econometrics, and whatever answer comes out is the best they can do in the time they have.\nBecause directed research is often reactive and time sensitive, researchers must rely on existing published research as a key input into their analysis. You cannot come up with original or innovative models on the spot to deal with an issue that suddenly appears. And, on the data front, you may not have the time to look deeply at the microdata. In these situations, existing academic research done by central bank economists and by academics outside the central bank provides the foundation for conducting the directed research. This is why I say that academic research is a complement to directed research. Good directed research requires academic research. Furthermore, postmortem analysis is not always done after directed research is completed. Once the issue goes off policymakers' radar screens, it might not be looked at again. If the issue resurfaces at a later date, then there may be some postmortem investigation into earlier analyses to see what went right and what went wrong.\nFinally, directed research sometimes takes the form of analysis involving the gathering and organizing of facts and data to generate a simple narrative for less specialized audiences. The Beige Book\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is a survey of regional economic conditions done by the Reserve Banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a clear example. But it also takes other forms, such as talks by research economists to private-sector audiences, presentations to the Reserve Bank boards of directors, or writing about timely topics in short economic posts.\nHistory of Research at the Federal Reserve\nEconomic research has shaped monetary policy at the Federal Reserve from its very beginnings, but the form and use of that research has varied considerably over time. I do not have the time today to give this topic the justice it deserves. But I will touch on a few historical highlights. During the early decades of the Federal Reserve System, \"research\" at the Fed was largely limited to the collection of statistics, only some of which were published by the Fed and other government agencies. At the Reserve Banks, the focus was often on measuring and reporting on regional economies or sectors.\n2\nMonetary policy decisions were made using policy frameworks that were often not tested in the rigorous and scientific ways associated with economic research today. For example, in the 1920s, the Federal Reserve adhered to the \"real bills\" doctrine that called for providing liquidity to businesses when it was demanded during expansions and contracting credit when demand for it fell during times of slowing growth.\n3\nThis, of course, is often exactly the opposite of what monetary policy should do to either control inflation in an overheating economy or support economic activity in a slowdown.\nUp until the 1950s, journal-oriented economic research in the Federal Reserve System was quite limited. But a big increase took place in the 1950s, when the Reserve Bank presidents became much more involved in monetary policy decisions.\n4\nBefore that, Bank presidents focused mainly on local operations and discount window policy. But once they became more involved in national-level policymaking decisions, their new responsibilities required them to have more specialized research staff who were trained in modern economic theory and data methods. The creation and development of professional research departments led to a greater debate within the Federal Reserve and among outside academics as to how monetary policy should be conducted.\nIn the 1960s, Keynesian macroeconomic theory was the dominant paradigm in policymaking, and large-scale econometric models were being developed to provide quantitative analysis of monetary policy. The Board of Governors led the way by hiring Ph.D. economists from academia to develop and use these Keynesian models and econometric techniques to aid policymakers. This was an important first step in raising the skill level of research staff to match that of top academics.\nBut the beauty of the Federal Reserve's structure is that alternative macroeconomic frameworks and theories could be developed in the rest of the System. And the first example of an alternative view of monetary policy was developed by research economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and became a force to be reckoned with.\nIn the early 1970s, after inflation failed to fall as much as expected in a slow economy, Fed Chairman Arthur Burns came to believe that inflation was very little affected by economic slack and was instead a structural problem that could only be dealt with through wage and price controls.\n5\nBoard models typically viewed the 1970s inflation as being driven by special factors that were outside the influence of monetary policy. In contrast, at the St. Louis Fed, monetarism was the dominant paradigm in thinking about monetary policy. The Bank's researchers believed the 1970s inflation was driven by excessive monetary growth.\n6\nThis led to a vigorous debate throughout the 1970s between Board staff and St. Louis Fed economists over the sources of inflation and how to bring it back down. At the end of the 1970s, Paul Volcker became Chair of the Federal Reserve and essentially adopted the St. Louis monetarist position of halting monetary growth to bring inflation under control. He announced a fundamental change in the Fed's policy approach, vowing to bring inflation down by adopting strict monetary growth targeting. Volcker succeeded, but at the cost of causing a severe recession.\nIn the 1980s, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis became a dominant force in monetary policy research by proposing new economic theories and policy frameworks. In association with economists at the University of Minnesota and the University of Chicago, researchers at the Minneapolis Fed explored how rational expectations would affect the transmission channel of monetary policy. Up until then, Fed forecasting models assumed that individuals had adaptive expectations, meaning they were purely backward looking. This meant that the Board's econometric models didn't account for policy actions that were announced in advance but hadn't taken effect yet. If households and firms did understand how current policy actions and announcements would affect future outcomes, they would react in ways that didn't match the predictions of the Board's forecasting models. This would lead to significant errors in the guidance that the staff provided to policymakers.\nA critical finding of all this research was that private agents' inflation expectations were forward looking\u00e2\u0080\u0094they would adjust to promises, and failures, of central bankers to keep inflation low and stable. If people didn't believe a central bank's promise to keep inflation low, then the central bank lacked credibility. This would cause inflation expectations to increase, which would lead to demands for higher nominal wages, thereby feeding future inflation. It is now widely believed that this was a key problem that Volcker faced: His promises to bring inflation down were not fully credible, as they came after the Fed's uneven efforts at fighting inflation over the previous decade. Research on monetary policy, along with the experience of the Volcker years, led to the concepts of \"credibility\" and \"stable inflation expectations\" becoming central parts of how every central bank enacts policy.\nA key innovation at the Minneapolis",

Kugler\nAt the International Economic Symposium, cohosted by the National Association for Business Economics and the Central Bank of Ireland, Dublin, Ireland\nShare\nThank you, Reamonn. It is an honor and a privilege to be asked to speak in the beautiful country of Ireland and here at the Central Bank of Ireland. The histories of the U.S. and Ireland are intertwined. Our friendship is enduring, and our economies are closely tied. The Irish economy and the Bank stand as examples of the benefits of being open to international connections and the sharing of the best ideas and practices. I am delighted to have the opportunity to meet with my counterparts here and continue this great friendship. It is also wonderful to see many members of the National Association for Business Economics (NABE). NABE and its members have made many important contributions to the field of economics; as such, I always enjoy speaking to this esteemed group.\n1\nI am particularly delighted to contribute to this conference on trade, technology, and policy. As an academic, part of my research has investigated the link between trade and productivity. And in my current role, I have highlighted these themes in several of my recent speeches, including the role of recent advancements in technology, such as artificial intelligence, as well as the role of business formation in terms of boosting U.S. productivity over the past few years.\n2\nToday, I would like to focus my attention on the current outlook for the U.S. economy and how I am thinking about the path of monetary policy. Of course, given current developments, I will focus on the role played by trade policy and how it may affect the economy and productivity going forward.\nWhile the latest data show a resilient economy, I expect growth this year to be slower than last. Labor market conditions have been mostly stable. Inflation remains above the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent target, and further progress on disinflation has been slow. Looking ahead, I am monitoring the effects of changing trade policies, as I see them as likely having a significant effect on the U.S. and global economies in the near future.\nTrade policies are evolving and are likely to continue shifting, even as recently as this morning. Still, they appear likely to generate significant economic effects even if tariffs stay close to the currently announced levels, and the uncertainty associated with these tariffs has already generated effects on the economy through front-loading, sentiment, and expectations. Let me start by describing how I see current economic conditions.\nEconomic Activity\nRegarding overall economic activity, it is currently hard to judge the underlying pace of growth of the U.S. economy, as the gross domestic product (GDP) release for the first quarter showed strong evidence of front-loading of imports ahead of tariffs. GDP contracted at a 0.3 percent annual rate in the first quarter after expanding 2.5 percent during 2024. However, the latest GDP figure likely overstates the deceleration in activity, as a 41.3 percent surge in imports apparently did not get fully picked up in the inventory data or other components of spending. The size of the swings in imports may make the measurement of activity more difficult.\nIt is helpful to look at private domestic final purchases (PDFP), a measure of demand in the private sector: It rose at a rate of 3 percent in the first quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0094similar to the pace recorded last year. Still, the strength in PDFP also likely reflects some pull-forward of purchases by businesses and consumers to get ahead of tariffs.\nThe Federal Reserve's April Beige Book and conversations with contacts also point toward front-loading in auto sales or other high-end goods. However, the Beige Book and various indicators of consumer and business confidence also point to a downbeat tone about underlying economic activity down the road. For instance, the Beige Book notes that several Districts see a deterioration in demand for travel and other nonfinancial services and indicates that businesses may put investments on hold moving forward. Several other economic indicators that I track suggest some signs of declining economic activity in the future. For instance, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing purchasing managers index for April shows that new orders have been declining since February.\nLabor Market\nOn the employment side of our mandate, conditions seem to be mostly stable. The most recent employment report showed that employers created 177,000 new jobs in April, in line with the average of the previous six months. The unemployment rate was 4.2 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0094still within the narrow and historically low range of 4 to 4.2 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0094where it has remained since May of 2024. In addition, the pace of layoffs remains modest. New applications for unemployment benefits have remained relatively stable at historically low levels. However, I am carefully watching other sources of data for any signs that the labor market could be shifting, given the broader uncertainty. Some forward-looking measures of layoffs have increased, such as the number of mentions of the word \"layoff\" in the Beige Book.\nIn terms of the demand for workers, the U.S. Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed that the vacancy rate\u00e2\u0080\u0094the number of vacant jobs as a percentage of total employment and vacant jobs\u00e2\u0080\u0094declined to 4.3 percent in March, the lowest in six months. The government data showed that the ratio of vacancies to the number of unemployed Americans was 1.0 in March, below its 2019 average of 1.2\u00e2\u0080\u0094also indicating the continuing easing of U.S. labor markets. Overall, job growth remains positive, and unemployment is still low, but I am watching a broad range of incoming readings carefully.\nInflation\nOn the other side of our dual mandate is inflation. After two years of notable progress following U.S. inflation reaching its pandemic-era peak, progress on disinflation has slowed since last summer. Inflation remains somewhat above the FOMC's 2 percent goal. At the Fed, the inflation reading we track most closely is the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. The March report, released on April 30, showed that the 12-month change in the PCE price index was 2.3 percent; the core PCE price index\u00e2\u0080\u0094which excludes food and energy prices\u00e2\u0080\u0094rose 2.6 percent over the same period.\nTo help me judge the path of future inflation, I pay careful attention to two subcategories of the index. One is core goods prices, which exclude volatile food and energy prices. The second is nonhousing market-based services, which are based on transactions such as car maintenance and haircuts, not imputed prices. Goods inflation was negative for most of 2024\u00e2\u0080\u0094as was the norm for several years before the pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it was positive early this year. In contrast, nonhousing market services inflation stayed elevated through March, coming in at 3.4 percent. That category often provides a good signal of inflationary pressures across all nonhousing services. Looking ahead, I find it critical to monitor not only the most up-to-date data but also the changing economic policies around the world.\nEconomic Effects of Global Policy Changes\nTo pause briefly, I would like to take a moment to discuss the Fed's structure. The Fed operates independently from the elected government in Washington. We make our policies to best achieve the goals given to us by Congress of maximum employment and price stability. As such, it is not my role to comment on the policies offered by the U.S. government or any government around the world. Rather, I make assessments of the likely effects of these policies, observe the behavior of the U.S. and world economies, and develop views about the best U.S. monetary policy to achieve our dual-mandate goals.\nThe U.S. is implementing policy changes in trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation, and other economies are also changing their policies in the areas of trade and fiscal spending, particularly in defense, which could stimulate aggregate demand. But given that the most important changes have occurred so far in the area of trade policy, today I would like to discuss some important economic channels through which changes in tariffs may affect the U.S. economy.\nAlthough higher tariffs on U.S. imported goods may affect our macroeconomy through many channels, some of which I will describe next, I think they will primarily act as a negative supply shock, raising prices and decreasing economic activity. While uncertainty remains about the ultimate level of the average tariff rate, currently announced average tariffs in the U.S. are still much higher than they were in the past many decades. If tariffs remain significantly larger relative to earlier in the year, the same is likely to be true for the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.\nHow do I expect this to play out? In the near term, higher import costs will raise prices for both consumer goods and inputs to production. On their own, imported goods represent about 11 percent of U.S. GDP. However, given that several intermediate goods, such as aluminum and steel have been tariffed, and they affect costs in many sectors of the economy, prices of many goods and services are also likely to be affected. In addition, in conversations with business contacts, I have heard that firms are paying attention to the price sensitivity of consumers across the entire catalog of items sold and may spread price increases to less price-sensitive items to avoid reducing their profit margins. A Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas survey of Texas business executives found that 55 percent of respondents expect to pass through most or all of the costs from higher tariffs to customers.\n3\nOf those expecting to pass on costs, 26 percent expect to pass through the higher tariff cost upon the announcement of tariffs, and 64 percent expect this pass-through to occur within the first three months after the tariffs take effect. That would suggest that price increases may be observed soon.\nGiven these expected price increases, real incomes will fall, and operating costs will rise, which will lead consumers to demand fewer final goods and services and firms to demand fewer inputs. Ultimately, I see the U.S. as likely to experience lower growth and higher inflation. Over time, there could also be significant effects on productivity. As firms adjust to the higher input costs and lower demand, they may cut back on capital investment and shift to a less-efficient combination of inputs. Additionally, less-efficient domestic firms may increase their market share.\n4\nAll of this may result in a decrease in potential output growth, lowering the underlying pace of economic activity in the U.S.\nIn addition to any direct effect from actual global policy changes, consumers, businesses, and market participants have reported high levels of uncertainty about which policies may be ultimately chosen and how long they will remain in place. In fact, in recent months, several measures of economic uncertainty have risen sharply.\nThere are several types of measures that quantify economic uncertainty, with two types having gained prominence among economists closely monitoring the U.S. economic outlook.\n5\nSome are based on financial market transactions, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Volatility Index, popularly called the VIX. Others are based on the occurrence of certain keywords associated with the concept of uncertainty in newspapers of wide circulation, such as the economic policy uncertainty and trade policy uncertainty readings.\n6\nThese measures of uncertainty have reached historical highs in recent months. Similarly, I also saw the word \"uncertainty\" being highly cited in the Beige Book I reviewed before the FOMC's policy meeting last week.\n7\nIn times of heightened uncertainty, businesses may delay investment decisions, and consumers may increase precautionary savings and postpone discretionary purchases. Moreover, the economic research literature has documented that these decisions from businesses and consumers reverberate through the economy, pushing down aggregate demand. Firms, anticipating lower demand for their services and products, may post fewer job openings and cut back on investments to expand capacity. While the labor market has remained broadly resilient, the JOLTS data for March showed that job openings fell. Workers, therefore, may have a more difficult time finding employment, decreasing economy-wide income and aggregate demand.\n8\nThis lower aggregate demand may then exert downward pressure on inflation, though probably not by enough to offset the effect from the adverse supply shock that I previously mentioned. For example, recent data show that prices for accommodations and airfares have fallen, consistent with an increasing number of anecdotal reports of weaker consumer demand for discretionary travel services.\nI am also monitoring the effect of policy changes on another important channel: inflation expectations. For instance, consumers and businesses have reported tariffs as an important reason for having increased their near-term inflation expectations. Several surveys, including those from the Conference Board and the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and New York, have found that consumers and businesses expect higher inflation one year from now. Another closely watched survey from the University of Michigan showed that one-year-ahead inflation expectations in April were higher than in the pandemic period. This increase in short-run expectations may give businesses more leeway to raise prices.\nMost longer-run measures, including those from the Philadelphia Fed's Survey of Professional Forecasters and the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations, show either stability or much smaller increases in inflation expectations, which does provide some comfort to me. Additionally, inflation compensation, which is based on yields from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, has increased only for short-term maturities, such as one year ahead, and has shown stability in maturities over the five years starting five years from now. Still, I have taken note of the increase in longer-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey, which reached the highest level since June 1991. Given these developments, I am keeping a close watch on inflation, because as I have indicated in the past, I believe it is critical to keep long-term inflation expectations very well anchored at 2 percent.\nLooking globally, international developments do not seem to be adding inflationary pressures to the U.S. Economic growth in most develo",

Cook\nAt \"Finishing the Job and New Challenges,\"  a monetary policy conference hosted by the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Stanford, California\nShare\nGood afternoon. Thank you for moderating, Peter. It is an honor to be with you today, and it is always great to be back at Stanford and at the Hoover Institution. I spent several formative years of my career here, including as a National Fellow, and always enjoy returning. And it is a privilege to share the panel with Dr. Schnabel, and Presidents Musalem and Hammack. I look forward to our discussion.\n1\nBefore that, I would like to briefly discuss a topic I see as critical to the future path of the economy: productivity growth. Productivity growth has been surprisingly strong in recent years, and this has influenced my view of the appropriate stance of monetary policy. I will also explore two ongoing developments that are likely to influence productivity growth moving forward: changes to trade policy and the wider adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Productivity dynamics are something I have long studied closely and will continue to pay careful attention to as I consider the appropriate stance of monetary policy.\nIt is helpful to start by looking back about three years to the middle of 2022. At that point, the global economy had largely reopened after pandemic closures, a historic amount of federal support had been deployed, and unemployment was falling toward a half-century low. But supply disruptions persisted, and the 12-month inflation rate reached its peak at over 7 percent. The challenge for Federal Reserve policymakers was clear: Move inflation back toward its 2 percent target while maintaining the health of the labor market. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which I joined that year, began to raise the federal funds rate from near zero, ultimately reaching just above 5 percent by mid-2023. Many forecasters predicted that a recession in 2023 was more likely than not. And yet, one did not materialize. Instead, inflation came down considerably, while unemployment remained low. How did this unusual and welcome outcome happen?\nTwo notable factors were the unwinding of pandemic-era conditions that previously constrained the supply of both goods and labor in conjunction with restrictive monetary policy that contributed to a moderation in aggregate demand. Today, I would like to call attention to a third factor: a greater-than-usual increase in productivity during the pandemic recovery.\nPrior to the pandemic, from 2007 to 2019, productivity growth in the business sector averaged 1.5 percent annually. In the past five years productivity growth accelerated to 2 percent. While some of the productivity gains may reflect situations unique to the reopening of the economy, it is notable that the level of productivity, as measured by output per hour, remained above trend throughout 2023 and 2024.\n2\nThis increase in productivity was partially driven by pandemic labor shortages themselves. When it was difficult to find employees, as many Americans retired or stepped out of the labor force, many businesses innovated. For example, restaurants adopted online ordering apps and retailers accelerated the implementation of self-checkout systems.\n3\nThese changes improved efficiency and contributed to an expansion in potential gross domestic product (GDP). As a result, price pressures eased from their peak while demand remained strong.\nImproved productivity is widely beneficial to the economy. It allows workers to receive pay raises without companies needing to further increase prices and helps ensure consumers have access to the products and services they demand. Furthermore, and particularly relevant to me as a monetary policymaker, a rise in potential output lessens the need to use monetary policy to slow demand. This effect is good for the obvious reason that it allows for increasing economic growth without higher inflation. But importantly, it also lowers the risk of a policy overshoot that could cause the unemployment rate to rise.\nNow that I have reviewed the role that productivity growth played in the post-pandemic recovery, I would like to focus on two countervailing forces on productivity that I am currently studying. These are changes to trade policy and the growth of AI.\nI expect to see a drag on productivity in the near term stemming from the recent changes to trade policy and the related uncertainty, for several reasons. First, uncertainty around trade policy is likely to reduce business investment going forward. At this time, firms do not know the ultimate level and incidence of tariffs or their duration. Firms contemplating large investments might observe conditions that could hold under the paradox of thrift, wondering whether they could get a better deal if they just wait. Higher costs of imported materials and components could also cause firms to delay or scale back their investment plans. This reduction in capital formation can lead to slower technological innovation and adoption and decreased overall efficiency in production processes. Second, protectionist trade policies, while intended to support domestic industries, may inadvertently lead to a less competitive environment, if they prop up less efficient firms. And third, any supply-chain disruptions resulting from the policy changes would make production slower and less efficient. These disruptions can lead to inventory mismatches, production delays, and increased costs as firms scramble to find alternative suppliers or redesign their products to accommodate new input constraints. This set of disruptions could pose a particular challenge for monetary policymakers. A reduction in potential GDP means less slack in the economy, which, in turn, means greater inflationary pressure. According to the Taylor Principle, for which no explanation is needed at this conference, taming higher inflation requires a higher policy rate. I believe that keeping inflation expectations credibly anchored is essential. Therefore, all else equal, lower productivity could cause me to support keeping rates at a higher level for longer.\nThe second ongoing economic development I see altering productivity is the rapidly expanding use of AI. I view this emerging technology as likely to have a significant positive effect on productivity growth. In fact, I see AI as poised to be at least as transformative as other general purpose technologies, such as the printing press, the steam engine, and the internet. With wider adoption of AI, we could have a surge in potential output.\nAs I have discussed in several recent speeches, AI has the potential to revolutionize numerous sectors of our economy.\n4\nWe already see AI assistants boosting productivity in customer service, software development, and medical diagnosis. AI's ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data could lead to breakthroughs in scientific research and innovation, resulting in an increased arrival rate of new ideas, further amplifying its effect on productivity.\nOf course, an AI productivity boom would come with its own set of challenges. If potential output expands too rapidly, it could leave slack in the economy and the labor market. Moreover, the productivity gains from AI may not be uniform across all sectors, job types, or tasks, leading to a transitional period as the labor market adjusts. Despite these challenges, I am optimistic about AI and its potential to drive significant productivity growth in the coming years.\nTo summarize, I see an important role for productivity growth to play in assisting FOMC policymakers to achieve our dual-mandate goals. This dynamic played out, alongside other factors, in recent years when inflation eased from historic highs while the labor market remained solid. Two currently unfolding economic events are likely to influence productivity growth in the coming years\u00e2\u0080\u0094specifically, changes to trade policy and the expansion of AI. Those two developments may prove to run counter to each other, but it is too soon to predict precisely. I will be closely monitoring developments in this space. I look forward to engaging with those studying this topic including, I am sure, many in this room.\nThank you. I look forward to the discussion.\n1.

Waller\nAt the \"John Taylor and Taylor Rules in Policy\" Hoover Monetary Policy Conference: Finishing the Job and New Challenges, The Hoover Institution, Stanford, California\nShare\nThank you, Volker, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nJohn Taylor is deservedly well known for his work on monetary policy rules, the best known of which bear his name. But in the early 1980s, John was part of a broader discussion about rules versus discretion in the setting of monetary policy.\nThe traditional argument for discretionary monetary policy was that any policy choice that a rule would recommend could be replicated by discretion, especially when policymakers are aware of the rule, but not vice versa. Discretion allowed more flexibility than a rule and thus was the dominant strategy for setting monetary policy.\nThen, in 1977, Finn Kydland and Ed Prescott published their paper \"Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans,\" which argued that policy promises made today may not be carried out in the future if there are advantages to reneging on those promises.\n2\nReneging on promises made by discretionary policymakers, they argued, is much easier than reneging on a policy rule, which is a way to commit to future actions.\nKydland and Prescott provided a simple and appealing model at the end of their paper. The model had an incentive for the central bank to renege on its promise to keep inflation low, since doing so would expand the economy and lower unemployment. If rational agents knew of this incentive, they would not find the promise of low inflation credible and would therefore raise their expectations for future inflation. The central bank would then have to validate those expectations with higher inflation to avoid a recession. In the end, the economy ends up in a high-inflation equilibrium with no gains from higher output or lower unemployment.\nKydland and Prescott then showed that if, on the other hand, the central bank could commit to following a rule to set policy, then it could not renege on its promises. As a result, inflation would stay low while yielding the same outcomes for output and employment. In this case, rules beat discretion. This was pathbreaking research, and it came to influence both the theory and practice of central banking. It was also part of the basis for Kydland and Prescott's Nobel Prize in Economics in 2004.\nBut commitment to most things in life is easier said than done. Even rules can be abandoned if it is optimal to do so. In the absence of commitment, can the central bank do anything to enhance the credibility of its promise to keep inflation low?\nIn 1983, Robert Barro and David Gordon used the Kydland\u00e2\u0080\u0093Prescott example to study reputation building by the central bank.\n3\nThe basic idea is to establish a reputation for fulfilling promises. But what promises can be made in a discretionary world that the public would find credible? They showed that promising the low-inflation outcome wasn't credible. However, the central bank could promise an inflation rate that was between the low-inflation equilibrium and the high-inflation equilibrium. If private individuals expected this intermediate inflation rate, then the gains from reneging would be reduced just enough to dissuade the central bank from breaking its promise. Consequently, promises to deliver this intermediate inflation rate were credible, and society was better off than it would be in the high-inflation world, showing that credibility really mattered in a world in which commitment was not feasible.\nI now introduce John Taylor and his work into the story, which coincided with the beginning of my own research career.\nIn 1983, having read the Barro and Gordon paper, I started working on reputation-building strategies as part of my Ph.D. dissertation research. In the process, I was struck by the thought that the building of credibility and reputation hinges on the person setting monetary policy at the time: If that person leaves, does the central bank have to start over to rebuild its credibility? At the time, I had in mind Paul Volcker, whose personal credibility seemed so crucial in the Federal Reserve's campaign to vanquish high inflation. Relying on the credibility of individual policymakers seemed like a weak foundation for sustaining the credibility of policy promises.\nThat is when I went back and read John Taylor's discussion of the Barro and Gordon paper in the\nJournal of Monetary Economics\n.\n4\nJohn applauded the analytical contribution that Barro and Gordon\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as Kydland and Prescott\u00e2\u0080\u0094had made, but he was skeptical about the practical applicability of their story. In his critique, John said, \"In other well-recognized time inconsistency situations, society seems to have found ways to institute the optimal (cooperative) policy.\"\n5\nAs I read that sentence, I thought, \"How does society build credibility into the institution instead of relying on the credibility of an individual?\" That one sentence that John wrote in 1983 set me off on a 20-year journey studying central bank design.\nSo where did it lead me?\nAround that time, Ken Rogoff published his paper on what he referred to as \"conservative\" central bankers.\n6\nIn his terminology, a conservative central banker was someone who disliked inflation more than the rest of society did. Rogoff showed that a conservative central banker would choose a lower rate of inflation than the average citizen but at the cost of greater instability of output and employment. This tradeoff improved social well-being, but there was one catch to this solution\u00e2\u0080\u0094there had to be safeguards to guarantee that the conservative central banker could not be fired for this policy decision, ensuring that these promises to control inflation were credible. In short, the central bank had to be independent and protected from the threats to its independence.\nThis type of institutional design issue was one that I was interested in researching.\nUp until Rogoff's work, the underlying assumption had been that the central bank was trying to maximize social welfare and that its preferences were aligned with those of society. Think of it as a \"representative agent\" economy. But as I read Rogoff's work, it suggested that society consisted of people who had a variety of views about inflation, meaning that they would also have different views on the tradeoff between inflation and output stability. Consequently, members of society may have different views on how conservative the central banker should be. But where are these views coming from?\nSo I tried to endogenize the heterogeneity in preferences. I had the idea that individuals all had the same fundamental preferences for inflation and output stability but that they varied if they worked in different sectors of the economy. In one sector, wages and employment were determined in a standard competitive fashion. In the other sector, wages were determined by wage contracts, and employment was determined by demand. Thus, when a negative shock hit the economy, the wage contract workers suffered a bigger reduction in employment because wages couldn't adjust, whereas in the competitive sector, wages would adjust to soften the blow to employment\u00e2\u0080\u0094implying that if the wage contract sector got to choose a conservative central banker, they would want a more dovish central banker who would accept higher inflation in return for greater employment stability. The flexible wage workers wanted the opposite: They were more hawkish on inflation because they didn't bear the same employment volatility. The punchline was that if political parties formed around workers from different sectors, then they would install central bankers with different policy preferences if they won the election.\nIt was around that time that I read Alberto Alesina's paper on \"partisan business cycles.\"\n7\nIn that paper, he assumed there were different political parties, each having different preferences about inflation and unemployment. One party was more concerned with price stability and less concerned about output stability than the other. Monetary policy and inflation outcomes were determined by the party that won a national election. As power changed hands after an election, monetary policy would differ from expected policy depending on who won the election. These election surprises would create volatility in monetary policy and thus inflation and output. In other words, elections would lead to partisan business cycles. In Alesina's model, monetary policy was fully accountable to the electorate, which is desirable, but it came at the cost of causing greater economic instability.\nThis was a brilliant paper, but, again, it raised a serious question for me: Why would society choose full electoral accountability and maximum volatility in monetary policy? Economists usually think there are tradeoffs on the margin such that \"corner solutions\" like these aren't optimal. It seemed to me that there could be a welfare-improving institutional design for the central bank. I looked at the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors structure, and I felt that electoral accountability could be achieved through the appointment process, but economic instability would be reduced by having a monetary policy board composed of current and past appointees who set policy according to majority rule. This thinking led me to taking a variant of Alesina's model and studying how a policy board would change his results.\nI assumed that board members were appointed by the winning party of an election to serve for multiple periods. This appointment process provided accountability to the electorate via the nomination and confirmation process. To ensure that economic stability would be improved, I assumed these members served staggered and long (relative to the election cycle) terms in office.\n8\nFurthermore, as in Rogoff's model, board members could not be removed from office. This feature of the model captured the idea that the central bank board would be independent.\nMy research showed that by having an independent policy board set monetary policy, social well-being was improved relative to Alesina's results. Accountability to the electorate could be achieved through the nomination and confirmation process, and economic stability was enhanced by having a group of individuals set policy who could not be removed from office. This structure is the one that we have in place today at the Federal Reserve. I would argue that it has stood the test of time, and I hope that it continues to be in place for years to come.\nTo conclude, I have come full circle in my professional life\u00e2\u0080\u0094from first reading that sentence that John wrote in 1983 to researching central bank independence and central bank boards for 20 years to then becoming a central bank board member, which led me here today. So, I can finally thank John for sending me on a wonderful journey that he had no idea he launched me on.\n1.

Kugler\nAt the Reykjav\u00c3\u00adk Economic Conference 2025, Central Bank of Iceland, Reykjav\u00c3\u00adk, Iceland\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Francine, and thank you to the Central Bank of Iceland for the invitation to speak to you today.\n1\nMy subject is the Federal Reserve's mandate of maximum employment. In the Fed's monetary policymaking, maximum employment and stable prices are linked in the mandate assigned to the Federal Reserve by U.S. law, which we refer to as the dual mandate. Icelanders, I know, are a seafaring people, and those here will understand what I mean when I say that the dual mandate is our \"lodestar,\" a word our two languages share. It is our goal and our guide in setting monetary policy.\nThere is an important distinction between our dual-mandate goals. For reasons that I will explain, while the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has defined \"stable prices\" as 2 percent annual inflation, such numerical precision is not possible in defining maximum employment.\nTo achieve price stability, the Fed adopted a numerical target for inflation in 2012 that hasn't changed. It has remained unchanged because the Committee has repeatedly reaffirmed the judgment that it made in 2012 that 2 percent inflation is the rate most consistent with its statutory mandate. In contrast, the Federal Reserve has not spelled out a numerical goal for the unemployment rate or some other measure of employment because maximum employment can move up and down over time and is not directly measurable, and also because the different factors that determine it are either difficult or impossible to measure in real time.\nPlan of the Talk\nThe unemployment rate is the statistic that the public most often uses to form views about labor market conditions, and it is also the statistic that economists most often use to try to infer maximum employment. And economists frequently refer to u* as the unemployment rate that corresponds to maximum employment. That said, in my speech today, I would like to offer historical examples of why u* varies over time and why it would be a mistake to assume that it is a fixed number.\n2\nThen, I will review the evolution of the unemployment rate over the past two decades and show that this rate has varied over time, moved by the interplay of myriad factors such as demographics, labor market regulations, changes in business or consumer confidence, or cyclical changes in aggregate demand and monetary policy shocks. In contrast, u* is moved mostly by either structural changes, such as skill deterioration or capital depreciation, or by long-run factors in the labor market, such as the demographic and skill composition of the population. As a result, u* does not move as much as the unemployment rate over time.\n3\nThis is significant because monetary policy is aimed at managing the business cycle to minimize deviations from maximum employment.\nIn reviewing the unemployment rate, I will also note that it certainly bears valuable information, but, in many cases, this needs to be complemented with other labor market indicators to have a fuller picture of the state of the economy.\nAs I have noted, maximum employment is not directly measurable. Likewise, we cannot observe u* directly, and it has to be inferred by statistical techniques, which I'll review.\n4\nOne element common to all the approaches that I review is that they use a number of labor market indicators in addition to the unemployment rate in forming their estimates of maximum employment. Another element in common to some of the approaches is that they try to separate transient factors, or higher-frequency variation, from a more permanent, long-run feature of the economy that can be interpreted as u*.\nCase Study: The Assumption of a Fixed Maximum Employment in the 1970s\nA common assumption in the economics profession during the 1960s was that u* was 4 percent.\n5\nWhile this number might have been a decent approximation of u* during that period, it did not consider the possibility of meaningful changes in that value and, specifically, changes due to the rapid growth in labor supply from the post\u00e2\u0080\u0093World War II baby boomers entering the workforce. Especially because younger workers have higher levels of unemployment, the advent of the baby boomers meant that u* in the 1970s was surely higher than 4 percent. The Federal Reserve was slow in revising its estimate of u*. The high unemployment rate and too low fixed estimate of u* minimum unemployment, in conjunction with the failure to recognize the slowdown in trend productivity, led the Federal Reserve to exaggerate the estimate of slack in the economy and maintain monetary policy that was too loose, adding to other factors driving persistently high inflation over that decade.\n6\nThis experience led the Federal Reserve to recognize that a fixed 4 percent value for u* was a poor basis for understanding the cyclical position of the economy.\nThe experience of the 1960s and 1970s made it clear that demographic changes need to be considered in estimating u*\u00e2\u0080\u0094a topic I will explore further in my speech.\nThe U.S. Labor Market over the Past Two Decades\nThe U.S. labor market over the past two decades provides some valuable circumstantial evidence for how maximum employment can change over time. Let me start by discussing the Great Recession, which began in late 2007 and was driven by a severe financial crisis. In the months before the recession began, the unemployment rate reached a low of 4.4 percent and then peaked at 10 percent in October 2009. Although the unemployment rate is a useful metric of the severity of that event, an additional variable that reflects the depth and persistence of the downturn in the labor market after the Great Recession was the share of long-term unemployed\u00e2\u0080\u0094the percentage of unemployed people out of work for 27 weeks or more\u00e2\u0080\u0094which was nearly twice as high as during the deep recession of the 1980s. Longer spells of unemployment can generate persistence because the longer the duration of unemployment for workers, the more their skills erode and the harder it is to become reemployed, leading, in turn, to higher unemployment, a phenomenon known as hysteresis. While some have argued that only workers unemployed for shorter durations should be counted in estimating the slack in the economy, hysteresis is an important part of slack during periods with high unemployment.\n7\nInstead, the experience of the Great Recession reinforced the value of consulting other useful measures of slack.\nAfter the Great Recession, it took eight years for the unemployment rate to reach the pre-recession low, but when it did, in 2016, it continued to fall, reaching 3.5 percent in 2019 and remaining close to this level until the beginning of the COVID-19 recession in 2020. One thing that was remarkable about this period was that this low level of unemployment occurred without any escalation of inflation. Personal consumption expenditures inflation ran well below an annual rate of 2 percent for almost all of the decade after the Great Recession, when monetary policy was highly accommodative. One could infer that u* had moved down over this period.\nTurning to the pandemic recession, the unemployment rate rose to nearly 15 percent in two months, but a distinguishing feature of this increase was that a large fraction of the unemployed were temporarily laid off.\n8\nEconomic research suggests that those who lose their jobs via temporary layoffs have a high likelihood of being recalled, with the latest estimates suggesting a 60 percent probability.\n9\nConsidering this, it was not surprising that the post-pandemic recovery was characterized by a fast decline in the unemployment rate.\n10\nIn this sense, the unemployment rate alone was not a sufficient indicator of the true state of the labor market. In the post-pandemic recovery, the unemployment rate fell to 3.4 percent by April 2023. Again, for a second time we saw the unemployment rate falling to levels that were in the past associated with price pressures, whereas in this case inflation was also falling.\nIn summary, the past two recessions underscored that there are useful statistics beyond the unemployment rate that help inform a reading of maximum employment, and the past two recoveries suggest that the U.S. economy may sustain unemployment as low as 3.5 percent.\nTurning to the current state of the labor market, the unemployment rate has risen only very slowly, and it has moved within a tight range of around 4.2 percent, which is its current reading. In addition, temporary layoffs are back at their pre-pandemic level, and vacancies and quits have leveled off. As a consequence, I judge the labor market to be stable. Most likely, the labor market is also close to maximum employment given that the estimates of u* from some of the models that I will consider in the rest of this speech are in the vicinity of 4.2 percent.\nI have used some historical examples to illustrate how the unemployment rate has changed over time, and I have made some informal inference on the movements of u* in certain periods. Now let me explore different ways of estimating maximum employment. I will cover three separate methods: a method that uses the demographic composition of the population; a definition that considers the unemployment rate in conjunction with inflation in order to get closer to a definition of u* consistent with stable prices; and, lastly, a definition that focuses on maximum employment that one can obtain by taking into account that workers take time to find jobs and firms take time to fill job openings. Some of the models that I review also consider the labor force participation rate, as structural variation in this rate also affects maximum employment. Historical experience with the different forces that can move around maximum employment indicates that all three of these approaches could be helpful in the future when trying to estimate maximum employment.\n11\nEstimation of Maximum Employment Using Demographics\nIn describing the impact of the baby boomers on the labor market, I have already provided an example of how the demographic composition of the workforce may affect maximum employment. More generally, the age distribution in the population or educational attainment or skill distribution are always important factors in evaluating the potential workforce. Beyond the composition of the workforce, developments within specific demographic subgroups also may be relevant for maximum employment. For instance, the increase in labor force participation of women over the past 50 years has been an important factor that has augmented the available workforce. Granular data from the Labor Department's monthly survey of household employment known as the Current Population Survey, sometimes in conjunction with data on job openings and flows in and out of employment, can add demographic details to the estimation of maximum employment.\nThe models that exploit demographic data separate the trend or structural factors in both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate from transient factors in individual demographic groups, allowing an estimate of maximum employment.\n12\nI think of this as a \"bottom up\" approach.\n13\nOne can add an additional layer of complexity in working with demographic groups. One important aspect of the unemployment rate is its characteristic countercyclical dynamics\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, the way this rate increases at the onset of recessions due to an increase in the flow out of employment or layoffs, and its decline in expansions as more unemployed workers find jobs and flow into employment. In recognition of the importance of these flows, one alternative to extracting trends by demographic group is to extract trends in the flows by demographic groups and reconstruct u* dynamics from those flows. The implicit assumption is that the trend components of flows into and out of unemployment capture structural characteristics of the labor market, including market imperfections and the cost of job searches for both workers and employers.\n14\nThe models in this class estimate a trend unemployment rate in the range between 4.1 and 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n15\nEstimation of Maximum Employment Consistent with Stable Prices\nAs I mentioned, the dual mandate includes stable prices. The models that I have just described do not contain information on prices. However, one may include price information by adding inflation as a measure of aggregate price pressures in order to come up with an estimate of maximum employment consistent with stable prices.\n16\nA higher unemployment rate signals more workers are available to work, indicating more slack. As more workers are employed, the economy is moving to a situation of fewer resources being available for additional output and most likely to more price pressures. Maximum employment consistent with stable prices ideally strikes a balance between additional workers being hired and additional increases in prices. I have alluded to this concept in an informal way when arguing that in the period after the Great Recession, u* may have moved down through 2019.\nIn practice, inflation information is folded into the model by adding a relationship between prices and the unemployment rate known as the Philips curve. There is a long tradition in extracting trend employment consistent with stable prices using a various labor market and output measures. I will draw upon that heritage and briefly describe a model that like the statistical methods that I have already reviewed also aims at estimating maximum employment by separating the unemployment rate from cyclical factors, but it does so by using numerous output and labor market indicators in conjunction with price information.\n17\nOutput indicators include both gross domestic product and gross domestic income. Among labor market indicators, in addition to the unemployment rate, there are payrolls, the workweek, and labor force participation, which means that the model is not limited to just the unemployment rate in inferring trend unemployment. The purpose of using many indicators is the belief that all of them follow the same cycle, and that it is easier to identify and separate the cycle from trend using a large set of indicators. Coming back to the Phillips curve, I would note that models that estimate u* are somewhat sensitive to the specification of the Phillips curve. For instance, the model that I have just described has a u* estimate of about 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024, but alternative Phillips curve specifications may lower it below 5 percent.\n18\nEstimation of the Efficient Level of Employment\nA third, often less mentioned concept of full employment is the \"efficient\" leve",

Barr\nAt the Reykjav\u00c3\u00adk Economic Conference 2025, Central Bank of Iceland, Reykjav\u00c3\u00adk, Iceland\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nIn my remarks, I would like to address a key question facing economists, policymakers, and people all over the world: How will artificial intelligence, particularly generative artificial intelligence, or GenAI, affect workers and the labor market in the years ahead?\nBefore I turn to that issue, I'd like to touch on a topic that I expect is also of interest: the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy.\nThe U.S. economy entered this quarter in a relatively strong position: The unemployment rate has been low and stable, and the disinflationary process has continued on a gradual, albeit uneven, path towards our 2 percent objective. Private domestic final purchases have been solid. Overall, the economy has been resilient.\nAgainst that backdrop, the outlook has been clouded by trade policies that have led to an increase in uncertainty, contributing to declines in measures of consumer and business sentiment. I expect tariffs to lead to higher inflation in the United States and lower growth both in the United States and abroad starting later this year.\nIn my view, higher tariffs could lead to disruption to global supply chains and create persistent upward pressure on inflation. Faced with substantial tariffs, businesses will likely change how they source intermediate inputs, and it will take time and investment for them to reroute their distribution networks. Conversely, global trade networks may change rapidly, and some suppliers may not be able to adapt quickly enough to survive these changes. This concern is particularly acute for small businesses, which are less diversified, less able to access credit, and hence more vulnerable to adverse shocks. Small businesses play a vital role in production networks, often providing specialized inputs that can't easily be sourced elsewhere, and business failures could further disrupt supply chains. As we saw during the pandemic, such disruptions can have large and lasting effects on prices, as well as output.\nI am equally concerned that tariffs will lead to higher unemployment as the economy slows. Thus, the FOMC may be in a difficult position if we were to see both rising inflation and rising unemployment.\nThe size and scope of the recent tariff increases are without modern precedent, we don't know their final form, and it is too soon to know how they will affect the economy. Yet given the economy's strong starting point and the progress we have made in bringing inflation back toward our 2 percent objective, monetary policy is in a good position to adjust as conditions unfold. Meanwhile, we will also be closely monitoring how technologies like artificial intelligence are being integrated into economic activity and analyzing the implications for how the economy will evolve.\nLet me now return to the longer-term question of how AI will affect the labor market. Debate about machines replacing workers is nothing new, and even artificial intelligence is not particularly new either. AI has, in some form, arguably been around for decades. Computer scientists have been developing machine learning algorithms for many years, and these algorithms have been widely used in commercial applications, such as fraud detection and advertising. Speech and facial recognition are already ubiquitous. These more long-standing forms of AI are continuing to improve, driving progress in domains ranging from finance to medical diagnosis, and becoming so deeply embedded in our daily lives that we scarcely notice them anymore.\nBut GenAI promises to go much further. Unlike traditional machine learning techniques, which often focus on relatively simple prediction and classification tasks, the large language models that have emerged in recent years can generate new content\u00e2\u0080\u0094anything from news articles to computer code to images and video to customer service dialogue. Emerging forms of \"agentic\" AI can undertake complex, multistep tasks\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, taking a customer through a transaction and then placing an automated order. As AI continues to develop, it will increasingly be combined with physical technologies like autonomous vehicles and advanced robotics, further extending its ability to interact with the real world. And AI may be shaping up to become what the esteemed economist Zvi Griliches called an \"invention of a method of inventing\" that speeds up the research and development process itself.\n2\nGrowing evidence indicates that AI will be a \"general purpose technology\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as railroads, electricity, or computers\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is characterized by widespread adoption, complementary progress in many downstream applications, and ongoing improvement in the core technology.\n3\nPast general purpose technologies have dramatically improved productivity. So, against this background, the natural question is, what about AI?\nIn trying to understand how AI might transform work, it's useful to consider how it could be applied in individual occupations, each of which comprises a range of tasks that vary in their susceptibility to automation. Like past waves of information technology, AI will substitute for human labor in some tasks, complement human labor in other tasks, and spur the creation of new tasks that humans will perform, at least initially.\n4\nThe net effects of AI on employment, both in the aggregate and across demographic and education groups, will depend on the relative size of these offsetting effects.\nA pessimistic view is that AI and robotics could become so capable and cost effective as to render most human labor obsolete, culminating in mass unemployment. Such concerns about technological advances are hardly a novel development. At least since the Luddites of the early 19th century tried to disable textile looms, people have feared that machines would bring about steep declines in employment, wages, and human welfare.\n5\nEconomists have long been skeptical of that view, which suffers from the \"lump of labor fallacy\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094the presumption that there's a fixed amount of work to be done, so if machines do it, humans will not.\n6\nNew technologies do eliminate some existing occupations, and not all workers benefit from technological change. But technology also creates new occupations, and the many waves of technological advances over the centuries haven't rendered humans obsolete. For example, many of the tasks that were performed by humans in the 1950s are now performed by computers and robots, and yet the unemployment rate is similar to what it was back then, while the labor force participation rate is higher overall.\nHowever, the amazing potential capabilities and breadth of applications associated with AI\u00e2\u0080\u0094many of which are already apparent\u00e2\u0080\u0094make it worth asking whether this time may be different. AI holds enormous promise of faster economic growth, advances in human health, and a higher standard of living. But alongside the kinds of labor market disruptions seen in past episodes of revolutionary technological change, we will need to consider the possibility of more sweeping changes in the way we work.\nA Scenario Approach\nIn a previous speech, I outlined two hypothetical scenarios describing how AI could evolve.\n7\nIn the first scenario, we see only incremental adoption that primarily augments what humans do today but still leads to significant and widespread productivity gains. In the second scenario, we see profound change, in which we extend human capabilities with far-reaching consequences.\nToday, I will apply the same approach to analyze the potential effects of AI on the labor market. Of course, there is tremendous uncertainty about how AI will evolve and how it will affect the economy, as well as society more broadly. Amid this uncertainty, a scenario-based approach can give us a framework for thinking about the potential effects of AI on employment, real wages, and productivity, as well as for considering the possible role that government could play in influencing this transition.\nScenario 1: Incremental Progress\nLet's start with the \"gradual\" scenario, in which new AI technologies are adopted at a brisk, but not a breathless, pace or advance quickly at first and then plateau\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps because of constraints imposed by computing resources, the exhaustion of novel training data, and rising energy consumption.\nUnder this scenario, AI primarily operates by automating some\u00e2\u0080\u0094but not all\u00e2\u0080\u0094tasks within many occupations. We've seen some of this task substitution happen already: Computer programmers rely on AI copilots to write code, allowing them to focus on higher-level tasks, while customer support agents can use chatbots to improve and expedite their responses.\n8\nLawyers draw on GenAI to conduct legal research, while AI-powered safety features improve the performance of human automobile drivers.\nUnder this scenario, as foundational models improve, novel use cases are discovered, and businesses continue to integrate AI into their operations, more and more occupations will be affected, and many jobs will use AI tools more intensively. As these technologies improve, even incremental change may allow AI to become accurate and cheap enough to replace some occupations altogether. It's hard to make predictions at this stage. But a plausible conjecture is that we could see, for example, fewer human programmers, lawyers, or commercial drivers. At the same time, most current occupations would persist in this scenario\u00e2\u0080\u0094albeit in modified and more productive forms.\nBeyond existing occupations, general purpose technologies also encourage the creation of new occupations, fueled by new products and novel ways of doing business. It's difficult to envision the novel jobs that will replace the ones we might lose to an incremental AI scenario. But one possibility is that the future could bring us managers of AI agents, specialists in human\u00e2\u0080\u0093AI collaboration, ethicists, safety experts, and large numbers of people involved in adopting, maintaining, and educating about AI tools. Technology, and how we use a particular innovation, evolves in unpredictable ways, and we should expect to be surprised.\nUnder this scenario, jobs remain plentiful, real wages are buoyed by productivity gains, and employment and labor force participation remain high and could even rise, if strong wage growth entices new labor market entrants and if improvements in health care increase work capacity among older or disabled individuals. If the widespread adoption of AI proceeds gradually, then workers will have time to adjust, reducing the disruption to the labor market\u00e2\u0080\u0094though, as with previous general purpose technologies, AI would likely imply that some groups of workers experience a painful process of dislocation and transition.\nRetraining could help here. A recent survey carried out by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that many businesses plan to retrain their workers to use AI rather than laying them off.\n9\nIn some cases, AI may disrupt career ladders by automating many entry-level tasks\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as reviewing legal documents or drafting code\u00e2\u0080\u0094that were historically performed by early-career workers. But if labor demand changes slowly enough, students and workers are more likely to have time to predict which skills will be marketable and to make and recoup human capital investments before their skills become obsolete.\nWhat about the effect of AI on inequality? Some research suggests that GenAI may help less-productive workers catch up to their more-productive peers.\n10\nThat said, the AI economy will likely put a premium on digital skills, facility with new technologies, and adaptability. The precedent of the computer revolution suggests that highly educated workers may benefit most, boosting wage inequality\u00e2\u0080\u0094a phenomenon called \"skill-biased technological change.\"\n11\nAnother possibility is that the labor share of income could decline, if capital owners benefit more than wage earners\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, because the gains accruing from AI adoption go to large, highly capitalized firms whose technical capabilities, consumer networks, and training data allow them to develop state-of-the-art AI techniques.\nScenario 2: Transformation\nNow let's consider an alternative scenario in which AI completely transforms the economy. As I described in my earlier speech, in this transformative scenario, humans employ AI to unleash their imagination and creativity\u00e2\u0080\u0094combined with robust investment in research and development\u00e2\u0080\u0094to make rapid breakthroughs that have the potential to improve our lives. With growth propelled by swift technological progress, society's resources would be vastly expanded, AI would spur revolutionary advances in health, and many individuals would enjoy more time for leisure activities.\nIndeed, transformative AI could bring about a state of affairs that John Maynard Keynes famously envisioned almost a hundred years ago, one in which there are \"ever larger and larger classes and groups of people from whom problems of economic necessity have been practically removed.\"\n12\nAt the same time, transformative AI could imply a much smaller role for human labor\u00e2\u0080\u0094a development that would entail sweeping social changes and profound challenges for government.\nUnder this scenario, AI would take over a broad range of existing jobs. As economist Anton Korinek writes, \"AI systems advance toward mastering all forms of cognitive work that can be performed by humans, including new tasks that don't even exist yet.\"\n13\nBuilding on developments we are already starting to see, improved chatbots and AI agents would outperform their human counterparts in activities ranging from customer support to medical diagnosis. Along similar lines, advanced robotics could increasingly substitute for human workers in manual and production jobs. Widespread automation would bring many benefits. The availability and quality of many services could increase markedly, and many less-desirable jobs\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as those involving tedious tasks or dangerous working conditions\u00e2\u0080\u0094could be transferred to machines.\nWhat jobs\nwould\nexist in this more transformative scenario? As in the more gradual scenario\u00e2\u0080\u0094and just as has happened in the past, when earlier general purpose technologies were adopted\u00e2\u0080\u0094we would see the emergence of new occupations. These would notably include jobs that involve managing the new AI-dominated economy. In addition, some existing occupations would likely persist, at least for some time. This would be the case for three key reasons. First, some jobs may prove especially hard to automate. For example, plumbers and mech",

Cook\nAt the James Madison College 2025 Spring Commencement, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan\nShare\nWatch Live\nHuge congratulations to Michigan State University's James Madison College Class of 2025!\n1\nIt is an honor to speak to this inspiring and talented graduating class. Before I address the graduates, I would like to thank those who helped you get here: the parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles, friends, teachers, and mentors. Congratulations and thank you to all who lifted up the Class of 2025.\nAs a professor's kid and as an MSU professor, I have come to treasure commencements as important milestones. It is wonderful to be with you today. The flowers are starting to bloom in Beal Garden, the lawns around Beaumont Tower are turning the perfect shade of Spartan green, and the ducklings are making their appearance on the Red Cedar. After another chilly winter, campus is reaching peak beauty\u00e2\u0080\u0094just in time for you to leave Michigan State.\nI am full of optimism about everything that lies ahead of you. Despite any sense of angst you may feel about moving on from Madison, I hope that you are filled with optimism, too. Spring is a time of new beginnings. You are ready for the next step. Today marks both the completion of a tremendous accomplishment, and an exciting new beginning. Some of you may be feeling uncertain. That is natural. Others of you may have detailed plans that you are ready to execute. Remember, if you keep your head down and your eyes fixed only on the map, you may miss unexpected opportunities. Life\u00e2\u0080\u0094like Michigan weather\u00e2\u0080\u0094is going to surprise you. As you leave here, I want you to remain optimistic and have confidence, because you are ready.\nWhen I was in your shoes, graduating from Spelman College, I remember feeling unsure of what the world would have in store for me. I did not imagine I would be a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, or even an economist. (I started Spelman as a physics and philosophy major.) I only came to see economics as a potential route several years after my graduation, following a chance encounter. At the time, I was continuing my studies in philosophy in Senegal and was struggling to find the right prism through which to explore big questions that interested and motivated me. I decided to set out for an adventure of a lifetime: hike Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. As luck would have it, during that journey I met a British economist. By the end of the trek, he convinced me that economics held the tools to address the questions I cared about deeply. Within months, I moved back home, enrolled in classes to prepare for a Ph.D. in economics, and began a path that ultimately led me to both Michigan State and the Federal Reserve.\nToday, you are leaving the safe harbor of Case Hall and East Lansing, ready to depart on your next adventure. As you do, I would like to offer four guides for you to navigate your journey ahead: hope, curiosity, persistence, and a commitment to public service.\nHope\nMy first guide for you is hope. Hope is a value instilled in me from a very young age. I saw my parents and family members face difficult challenges. They persevered because they held out hope that their actions would lead to a better future, not only for themselves, but for me and my sisters, our community, and ultimately all of society. I am proud to have followed in their footsteps.\nAs James Madison graduates, I know each of you has some corner of the world in which you have made a difference or wish to make a difference. It could have been through debate, JMC Senate, ASMSU, 4-H, ROTC, peer mentoring, Fed Challenge, a public service sorority or fraternity, or Model UN, among many other organizations. Whatever issue interests you, to make progress, you must undertake the difficult work of casting off old ways that no longer serve us, and adopting new ideas, new methods, and new technologies. This process requires faith put into action. Optimism expressed through effort. The daily choice to believe that you can make a difference. So, as you proceed, when you feel unsure, I urge you to guard your sense of hope. Let hope guide you to a better future.\nCuriosity\nMy next guide for you is curiosity. I encourage you to remain curious, for your attention and your time are among your most precious resources. From your first-year seminar, through your methods courses, to your senior seminars, your studies honed your capacity to seek new insights. I urge you to ask questions, hunt for the best available information, reason through it, and listen carefully to other points of view.\nRemain curious about what others can teach you, and do not settle for easy answers. It is imperative that you continue to be filled with wonder about the world so that you can make it better. Curiosity is magical, but it takes vigilance, practice, and study to avoid stagnation, and to reach new insights. Curiosity will lead you to wonderful opportunities if you trust its guidance.\nPersistence\nThat leads me to my third suggestion for your journey ahead: be persistent. As Madison graduates, you know about preparation. To be persistent in your efforts, you need to continually prepare yourself for the next steps, even if you do not know the destination. It means grounding what you think and say in deep and informed knowledge, acquired through effort and reflection.\nYou are graduating at a unique time in the history of the world. We have access to unprecedented quantities of data. We have tools to gather and analyze these data to understand and improve the world. I encourage you to view learning as a lifelong pursuit. I ask you to familiarize yourself with new technologies and tools, such as artificial intelligence, and incorporate them into persistent preparation as a companion, not as a substitute, to live an informed, productive, and fulfilling life.\nService\nMy final guide for you is a call to service. I know you understand this as James Madison students. Public service is woven into the culture here. Historically, Madison graduates have entered public service jobs immediately after graduation in large numbers, including with the Peace Corps, Teach for America, nonprofits, and local, state, and federal agencies.\nOver the course of my life, many of my proudest and most enriching memories were opportunities to serve. (Were any of you in 4-H like I was? Do you remember the pledge? It is \"Head, Heart, Hands, and Health.\") Whether it was my time as a page in the Georgia legislature, interning on Capitol Hill, serving on the Executive Committee of the American Economic Association (AEA), working at the U.S. Treasury and the White House, leading the AEA Summer Program at MSU, or now, as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, these opportunities to use my knowledge, skills, and time to try to improve the world have been invaluable to me.\nAs proud James Madison graduates, look for different opportunities to serve the greater good over the course of your lives. Public service is not always easy, but it is always meaningful and deeply rewarding. That could involve working in education or government, conducting research to expand our knowledge, inventing new technologies, volunteering for a nonprofit organization, or mentoring more junior colleagues. There are many ways\u00e2\u0080\u0094big and small\u00e2\u0080\u0094to serve. So, as you navigate your lives, ask yourself which paths will allow you to contribute to the greater good.\nConclusion\nGraduates\u00e2\u0080\u0094Spartans\u00e2\u0080\u0094you are entering the wider world, one filled with pressing needs, and countless opportunities. As you make your way, let hope be your constant companion. Heed your curiosity. Honor deep knowledge and thorough, persistent preparation. Embrace public service, however you define it.\nGrowing up, I was often inspired by a poem, popularized by the scholar and spiritual mentor to Martin Luther King, Jr., Howard Thurman: \"I'm tired of sailing my little boat far inside the harbor bar. I want to go out where the big ships float, out on the deep where the great ones are. Should my frail craft prove too slight for those waves that sweep the billows o'er, I'd rather go down in the stirring fight than drowse to death by the sheltered shore.\"\n2\nGraduates, I urge you to plumb the depths of the deep oceans, where you will find the great questions that excite, challenge, and motivate you. You will face rough waters, the route will change, and your destination is not entirely known. As I said, life\u00e2\u0080\u0094like Michigan weather\u00e2\u0080\u0094is going to surprise you. But you are prepared. Your education and your experiences here have armed you with specific knowledge and skills, but also\u00e2\u0080\u0094more importantly\u00e2\u0080\u0094with a honed capacity to be curious, to persistently adapt, to serve, and to hope.\nCongratulations, Class of 2025!

Waller\nAt a Fed Listens Event hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri\nShare\nThank you, Alberto, it is great to be back in St. Louis. And thank you to everyone here for this great turnout, which is itself a big part of what we are trying to accomplish today.\n1\nFed Listens\nis about hearing from the public on the Federal Reserve's approach to monetary policy, and that begins with active and broad participation. Your interest and engagement in the work of the Fed is an essential first step in this process of consultation. In addition to the valuable information that Fed policymakers receive at these events, engagement with the public contributes to a broader understanding of the important role that monetary policy plays in the economy.\nAs we have heard from President Musalem, the Federal Reserve was, in important ways, actually designed to promote this kind of engagement and input from the public. Unusually among agencies of the federal government, the Fed is located in and part of every region of the United States. Reserve Banks such as the St. Louis Fed carry out a number of important functions, but among the most important is ensuring that the concerns and priorities of the communities each Reserve Bank serves are reflected in monetary policy decisions made in Washington.\nThis is something I know very well, having served here as executive vice president and research director for nearly a dozen years. I advised on monetary policy while engaging with people throughout the Eighth District, hearing their concerns about how they were faring in the economy, and how they were affected by inflation, interest rates, and the state of the job market. I learned a lot about the economies of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas (see, I haven't forgotten!). But I learned just as much about how important it is to hear from people directly about their experiences as well as their perceptions, which are sometimes just as consequential for the economy. We call this part of the \"soft\" data that supplements the hard numbers of the government statistics that policymakers eagerly await. The \"hard\" data is indispensable for setting monetary policy, but we can't get a full and detailed picture of the economy without the soft data you can provide.\nFed Listens\nis directly connected to the Fed's review of our long-run goals and strategy for monetary policy, referred to as our framework, which was last updated five years ago. But in a larger sense, it is part of a broader process of consultation with the public that never stops. We know that individuals, families, businesses, and communities are significantly affected by decisions we make to promote a healthy economy. We want\u00e2\u0080\u0094in fact, we\nneed\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094to know how you have been impacted. We need to know how inflation and interest rates are affecting consumers. We need to know how rates are affecting the cost and access to credit by businesses small and large. We need to know how you expect the economy to evolve over the coming months and years, and how that is influencing your plans for the future.\nIn conclusion, I will say again how great it is to be back in St. Louis, and I look forward to hearing from all of you.\nThank you.\n1.

Kugler\nAt the Heller-Hurwicz Economics Institute, University of Minnesota,  Minneapolis, Minnesota\nShare\nThank you, Juan Pablo. I am delighted to be speaking at the University of Minnesota because, in many ways, this visit feels like a homecoming for me.\n1\nI was born right here in Minneapolis, before I moved to Colombia as a young child. My parents told me so many wonderful stories about this area and the university. My father studied for his Ph.D. here at the economics department. He studied under accomplished economists, including Anne Krueger, Leo Hurwicz, John Buttrick, and Ed Foster, the latter of whom is still here as an emeritus professor. The University of Minnesota has made many contributions to the field of economics and has historically had a close relationship with the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. So you really are part of the Fed's extended family, and it is an honor to speak with you.\nToday, I would like to speak with you about the transmission of the Fed's monetary policy. I will discuss how monetary policy is transmitted through the economy, then touch on how I monitor its transmission, and, lastly, talk about two elements related to transmission that I evaluate when making monetary policy decisions. Those elements are the long and variable lags of monetary policy and whether its transmission is asymmetric and has changed over time. But before I delve into my primary topic, I would like to start by offering my views on the economic outlook.\nEconomic Outlook\nThe U.S. economy has grown at a solid pace, with real gross domestic product (GDP) expanding 2.5 percent last year. Activity indicators in the first few months of this year show healthy numbers. Last week, the March retail sales release showed resilient consumption, with positive revisions for January and February numbers. However, measures of household sentiment, such as surveys from the University of Michigan, Conference Board, and Morning Consult, have shown signs of softness, albeit to varying degrees. Many survey respondents report that their views reflect trade policy concerns, though, as we have seen, the exact contours of those policies are still taking shape. Thus, GDP growth for the first quarter, which will be reported next week, may show some moderation relative to what we saw in 2024, although this moderation may be offset by increased purchases front-loading the implementation of tariffs. Financial markets have experienced increased volatility in recent weeks. If financial conditions were to tighten persistently, that could weigh on growth in the future.\nThe labor market remains solid, but the pace of hiring has eased during this year. In the first quarter, U.S. employers added 152,000 jobs per month, on average, compared with a monthly pace of 168,000, on average, last year. The unemployment rate edged up last month to 4.2 percent, but it is still low and has remained near its current level since last summer. Moreover, initial jobless claims have remained stable at low levels. Those numbers are consistent with other measures indicating that the labor market is broadly in balance.\nWith respect to inflation, progress has slowed since last summer, and inflation remains above the 2 percent goal. Based on the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) data, the 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was estimated to have been 2.3 percent last month and 2.6 percent for the core categories, which exclude food and energy.\nI pay careful attention to two subcategories of inflation: first, core goods\u00e2\u0080\u0094which are goods outside of volatile food and energy products\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, second, nonhousing market-based services, which are based on transactions and not imputed prices, such as car maintenance and haircuts. Goods inflation was negative in most of 2024\u00e2\u0080\u0094as was the norm for several years before the pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it increased to 0.4 percent in January and February. In March, the CPI and PPI releases pointed to goods inflation decreasing to a still-positive 0.1 percent, which is better news. By contrast, nonhousing market services inflation stayed elevated through March, at an estimated 3.4 percent. That category often provides a good signal of inflationary pressures across all services. As we look ahead, while the long-run level of tariffs is still to be determined, tariffs have moved significantly higher this year. That will likely put upward pressure on prices. For instance, both survey- and market-based measures of near-term inflation expectations have moved up. Longer-term inflation expectations\u00e2\u0080\u0094those beyond the next few years\u00e2\u0080\u0094largely remain well anchored and consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal, and I hope they continue in that way.\nI am closely monitoring incoming data and the cumulative effects on both sides of our mandate from policies in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. I am also monitoring any risks to the outlook, especially upside risks on inflation or downside risks to employment. Still, I think our monetary policy is well positioned for changes in the macroeconomic environment. Thus, I will support maintaining the current policy rate for as long as these upside risks to inflation continue, while economic activity and employment remain stable. I remain committed to achieving both of our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices.\nOverview of Monetary Policy Transmission\nNow turning to the primary topic of my speech, I will first discuss how monetary policy is transmitted through the economy. In this section, I will give some examples from the recent past as a tool for explaining my arguments, but I am not intending to comment further on the latest developments in the economy.\nUnderstanding the transmission of monetary policy starts with understanding how the Federal Reserve uses its policy tools. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adjusts the target range for the federal funds rate, or the rate that banks pay for overnight borrowing. Setting the federal funds rate is the primary means by which the Fed adjusts the stance of monetary policy, among its range of monetary policy tools. In addition to the FOMC directly adjusting the federal funds rate, Fed policymakers' communications about the future path of monetary policy may also result in changes to longer-term interest rates because households' and businesses' expectations about future policy affect the level of interest rates.\nAdjustments to the federal funds rate affect a multitude of financial conditions faced by consumers and businesses. For example, changes to the federal funds rate filter through to the interest rates lenders charge for loans to businesses and households as well as to what financial institutions pay in interest on deposits. The current and expected future path of the federal funds rate also affects asset prices, as it changes the relative attractiveness of different investments, such as stocks and real estate. Fluctuations in both interest rates and asset prices affect a household's wealth and a corporation's balance sheet, which can, in turn, affect the terms under which they can borrow.\n2\nI have discussed some of the most common ways in which policy is transmitted. There are, of course, other important channels, such as exchange rates and international spillovers, that I will not discuss today. Research suggests that the channels of transmission are extensive and ever evolving.\n3\nConsumers and businesses make decisions based on financial conditions.\n4\nFor illustrative purposes, let's consider a period when FOMC policymakers view it as appropriate to ease the restrictiveness of monetary policy by reducing the target range for the federal funds rate over time. The resulting lower interest rates on consumer loans elicit greater spending on goods and services, particularly on durable goods that are often financed. Lower mortgage rates can encourage renters to buy a home by reducing the monthly payment borrowers face and can encourage existing homeowners to refinance their mortgages to free up cash for other purchases. Lower interest rates can make holding equities more attractive, which raises stock prices and adds to wealth. Higher wealth tends to spur more spending, as households tend to consume at least a portion of their increased wealth. Investment projects that businesses previously believed would be marginally unprofitable become attractive because of reduced financing costs, particularly if businesses expect their sales to rise. Expecting a better macroeconomic environment and lower delinquency rates down the road, banks may loosen their lending standards on approving loans for households and businesses. All these decisions support aggregate demand and may put upward pressure on inflation.\nOf course, there are periods when policymakers see it as appropriate to increase the level of restraint placed on the economy by raising the federal funds rate over time. That may occur when policymakers are seeking to lower inflation. Then, the monetary policy effects I just described would be reversed, putting downward pressure on aggregate demand and inflation.\nDevelopments in Monetary Policy and Financial Conditions\nLet me now discuss how I view the transmission and the stance of monetary policy during the past few quarters. To be clear, I will not discuss the developments in financial markets over the past few weeks.\nIn the second half of last year, I gained greater confidence that inflation was on a sustainable path toward the FOMC's 2 percent objective. I also wanted to preserve the strength I saw in the labor market. As a result, I supported the FOMC's decision to decrease the target range for the federal funds rate by a total of 1 percentage point during the meetings from September through December. However, even before the Committee began to ease policy, some financial conditions started to ease. This easing can be seen in the Financial Conditions Impulse on Growth index.\n5\nThat index, developed by Federal Reserve Board staff, showed easier financial conditions from March 2024. And through January, the demand for loans by households and businesses picked up.\n6\nIn the early months of the year, financial conditions, however, remained somewhat restrictive, as borrowing costs continued to be elevated and bank credit moderately tight. Through March, interest rates on short-term small business loans had only edged down since their post-pandemic peak.\n7\nBanks stopped tightening lending standards after nine consecutive quarters, but they left standards unchanged in January.\n8\nThese financial conditions helped to moderate aggregate demand and aid in moving inflation sustainably toward our 2 percent target.\nDetails of Monetary Policy Transmission\nMonitoring the financial conditions I just described is one important way I evaluate how well the Fed's monetary policy is being transmitted to the rest of the economy. But it is not the only way. I also consider two other elements that play important roles in the transmission of our monetary policy.\nTiming Matters\nThe first element to evaluate is the timing with which monetary policy affects the macroeconomy. The contemporary economics literature uses a variety of statistical models to estimate the effects of what are called monetary policy \"shocks.\" Those are movements in the policy rate that are not explained by estimates of how monetary policy systematically responds to incoming economic and financial data and are not anticipated by the public.\n9\nFocusing on the estimated effects of these shocks helps isolate the consequences solely coming from monetary policy actions and communications. One lesson that emerges from this research is that, broadly speaking, it turns out that Milton Friedman's \"long and variable lags\" concept still holds.\n10\nA selection of key studies on the topic estimates that it takes about one to two years for the maximum effects of policy to be observed in economic activity and inflation.\n11\nThese long lags in monetary policy affecting the economy point to why it is important for policymakers to anticipate economic conditions as best as possible and try to be proactive about understanding the effects of different shocks to the economy, so they can act quickly when needed.\nDirection of Travel\nThe second element to consider when making decisions related to monetary policy is whether its transmission has been equally impactful during different points in time. For example, credible evidence indicates that contractionary monetary shocks may generally decrease economic activity more strongly than expansionary shocks increase it.\n12\nTo understand these asymmetric effects, consider the following illustrative metaphor used by Marriner Eccles, who led the Fed back in the 1930s.\nImagine a string with monetary policy at one end and the economy at the other. Employing tight monetary policy when inflation is rising is like pulling on the string to keep the economy in check\u00e2\u0080\u0094it works fairly well. But attempting to stimulate the economy with loose policy during a downturn is like trying to push on the string to move the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0094a more difficult task.\nThere is evidence of this asymmetry in consumer spending on long-lasting durable goods, such as vehicles and appliances. While an easier monetary policy may lower interest rates and thus stimulate spending on durable goods in the near term, the effects of that policy may be smaller over time, as households may have already purchased durable goods.\n13\nIf a family replaces their living room furniture when rates are low, they are unlikely to need a new set of furniture a few years later and thus would not consider how current rates would change their decisions. Thus, during an easing cycle, it is reasonable to suspect that the potency of monetary policy may be somewhat diminished.\nAnother example of asymmetry can be seen in the transmission of monetary policy to private lending. Board staff research documented strong growth in the period between the Global Financial Crisis and the pandemic, fueled by structural factors, such as the attractiveness of the market to borrowers and investors due to its higher customization.\n14\nOne implication of this strong growth during this past policy tightening is that monetary policy transmission to private credit markets appeared more muted relative to financing through public credit markets or bank commercial and industrial lending.\nBy contrast, other factors specific to the recent period likely decreased the potency of monetary policy during the tightening cycle but may increase it during the easing cycle.

Jefferson\nAt the Economic Mobility Summit, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nShare\nThank you, Dr. Singleton, for the kind introduction and for the opportunity to speak here today.\n1\nIt is great to be back in Philadelphia, and I look forward to today's discussions on economic mobility.\nTitle slide\nAs monetary policymakers, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee do not have direct control over economic mobility in the U.S. Our key monetary policy tools are not designed to address this issue, nor is economic mobility part of our mandate. However, our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability has implications for a wide range of economic outcomes, including economic mobility. This leads to many important questions about the relationship between the dual mandate and economic mobility. In my remarks, I want to address two such questions. First, does meeting the dual mandate facilitate economic mobility? And second, does economic mobility matter for the conduct of monetary policy?\nIn\ntoday's talk\n, I will discuss my views on these questions, but I will not be able to provide definitive answers. Rather, I hope that posing these questions and relaying some of my own thoughts will lead to further discussions during this conference and beyond. Before turning to these questions, let me start with a brief overview of intergenerational mobility in the U.S.\nTaking Stock of Economic Mobility\nEconomic mobility, the ability to move up the economic ladder, is at the heart of the American dream. We tell our children that in the U.S., if you work hard and play by the rules, you can have a secure and successful financial future no matter where you start. We continue to believe strongly in this part of the American dream and remain optimistic that hard work is a primary determinant of later-life success. In a survey from 2019, when respondents were asked which factors are essential or very important to getting ahead in life, nearly 90 percent identified hard work, and only 30 percent indicated coming from a wealthy family.\n2\nPolicymakers have long been aware of the importance of economic mobility. To illustrate that, let me share a quote from former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke: \"Equality of economic opportunity appeals to our sense of fairness, certainly, but it also strengthens our economy. If each person is free to develop and apply his or her talents to the greatest extent possible, then both the individual and the economy benefit.\"\n3\nWith these sentiments of what Americans and policymakers think and feel about mobility in mind, let me turn to some evidence on economic mobility in the U.S. One common way to measure economic mobility is to relate an individual's income in adulthood to their family income during childhood. The measure I am showing\nhere\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094from Harvard economist Raj Chetty and coauthors\u00e2\u0080\u0094is likely familiar to many of you.\n4\nIt shows a relative intergenerational mobility measure, also known as the \"rank\u00e2\u0080\u0093rank\" relationship. This measure relates a child's ranking in the income distribution as an adult, shown on the vertical axis, to the child's family income rank during childhood, shown on the horizontal axis.\nThe upward slope of the line implies that children born into lower-income families tend to be lower on the income distribution as adults. For example, a child born to the richest parents is, on average, 30 percentage points higher in the income distribution as an adult compared with a child born to the poorest parents. This difference in the relative standing in the income distribution as an adult translates into meaningful differences in earnings levels. To put this in perspective, consider two children who grow up to be 30 percentile points apart on the earnings distribution as adults, with one at the 80th percentile and the other at the 50th percentile. The child who grows up to be at the 80th percentile of the distribution as an adult will earn roughly twice as much compared with the child at the 50th percentile.\n5\nIn addition to having lower earnings as adults, children born into lower-income families are more likely to experience outcomes that can negatively affect their success in the labor market later in life. Girls born into the bottom decile of the family income distribution are about 10 times more likely to become teenage mothers compared with those born to top-decile families.\n6\nBoys born into bottom-decile families are roughly 20 times more likely to be incarcerated in their thirties compared with boys from families in the top decile.\n7\nTeen pregnancy and incarceration are extreme examples of barriers to labor market success that differentially affect children from lower-income families. More generally, there are numerous reasons that any individual may struggle in the labor market, including skill mismatches and lack of proper training or education.\nDoes Meeting the Dual Mandate Facilitate Economic Mobility?\nNow, let me turn to the Fed's dual mandate and discuss how working toward maximum employment and price stability helps set the stage for broad-based success generally, and how this may provide favorable conditions for upward mobility.\nConsider my first question: Does meeting the dual mandate facilitate economic mobility? To help answer this question, I want to revisit remarks I delivered earlier this year about the implications of noninflationary expansions on shared prosperity.\n8\nSpecifically, I am reflecting on the economic expansion that followed the 2007\u00e2\u0080\u009309 Global Financial Crisis (GFC). During that period, the economy expanded for 128 consecutive months, making it the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.\nAs shown in\nfigure 2\n, the aggregate unemployment rate fell steadily from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009 to 3.5 percent in September 2019, the lowest level recorded in nearly 50 years. The labor market in this period was remarkable in terms of broad-based gains seen across demographic groups, which contributed to a historic narrowing of employment differentials. To illustrate this point, let's add in unemployment rates by levels of education, as shown in\nfigure 3\n. In 2019, the unemployment rate gaps between workers with less than a high school education, the solid green line near the top of the chart, and those who had attained at least a bachelor's degree, the solid orange line closer to the bottom, were near multidecade lows. Further, the strong pre-pandemic labor market drew many new participants into the labor force, including teens and younger workers whose employment prospects, and even long-term career trajectories, are especially sensitive to the cyclical state of the economy.\n9\nThese are the types of labor market conditions that the economist Arthur Okun speculated would increase upward mobility.\n10\nIn a tight labor market, when individuals move up the job ladder, they create openings for newer or less educated workers.\nMoving on to earnings,\nfigure 4\nshows that nominal wage growth increased steadily following the GFC. As with gains in employment, the strong labor market was especially beneficial for some groups. To demonstrate that, let's turn to\nfigure 5\n, which shows wage growth for different earnings levels. Wage growth for the bottom half of earners, the dashed red line, started to pick up about five years into the expansion, and by 2017, it was notably stronger compared with that for workers in the top half of the earnings distribution, the solid blue line.\n11\nThese differences in wage growth are important. As the bottom of the distribution catches up to higher earners, wage inequality declines. These are also dynamics that can facilitate upward economic mobility.\nLet me now turn to the second component of the dual mandate, price stability. While some long economic expansions have led to an unwelcome rise in prices, inflation remained low and stable during the economic expansion following the GFC. Indeed, Federal Reserve policymakers were grappling with inflation somewhat below, rather than above, the longer-run 2 percent target, as shown in\nfigure 6\n.\nLow and stable inflation is important for individuals and businesses for a variety of reasons. It ensures that the nominal wage gains I just discussed are not eroded in real terms and that necessities remain affordable. In addition, it helps individuals and families plan for major purchases, such as a car or home, and for major expenses, including retirement and college.\nI want to highlight one of these major expenses\u00e2\u0080\u0094higher education\u00e2\u0080\u0094as attending college is an important pathway for upward mobility. Looking at\nfigure 7\n, higher education inflation is shown by the red line. A variety of factors affect the cost of college generally, including student loan costs, state funding, and administrative overhead. Nonetheless, when inflation was low for an extended period during the economic expansion that followed the GFC, we also saw a moderation in the growth of higher education costs.\n12\nTo illustrate the importance of college attendance for mobility, let me\nreturn\nto the rank\u00e2\u0080\u0093rank intergenerational mobility relationship I showed earlier. As before, the darkest dots show the national child-income-rank-to-parent-income-rank relationship. Now consider how this relationship looks across different types of higher education. The red line shows elite four-year colleges, the green line shows the remaining four-year institutions, and the lighter-blue line shows two-year schools. As you can see from the colored lines, the relationship between family income rank and later-life income rank is weaker\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, the slope of the line is flatter\u00e2\u0080\u0094within each type of college than it is nationally.\nThe flatter slope indicates that outcomes for children from lower-income families are more similar to outcomes for children from higher-income families within each college type than they are overall. In this way, higher education is an important source of upward mobility for many youths and a pathway to a more secure financial future. Of course, the relatively steeper national relationship holds because there are meaningful differences in college enrollment over the family income distribution.\nGoing back to my initial question, I asked whether meeting the dual mandate facilitates economic mobility. I think that achieving the dual mandate sets the conditions for all individuals to succeed, including those moving up the economic ladder. The evidence suggests that long noninflationary expansions are associated with narrower gaps in employment and earnings, and that lower-wage and less-educated workers benefit disproportionately from sustained periods of strong economic growth. Further, achieving price stability allows individuals and households to plan for and make investments in human capital, such as attending college, that may allow individuals to move up the income distribution.\n13\nDoes Economic Mobility Matter for the Conduct of Monetary Policy?\nBefore I conclude, I want to return to my second question: Does economic mobility matter for the conduct of monetary policy? As I mentioned earlier, economic mobility is not part of the Federal Reserve's mandate, and our monetary policy tools are blunt instruments for affecting economic mobility. For example, interest rates affect the entire economy, not targeted populations, and rate changes operate through financial markets rather than directly influencing labor market outcomes.\nOne way that economic mobility could matter for the conduct of monetary policy is if the goals of monetary policy are easier to achieve in a high-mobility society compared with one with low mobility. I do not know if this is true, but let me offer some conjectures. I think that a society with relatively higher mobility may allow for more efficient transmission of monetary policy. In a dynamic economy with relatively more upward mobility, individuals may have greater incentives to be proactive in the job market. They may seek new and better job opportunities, which could allow for a quicker path to maximum employment following economic downturns. Further, individuals and households may hold additional savings for increased investments in human capital when mobility is relatively higher, allowing for more effective transmission of monetary policy. Stepping back, I pose this question not to offer a definitive answer, but rather to serve as one potential starting point for your discussions here today.\nConclusion\nLet me conclude by pointing out that the patterns we observe in our economy, including those for economic mobility, are not predetermined. Outcomes can and will change as we learn more about effective strategies to improve and maintain economic mobility in the U.S. By joining in these conversations here today, and by continuing to research and describe the patterns of economic mobility, you are helping society understand the dynamics of our economy better and find new and innovative ways to help keep the American dream of economic mobility alive and well.

Barr\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, New York\nShare\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today about artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity.\n1\nIn the past, a skilled forger could pass a bad check by replicating a person's signature. Now, advances in AI can do much more damage by replicating a person's entire identity. This technology\u00e2\u0080\u0094known as deepfakes\u00e2\u0080\u0094has the potential to supercharge identity fraud. I've recently spoken about the importance of recognizing both the benefits and the risks of generative AI (Gen AI).\n2\nToday, I'd like to focus more on the darker side of the technology\u00e2\u0080\u0094specifically how Gen AI has the potential to enable deepfake technology, and what we should be doing now to defend against this risk in finance.\nEscalating Threat of Gen-AI Facilitated Cybercrime\nCybercrime is on the rise, and cybercriminals are increasingly turning to Gen AI to facilitate their crimes. Criminal tactics are becoming more sophisticated and available to a broader range of criminals. Estimates of direct and indirect costs of cyber incidents range from 1 to 10 percent of global GDP.\n3\nDeepfake attacks have seen a twentyfold increase over the last three years.\n4\nCybercrime with deepfakes involves the same cat and mouse game common to sophisticated criminal activity. Both cybercriminals and financial institutions are constantly trying to outdo each other. Criminals develop new attack methods, and companies respond with better defenses. Here, the same technological innovations that enable the bad actors can also help those fighting cybercrime. However, there is an asymmetry\u00e2\u0080\u0094the fraudsters can cast a wide net of approaches and target a wide number of victims, and they only need a small number to be successful. Their marginal cost is generally low, and individual failures matter little. Conversely, companies must undergo a rigorous review and testing process to mount effective cyber defenses and will thus be slower in developing their defenses. A single failure is very costly. As we consider this issue from a policy perspective, we need to take steps to make attacks less likely by raising the cost of the attack to the cybercriminals and lowering the costs of defense to financial institutions and law enforcement.\nAnatomy of a Deepfake\nDeepfake attacks are those in which an attacker uses Gen AI to create a doppelganger with a person's voice or image and uses this doppelganger to interact with individuals or institutions to commit fraud. Deepfake technology is a particularly pernicious vehicle for cybercrime.\n5\nThe process begins with voice synthesis, where Gen AI models can synthesize the speech of their victim not only in words, but also in phrase patterns, tone, and inflection. With just a short sample audio, for example, criminals assisted by Gen AI can impersonate a close relative in a crisis situation or a high-value bank client, seeking to complete a transaction at their bank.\n6\nCriminals can also use Gen AI-generated videos to create believable depictions of individuals. For videos, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are the core technology behind most deepfake systems.\n7\nGANs consist of two competing models, the generator and the discriminator, which compete with and improve each other. This competition results in increasingly realistic, indistinguishable fake images and videos.\n8\nDeepfake technology can also be augmented by other AI tools; for instance, criminals can use AI to extract and organize extensive multimodal personal data to facilitate identity verification. Attackers can also turn to \"dark web\" tools, such as jailbroken versions of popular large language models, where the guardrails have been removed, to learn the deepfake trade and improve their attacks.\n9\nDeepfakes in Action\nI expect that many of you can recall examples of how deepfakes of politicians and prominent business executives have fooled the public and spread disinformation. Deepfakes are also being used to commit payment fraud. In one case in 2024, a sophisticated deepfake of the chief financial officer for British engineering and architectural firm Arup was reportedly deployed in a video meeting and convinced an Arup financial employee to transfer $25 million to thieves.\n10\nIn another case, an attacker attempted to undertake a highly convincing audio deepfake of the chief executive of Ferrari, down to mimicking his southern Italian accent.\n11\nThe recipient of the attack\u00e2\u0080\u0094another Ferrari executive\u00e2\u0080\u0094tested the caller with a personal question only the chief executive would know, which thankfully exposed the fraud.\nAnd these institutions and individuals are not alone\u00e2\u0080\u0094a 2024 survey finds that over 10 percent of companies reported experiencing deepfake fraud attempts, and few steps have been taken to mitigate the risks.\n12\nParticularly since COVID, we conduct much of our professional and personal lives over video. When we see realistic and interactive video images of a loved one in trouble, we are disposed to trust them and do what we can to help. Identity verification standards at banks often use voice detection, which may become vulnerable to Gen AI tools. If this technology becomes cheaper and more broadly available to criminals\u00e2\u0080\u0094and fraud detection technology does not keep pace\u00e2\u0080\u0094we are all vulnerable to a deepfake attack. These attacks can have significant financial costs to the victims of the crime and can also pose costs to society, eroding trust in communications and in institutions.\nDefending Against Deepfakes\nSo what should we do? As I mentioned above, we should take steps to lessen the impact of attacks by making successful breaches less likely, while making each attack more resource-intensive for the attacker.\nLet me start with ways to make successful breaches less likely. A key step is to recognize the importance of strong, resilient financial institutions in preventing attacks. Banks are frontline defenders against deepfake-enabled fraud due to their direct involvement with financial transactions and customer data. To verify payors, banks maintain identity verification processes, including multi-factor authentication and account monitoring practices. To the extent deepfakes increase, bank identity verification processes should evolve in kind to include AI-powered advances such as facial recognition, voice analysis, and behavioral biometrics to detect potential deepfakes. Other techniques focus on assessing the probability that AI has been used in audio or video based on underlying metadata and then flagging the identity or transaction for further review using other verification. These technical solutions can detect subtle inconsistencies in video and audio that human observers may miss.\nBanks have two points of control over the transaction\u00e2\u0080\u0094confirming not only the sender's identity, but also the legitimacy of the recipient address. They can scrutinize the recipients of large or unusual transactions, employing advanced analytics to flag suspicious patterns that could indicate fraudulent activities, and perform additional reviews before authorizing a payment to a recipient that raises flags. Banks also invest in their human controls by maintaining up-to-date training for staff on the emerging risks and incorporating the necessary security measures to mitigate the damages from breaches when they occur. And they are engaging with other financial institutions to help define the threat and identify appropriate controls and mitigants.\n13\nCustomers should do their part, enabling multi-factor authentication on their accounts and verifying unusual requests through a separate channel, even if the person making the request seems genuine. They should seek out education for themselves and their loved ones to help them detect and prevent fraud before it occurs.\n14\nAnd customers should value strong security practices at their financial institutions, including those which may add some friction to the user experience. The customers that may be the highest-value targets for criminals are often those with the largest digital presence, and thus most susceptible to deepfakes. They are also the customers who may prefer the most frictionless user experience, making detecting deepfakes more difficult. When it comes to protecting our money, we ought to expect and appreciate a little friction.\nRegulators can help to reinforce the importance of cyber defenses in safe and sound banking through appropriate updates to guidance and regulation. As with all rules, we should be mindful of the impacts on smaller institutions and help ensure that rules are right-sized for the risk. In addition, we can work with core providers to understand the extent to which they are incorporating AI advancements in their products and services to help smaller banks defend against deepfakes and other emerging risks from the technology. Last, we can also highlight research and development for cybersecurity startups and research into tools to combat deepfakes and Gen AI-based fraud.\nRegulators should consider how we could leverage AI technologies ourselves, including to enhance our ability to monitor and detect patterns of fraudulent activity at regulated institutions in real time. This could help provide early warnings to affected institutions and broader industry participants, as well as to protect our own systems.\nIn addition to preventing attacks, we should also explore ways of making attacks more costly. These may include coordination with domestic and global law enforcement, internationally consistent laws against cybercrime, and continued improvement on sharing threat intelligence and insights in real-time. The official sector and banks should continue efforts to improve fraud data sharing within the financial sector and help institutions respond more quickly to emerging Gen AI-driven threats. This will make it far harder for fraudsters to operate undetected, increasing the complexity and cost of their activities. But the sharing is only as good as the data, and banks must do their part. We should help ensure that banks and other regulated institutions meet their duties to report cyber incidents in a timely way, and regulators should too.\n15\nAnother way to disrupt the economics of cybercrime is by increasing penalties for attempting to use Gen AI to commit fraud and increasing investment in cybercrime enforcement. This includes targeting the upstream organizations that benefit from illegal action and strengthening anti-money-laundering laws to disrupt illicit fund flows and freeze assets related to cybercrime. The fear of severe legal consequences could help to deter bad actors from pursuing AI-driven fraud schemes in the first place.\nConclusion\nDeepfakes are only one of many new techniques to facilitate cyberattacks, but they feel particularly salient because they are so personal. And they are on the rise.\nWe will need financial institutions to adapt, collaborate, and innovate in the face of these emerging threats.\nThank you.\n1.

Powell\nAt the Economic Club of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for the introduction. I am looking forward to our conversation, Professor Rajan. First, I will briefly discuss the outlook for the economy and monetary policy.\nAt the Fed, we are always focused on the dual-mandate goals given to us by Congress: maximum employment and stable prices. Despite heightened uncertainty and downside risks, the U.S. economy is still in a solid position. The labor market is at or near maximum employment. Inflation has come down a great deal but is running a bit above our 2 percent objective.\nRecent Economic Data\nTurning to the incoming data, we will get the initial reading on first-quarter GDP in a couple of weeks. The data in hand so far suggest that growth has slowed in the first quarter from last year's solid pace. Despite strong motor vehicle sales, overall consumer spending appears to have grown modestly. In addition, strong imports during the first quarter, reflecting attempts by businesses to get ahead of potential tariffs, are expected to weigh on GDP growth.\nSurveys of households and businesses report a sharp decline in sentiment and elevated uncertainty about the outlook, largely reflecting trade policy concerns. Outside forecasts for the full year are coming down and, for the most part, point to continued slowing but still positive growth. We are closely tracking incoming data as households and businesses continue to digest these developments.\nIn the labor market, during the first three months of the year, nonfarm payrolls grew by an average of 150,000 jobs a month. While job growth has slowed relative to last year, the combination of low layoffs and lower labor force growth has kept the unemployment rate in a low and stable range. Meanwhile, the ratio of job openings to unemployed job seekers has remained just above 1, near its pre-pandemic level. Wage growth has continued to moderate while still outpacing inflation. Overall, the labor market appears to be in solid condition and broadly in balance and is not a significant source of inflationary pressure.\nAs for our price-stability mandate, inflation has significantly eased from its pandemic highs of mid-2022 without the kind of painful rise in unemployment that has frequently accompanied efforts to bring down high inflation. Progress on inflation continues at a gradual pace, and recent readings remain above our 2 percent objective. Estimates based on data released last week show that total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in March and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.6 percent.\nLooking forward, the new Administration is in the process of implementing substantial policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. Those policies are still evolving, and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain. As we learn more, we will continue to update our assessment. The level of the tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated. The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth. Both survey- and market-based measures of near-term inflation expectations have moved up significantly, with survey participants pointing to tariffs. Survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations, for the most part, appear to remain well anchored; market-based breakevens continue to run close to 2 percent.\nMonetary Policy\nAs we gain a better understanding of the policy changes, we will have a better sense of the implications for the economy, and hence for monetary policy. Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation. The inflationary effects could also be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\nOur obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem. As we act to meet that obligation, we will balance our maximum employment and price-stability mandates, keeping in mind that, without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor market conditions that benefit all Americans. We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are in tension. If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close.\nConclusion\nAs that great Chicagoan Ferris Bueller once noted, \"Life moves pretty fast.\" For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance. We continue to analyze the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We understand that elevated levels of unemployment or inflation can be damaging and painful for communities, families, and businesses. We will continue to do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            April 16, 2025",

Cook\nAt the Cal Alumni Club of Washington, D.C. Annual Reception, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nThank you, Dr. Rogers, and go Bears!\nThank you to the Cal Alumni Club of Washington, D.C. for this honor.\n1\nIt is humbling to be in the company of so many other accomplished Cal alumni. And it is especially meaningful to receive this award from a university that has already given me so much. I am eternally grateful for my time at Berkeley and in my economics Ph.D. program, because it was a transformative experience that shaped me not only as an economist, but more importantly as a person. Again, I am deeply grateful for this honor.\nI know there is a lot going on in the news at the moment, so let me just start by saying that I do not plan to discuss policy or the current economic situation this evening. Instead, I want to keep the attention on the energetic and dedicated Cal alums here tonight and the wonderful university we all call home. I will talk about the way in which Berkeley profoundly influenced my thinking, which has served me well throughout my career, and will share a few memories from my time on campus.\nI would love to see who we have here tonight. First, where are the econ majors? Who lived in the International House? Now, where are the recent alums, say those who graduated in the past 5 years? (Congratulations, welcome to Washington.) Who here has graduated since 2010? Who here is in my generation and graduated in the 90s or early 2000s? And do we have some true Cal legends among us that are celebrating 40 or more years as a Golden Bear this spring? (Let's give them a round of applause.)\nNo matter when you attended Cal or how long you have been away, I think we can all agree that Berkeley is a special place that stays in your heart. I grew up in the South, and by the time I arrived at Berkeley, I had the good fortune to have spent time living in Africa and Europe. Even with this experience, what immediately stood out to me was the campus's openness to many different cultures and ideas. And a clear way this was expressed, as I am sure you will recall, was through the abundance of delicious food. Berkeley was truly like heaven for this former founder of a cooking school. Better coffee and cuisine than anywhere else in the country. Dim sum everywhere, vegan and vegetarian options galore, and that sourdough at Great Harvest Bread. (You cannot blame a hungry grad student for stopping in for samples.) When I was there, Berkeley was at the forefront of the farm-to-table and healthy eating movements. I remember being in awe of the produce at Berkeley Bowl. They had five or six types of yams and sweet potatoes. I am from Georgia, and I had never seen so many yams!\nThe wonderful food served as a perfect canvas upon which to share ideas. Sometimes that was having dinner at each other's apartments, and sometimes it was slipping over to the cafeteria between Bechtel and Evans to have lunch with my friends in engineering and computer science. Shockingly, the Cal engineers had nicer facilities than the econ students in Evans Hall. By the way, Evans Hall is described on Cal's own websites as a \"dark, closed-in design. . . spoiling the main east-west axis of the campus.\" Ouch, but I told you, open to ideas!\n2\nFrom these lunches and many other conversations at Berkeley, I learned the value of exchanging ideas and the free disposal of ideas. The next idea will come; be unafraid to try new things. Do not be wedded to bad ideas. I learned the value of working in teams and acknowledging and leveraging everyone's varied scholarly and lived expertise. I learned the value of sharing and collaboration. This fosters the spirit of innovation that drives the Bay area. You can see why many of the greatest advancements in the past century have come from that region of the country, many directly from Cal alumni.\nIt was awe-inspiring to be surrounded by so many outstanding students and stellar faculty members from many disciplines. The work of Cal researchers has changed the world. I often wondered what inspired these great minds. Then one day, while traversing the always congested campus, I saw it\u00e2\u0080\u0094the real incentive for great minds: Nobel laureates received reserved parking spaces. All of you who have fought Bay Area traffic and Berkeley campus parking restrictions know that tops any prize you can receive in Sweden!\nBut seriously, I was extremely lucky to have an amazing group of professors and supporters at Cal. Barry Eichengreen was my dissertation adviser, and George Akerlof was an informal adviser who was just curious about economies undergoing market transitions. Janet Yellen and Laura Tyson were inspirations. They epitomized the commitment to public service that flows through the Berkley campus. When I arrived, Dr. Tyson had recently left to become chair of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). Of course, Dr. Yellen would soon serve as chair of CEA as well as those of Fed chair and Treasury Secretary, the only person in history to hold all three positions. I had the mentorship and support of a whole bunch of Romers: Christina, David, and Paul. Christina would also serve as CEA Chair as we climbed out of the Global Financial Crisis\nI arrived on campus in 1991 the very week the Soviet Union started breaking up and the Russian Soviet Socialist Republic became just Russia. This series of events gave the world an unfiltered view of a Russian economy blinking into the sunlight after decades of central planning and stagnation. I asked, what would happen next, and what could we learn from this historic event? I was desperate to explore those questions and to explore them with Greg Grossman. No one in the world knew more about the Soviet and Russian economies than he did.\nHowever, he had other thoughts\u00e2\u0080\u0094namely, retirement. When I asked him to advise me, he was hesitant. So, he presented me with a challenge. He said the only way to study the Russian banking system and economy was to become fluent in Russian. If I could learn the language, he would delay his retirement to advise me, along with Eichengreen. I could tell he thought his retirement plans were safe with that lofty goal. A year and a half later, I walked into his office and struck up a conversation in Russian. I could see his heart sink. I had won the challenge. (What he did not know then was that I had already learned four other languages and was blessed with the ability to pick up new ones quickly.) Once he agreed to stay on, I was off and running.\nI plowed through Tsarist-era statistical tables stashed in the depths of Bancroft Library. Later, I would travel to Moscow and collect data from the Russian Statistical Agency and eventually survey and conduct interviews with Russian bankers and entrepreneurs. I credit my Berkeley professors, particularly Barry, Greg, George, and Paul, for supporting the curiosity that took me to Moscow and many other distant places to do research and push forward the field of economics with new questions, data, and analysis. I especially thank them for asking tough, thoughtful questions that prepared me to approach any situation of heightened uncertainty and in which standard models and the conventional wisdom in economics may not apply.\nOne aspect that stood out about the Berkeley experience was that we defended our dissertations at the proposal stage rather than upon completion. This arrangement was not common at the time but is now becoming a more frequent practice at other schools. It sets up the dynamic of these experienced, knowledgeable professors looking for constructive ways to allow experimentation to ultimately bring ideas to fruition. It is this sense of collaboration and openness that I have taken from Berkeley and brought with me everywhere I have gone\u00e2\u0080\u0094through universities, banks, the government, and now at the Federal Reserve.\nThere is a special way you learn to think at Berkeley. I hope you continue to carry that spirit in all you do here in Washington and beyond.\nThank you again for this tremendous honor. I will always be a proud Cal alumna.\n1.

Waller\nAt the Certified Financial Analysts Society of St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri\nShare\nThank you, Jack and thank you to the CFA of St. Louis for the opportunity to speak to you today. It's a pleasure to be back home here in the city where I worked for nearly 12 years before becoming a Governor at the Federal Reserve Board.\nI am here to discuss my favorite topic, which is the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy.\n1\nI speak publicly on the outlook every few weeks or so, and usually the most exciting thing to happen in between these appearances is a monthly data release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Commerce Department.\nThis time, of course, is different. The tariff increases announced April 2 were dramatically larger than I anticipated, adding on to other tariffs announced in March, along with retaliatory actions from some countries. Combining all of these actions to date, it is clear that tariffs this large and broadly applied could significantly affect the economy and the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) pursuit of our economic objectives. Given that there is still so much uncertainty about how trade policy will play out and how businesses and households will respond, I have struggled, like many others I have talked with, to fit these varying possibilities into a single coherent view of the outlook.\nIt is an understatement to say that financial markets did not respond well to the April 2 tariff announcement. Then last Wednesday, a substantial proportion of the newest tariffs were suspended for 90 days pending negotiations to lower them, reportedly in exchange for lower barriers to U.S. exporters. This left in place a 10 percent tariff on all imports, the pre-existing tariffs on some products and countries, and a sharp increase in import and export tariffs on China trade. More sector-specific tariffs are promised, and much uncertainty remains about whether tariff negotiations will lead to deals or whether the April 2 tariffs will be implemented in 90 days.\nUncertainty about trade or fiscal policy decisions is precisely why you won't hear me talking about such actions very often. It is why I avoided speaking in detail about proposed tariffs earlier this year. I do not judge such policy actions. But I must base my policy decisions on the actions taken. Tariffs are the elephant in the room, so let's talk about them.\nAs I said a moment ago, I struggled after April 2 to come up with a single coherent view of how the tariff increases would affect my outlook and views on monetary policy. That difficulty did not end after the 90-day tariff suspensions announced on April 9, which, if anything, may have widened the range of possible outcomes and effects and made the timing even less certain. Friday's exemptions for some tariffs on some electronics imports from China only complicated the picture. Considering all this uncertainty, it is impossible to forecast how the economy will evolve very far into the future. In such circumstances, I tend to think in terms of scenarios and managing the associated risks. So, for the balance of my remarks, I will try to lay out some possible tariff scenarios and how they will affect my thinking about the appropriate path for monetary policy in the coming months.\nBut before I get to this exercise, it is essential to understand how the economy was faring leading up to this big change in trade policy. As I will detail, in my view, the economy was on a fairly solid footing in the first quarter of 2025. While the evidence suggests real gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed from a 2.4 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, I believe the economy did grow modestly in the first quarter and that growth would have been stronger except for some special factors that are unlikely to continue.\nA variety of \"soft\" data\u00e2\u0080\u0094reports from business contacts and a range of consumer and business surveys\u00e2\u0080\u0094hinted at a substantial slowdown. The \"hard\" data, which includes actual measurement and estimates of aggregate economic conditions, have tended to show that the economy grew modestly. While monthly readings through February show consumer spending slowed from the fourth quarter, that may have reflected unusual seasonal factors that weighed on spending in the first two months of this year, including harsh winter weather. We will get March retail sales later this week, and that should provide some helpful evidence of the pace of consumer spending. Another factor counted against measured GDP growth in the first quarter was a surge in imports, likely an anticipatory effect caused by the prospect of the new tariffs, which probably won't continue. In the labor market, employment grew 228,000 in March, exceeding expectations, and job openings through February indicated that the labor market remained roughly in balance. In light of the continuing strength of the labor market and factors that probably temporarily lowered GDP growth, I think the U.S. economy was in good shape in the first quarter.\nInflation has had a bumpy path down toward our 2 percent goal, and progress seemed to stall last year. But after some high inflation readings in January and February, we got some encouraging news last Thursday on consumer price index (CPI) inflation. Headline CPI prices fell 0.1 percent in March, bringing the 12-month measure of CPI inflation down to 2.4 percent. A drop in energy prices\u00e2\u0080\u0094which has continued so far this month\u00e2\u0080\u0094was a big reason for the step-down. Core CPI inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices and is a good guide to future inflation, rose just a tenth of a percent last month, which brought the 12-month change down to 2.8 percent, its lowest 12-month reading since March 2021.\nWhen CPI data is supplemented with the producer price data that we received last week, we estimate that the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the FOMC's preferred inflation gauge, was roughly unchanged in March bringing the 12-month change to 2.3 percent. Core PCE prices are estimated to have risen less than 0.1 percent for the month, leaving core PCE inflation at 2.7 percent over the previous 12 months. Both measures of total and core PCE inflation were above the FOMC's 2 percent goal.\nLooking across the first-quarter data, I see the economy growing modestly with a labor market that was still solid and inflation that was still too high but was making slow progress toward our goal of 2 percent.\nLet me now return to tariffs and my scenarios. To level set the discussion of tariffs, as of December 2024, the effective average trade-weighted tariff for all imports into the United States was under 3 percent. Earlier this year, targeted tariffs brought the average to 10 percent. The April 2\ntariffs would have pushed that to 25 percent or more. Even with the pause on implementing those tariffs, retaining the new 10 percent tariff on most imports and a tariff on Chinese imports of well over 100 percent, estimates are that the average effective tariff today is still around 25 percent. This estimate is rough, and we have seen that policy can change quickly, but the point is that even after the 90-day pause, the current tariff rate is a sharp increase to a level that the United States has not experienced for at least a century.\nThe primary challenge in analyzing the economic effects of the tariff increases is the considerable uncertainty that remains about their size and permanence. So I have decided to focus on two scenarios for tariff policy when thinking about the economic response. One possibility is that they will remain very high and be long-lasting, near the current average of 25 percent or more, as part of a committed effort by the Administration to engineer a fundamental shift in the U.S. economy toward producing more goods domestically and reducing trade deficits. The second scenario is that the suspensions are the beginning of a concerted effort to negotiate reductions in foreign barriers faced by U.S. exporters that will result in the removal of most of the announced import tariffs, which would reduce the average tariff rate to around 10 percent. This latter scenario had been my base case up until March 1. While there is a range of possibilities that could combine these objectives for tariff policy, these two approaches would yield significantly different outcomes for the economy and monetary policy, so I would like to discuss them today as two separate scenarios.\nIn doing so, I am not here to judge the objectives for the tariff increases. I am a central banker, and, as I said earlier, that means I take fiscal and other policy decisions made by others as a given when setting monetary policy.\nBefore I summarize my two scenarios, let me emphasize that neither of them are forecasts and that I am employing scenarios as a way to frame my thinking about managing the risks of decision making when the outlook is as uncertain as it is. The \"large tariff\" scenario assumes that average tariffs around 25 percent will remain in place for some time. Let's assume they remain at that level until at least the end of 2027, which is the horizon for economic projections made by FOMC participants. In my view, keeping the large tariffs in place this long would be necessary if the primary goal is remaking the U.S. economy, which is now mostly services, into one that produces a larger share of the goods it consumes. Such a shift, if it is possible, would be a dramatic change for the United States and would surely take longer than three years.\nIn the second scenario, it is assumed that the primary goal would be to use the tariffs as leverage to negotiate reductions in trade barriers faced by U.S. exporters. In this case, while I would expect that the announced minimum 10 percent tariff on all goods from all countries would remain in place, I would also expect that substantially all other tariffs would be eliminated over time. I will call this the \"smaller tariff\" scenario.\nLet me begin with the large tariff scenario and the implications for inflation. As I have noted in past speeches, the textbook view of tariffs is that they are a one-time increase in prices and would not be expected to be a persistent source of inflationary pressure.\n2\nWhile the tariffs after April 9 were very large, I still believe they would have only a temporary effect on inflation.\nPrivate sector forecasts expect tariff increases of this magnitude to increase inflation by 1-1/2 to 2 percentage points over the next year or so, which I think is a reasonable estimate. If underlying core PCE inflation were to continue at its estimated 12-month pace of 2.7 percent in March, that would mean inflation could reach a peak close to 5 percent on an annualized basis in coming months if businesses quickly and completely passed through the cost of the tariff. Even if the tariffs were only partially passed on to consumers, inflation could move up to around 4 percent. These outcomes would obviously be a reversal of the progress we have made on bringing inflation down over the past few years.\nIt will be important to watch inflation expectations and make sure they remain anchored during this process. Surveys of consumers have shown big increases in inflation expectations for this year. However, I tend to discount survey-based measures of inflation and prefer those based on the spread between nominal and inflation-indexed securities, since investors have more skin in the game than survey respondents. These market-based measures have not increased significantly, which implies market participants view tariffs as a one-time change to the price level. So I don't think expectations have become unanchored.\nThere are other factors that may limit the increase in inflation. I continue to believe that monetary policy is meaningfully restricting economic activity and hope that underlying inflation may moderate over the course of the year, separate from the tariff effects. Also, competitive forces, including the desire to hold on to customers, may induce businesses to pass along only a fraction of higher costs from tariffs. Finally, if the economy slows substantially, then weaker demand will put downward pressure on inflation after tariffs take effect.\nIn terms of output growth, with large tariff increases, I would expect the U.S. economy to slow significantly later this year and this slower pace to continue into next year. Higher prices from tariffs would reduce spending, and uncertainty about the pace of spending would deter business investment. I have heard this repeatedly from business contacts around the country\u00e2\u0080\u0094tariff uncertainty is freezing capital spending. Productivity growth, an important source of GDP increases in recent years, would slow as investment is allocated according to trade policy and not towards its most productive and profitable uses. A fall in productivity would likely lower estimates of the neutral policy rate, making the current policy rate more restrictive than it is currently. Any trade retaliation from U.S. trading partners would reduce U.S. exports, which would be a drag on growth. There is a long list of factors that can lower growth in this scenario.\nAlong with slower economic growth would come higher unemployment. With large tariffs remaining in place, I expect the unemployment rate, which was 4.2 percent in March, would rise by several tenths of a percentage point this year and approach 5 percent next year. Even as the economy has moderated over the past year, the unemployment rate has stayed remarkably stable and close to estimates of its long-term rate\u00e2\u0080\u0094in other words, close to the FOMC's goal. But a verifiable fact about the unemployment rate, based on history, is that when it starts to rise, as I expect it would under this scenario, it often rises significantly.\nIn summary, under the large tariff scenario, economic growth is likely to slow to a crawl and significantly raise the unemployment rate. I do expect inflation to rise significantly, but if inflation expectations remain well anchored, I also expect inflation to return to a more moderate level in 2026. Inflation could rise starting in a few months and then move back down toward our target possibly as early as by the end of this year.\nYes, I am saying that I expect that elevated inflation would be temporary, and \"temporary\" is another word for \"transitory.\" Despite the fact that the last surge of inflation beginning in 2021 lasted longer than I and other policymakers initially expected, my best judgment is that higher inflation from tariffs will be temporary. If this inflation is temporary, I can look through it and determine policy based on the underlying trend. I can hear the howls already that this must b",

Barr\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, San Francisco, California\nShare\nWatch Live\nGood morning and thank you to the conference organizers for having me here today.\n1\nIt's great to see such a diverse audience of fintech innovators, bankers, fellow regulators, and students. We all play a part in fostering responsible innovation. Responsible innovation requires a few things\u00e2\u0080\u0094having the optimism and curiosity to understand the potential benefits, the rigor and realism to identify the attendant risks, and the collective intent to find solutions to advance a safe and fair financial system.\nToday, I'd like to speak about responsible innovation in the context of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) in banking and how bank\u00e2\u0080\u0093fintech partnerships may accelerate the integration of the technology and banking. Earlier this year, I laid out two scenarios for Gen AI adoption\u00e2\u0080\u0094an incremental scenario where the technology primarily augments what humans do today, and a transformative scenario where we extend human capabilities with far-reaching consequences.\n2\nOf course, these are hypotheticals, and elements of both scenarios will likely come to pass. But in either scenario, we should anticipate widespread productivity gains, particularly for banking.\n3\nToday, banks appear to be moving cautiously with their Gen AI use, which reflects the current state of the technology, as well as banks' internal organizational structure and the highly regulated environment in which they operate. At the same time, Gen-AI offers enormous potential to significantly alter the business of banking, provided that the risks are managed appropriately. Given rapid advances in Gen AI every quarter, in the not-too-distant future, we may approach a point at which Gen AI becomes an imperative\u00e2\u0080\u0094a competitive necessity\u00e2\u0080\u0094in banking. To prepare for that point, it is useful for regulators and banks to think about the channels through which this competitive necessity may arise. Today, I want to focus on one of those channels, and that's the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0093fintech relationship. Fintechs are well positioned to integrate Gen AI into their products and services, and banks have valuable data on customer behavior on which the Gen AI models can be optimized. Given these synergies, competition and cooperation between banks and fintechs will likely spur innovation and accelerate the integration of Gen AI into banking.\nGen AI may have benefits for consumers and businesses through better, cheaper, and faster financial services; however, to harness the upsides of Gen AI, banks, fintechs, and regulators all have a role to play in helping to ensure that the risks are managed.\nGen AI and Banking\nLet me begin with why Gen AI has such potential for the banking industry. The business of banking is data-driven\u00e2\u0080\u0094data underpin the decisions to set yields on deposits, underwrite and price credit products, and manage the attendant risks. While traditional forms of artificial intelligence have become essential in areas like fraud detection, Gen AI offers new possibilities for data analysis, taking into account a broader and more diverse set of data. Gen AI has benefits for document analysis, which could be applied to improve credit underwriting.\nBeyond data processing and analytics, Gen AI-powered chatbots are already helping assist in customer service. While we still breathe a sigh of relief when we connect to a real customer service representative, this paradigm may change\u00e2\u0080\u0094Gen AI has the potential to enable such high-quality and efficient customer engagement and correct answers that customers may come to prefer Gen AI agents to people. Gen AI chatbots can break down complex tasks into component parts, split up tasks between several AI agents, and help customers make informed decisions. They can also replicate the human touch\u00e2\u0080\u0094adapting to the level of sophistication of their customers, anticipating the customer's needs, and being empathetic to the customer's experience\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps better than some humans.\n4\nAnd moving to trading and capital markets, Gen AI-based analytic tools can build on existing algorithmic trading capabilities by harnessing an enormous knowledge base in both the public and private domains. These enhancements have the potential to enable decisions that are faster and more informed\u00e2\u0080\u0094although with some attendant risks as I've discussed previously.\n5\nWhy Not Yet?\nGiven the potential for Gen AI to enhance banking, why do we not see widespread integration of Gen AI enhanced products and services in banking to date? There are several factors contributing to our current state. Let me highlight some key reasons.\nOf course, one reason is that banks are being appropriately cautious in the highly regulated environment in which they operate. Beyond that, for some of these applications, the technology is not fully mature. For instance, Gen AI systems may still hallucinate, generating plausible sounding but inaccurate information. Relatedly, because Gen AI usually involves stochastic processes, answers can differ in response to the same query asked at different times or to similar queries. This is tough to square with the requirements of banking, where decisions must be well-controlled, numerically and legally precise, explainable, and replicable.\nInformation security is another key concern. To the extent that a Gen AI-powered agent is accessing sensitive customer data and authorizing transactions, it becomes an attractive target for malicious actors.\n6\nFurther, as Gen AI models process vast amounts of data, there's a risk that proprietary or customer information could be inadvertently included in the model's outputs or responses, leading to legal violations and privacy breaches.\nMoreover, business processes at banks have not evolved to optimize Gen AI usage. Gen AI requires data and infrastructure to be effective. Many banks have existing tech debt, and their data storage is siloed and not optimized for firmwide analysis. Furthermore, there may be organizational practices that may make it hard to evolve existing processes to ones optimized by AI.\nThe technological and organizational limitations are real. Nevertheless, I think it may be only a matter of time before the technology advances so that these are engineering, product design, and risk management challenges\u00e2\u0080\u0094rather than insurmountable problems. And with regard to the business process issues, I think fintechs have a real role to play in helping to accelerate responsible innovation by banks in this space.\nFeatures of Fintechs and Banks\nAs Gen AI technology continues to develop, there's a good chance that fintechs will help drive widespread Gen AI adoption in financial services. There are a few reasons why this may be the case. First, fintechs are generally young companies with a clean tech stack and don't have to integrate new technology into old infrastructure. This allows them to make the most of their data and continuously integrate the latest AI capabilities. Second, these firms have financial and time constraints. Early funding rounds provide limited time and resources to demonstrate outcomes and drive fintechs to find effective, quick solutions, which often involve creative uses of cutting-edge technology. Third, because fintechs usually start as a simple business idea and focus on moving one product to production, they can optimize their tech stack for a single outcome instead of balancing the interests of competing business lines.\nThese attributes of fintechs can make them symbiotic with banks. Banks have deep customer data, and data are a key input to effective application of machine learning models, including large language models. Banks are also able to look across a range of business lines and use Gen AI to customize integrated sales strategies, and they have the scale to adopt global Gen AI solutions for compliance and risk management. And banks have existing customer relationships and mature control frameworks that form the basis of their credibility and trust.\nAnother way to consider the relationship of fintechs and banks is as a race between speed and scale. Fintechs have the ability to operate at speed but start with no scale. Banks, on the other hand, move more slowly but have scale in terms of investment, consumer reach, and risk management. This creates the dynamic where fintechs must attempt to scale their market share quickly enough to overcome the scale and incumbent advantage of the banks.\n7\nBank\u00e2\u0080\u0093Fintech Relationship as an Accelerant for AI Adoption\nAnd this leads me to my next point\u00e2\u0080\u0094I believe that the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0093fintech relationship has the potential to accelerate adoption of Gen AI in financial services. This may come in the form of direct competition, with fintechs taking market share from banks for certain products, or banks crowding out fintechs by introducing better technology into their existing or new product lines. Such competition usually benefits consumers by providing more choice and better and cheaper products, provided that the risks are appropriately managed. It may also create competitive pressure and consumer demand that pushes banks to adopt Gen AI products and solutions more quickly.\nAlternatively, fintechs and banks may enter into a symbiotic relationship, forming collaborative partnerships where fintechs and banks merge their strengths. Examples of these partnerships may include banks purchasing or investing capital in fintechs with Gen AI products, or banks and fintechs entering into traditional vendor\u00e2\u0080\u0093client relationships.\nResponsibility for AI Risk Management\nThere's one common theme in these scenarios: technology advances outside of the bank perimeter and rapidly enters the regulated sector. To get prepared for this moment, bank risk managers and regulators should become familiar with Gen AI trends and monitor developments outside the bank perimeter so that they are not caught off guard as this technology quickly enters the banking system.\nWe have a shared role in creating the incentive structure to appropriately manage risks. To the extent banks are using Gen AI or offering Gen AI products and services, they have the responsibility to manage their risk, and should use their relationships to incentivize good risk management practices for fintechs.\n8\nThis means choosing fintech partners that provide transparency and clarity regarding the development of AI tools and have demonstrated appropriate control in deployment. There's necessary tension here, as banks must understand the tools offered by their fintech partners for their own risk management, while fintechs may not want to share details they hold close\u00e2\u0080\u0094their secret sauce. With respect to Gen AI, it is important for fintechs and banks to tackle questions like who owns the customer data, and potential conflicts that may arise if a bank's customer data are fed back into a fintech's Gen AI model.\nFintechs also have an important role to play in laying the groundwork for good risk management of Gen AI.\n9\nAs I've mentioned before, data quality and model training are critical to safe, sound, and fair use of these tools.\n10\nFintech developers should, for example, prioritize identifying biases in training data sets and monitoring outputs in order to prevent those biases from amplifying inequalities or mispricing risks. Moreover, fintechs should be aware of how banks manage risk, so that the fintech can adapt Gen AI solutions to be compatible with sound risk management approaches.\nAnd what should regulators do? As I've mentioned, regulators need to stay educated and informed on the technology, so that they understand the business case for deploying the technology and the attendant risks. They should review and update existing standards on model risk management, as appropriate, and engage in public\u00e2\u0080\u0093private forums where there are opportunities to work together. And they need to explore how and when to deploy the technology themselves, to remain in touch in the changing world and make reasoned judgments about how to supervise the use of Gen AI in the banking sector.\nThese changes will require broad-based curiosity from regulators, fintechs, and banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094combined with education and investment\u00e2\u0080\u0094to create a culture of awareness on the opportunity and risks of the technology. Equally as important is leadership, to establish appropriate governance over AI and provide appropriate direction on priorities.\nConclusion\nIn closing, successful integration of Gen AI into banking will require both creativity in adoption as well as getting the guardrails right. That's not a zero-sum game. It's an opportunity for all stakeholders\u00e2\u0080\u0094banks, fintechs, regulators, and consumers\u00e2\u0080\u0094to help to set the foundation for the benefits of the technology to be achieved and the risks to be effectively managed. In this way, we can help to be part of the sound and resilient financial system for all. Thank you.\n1.

Powell\nAt the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing Annual Conference, Arlington, Virginia\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for having me here today. Monetary policy is more effective when the public understands what we are doing and why. Through your work, journalists like you help promote that greater understanding. I am sure this room full of reporters does not lack for questions to ask. Before addressing a few of those, I will briefly summarize the outlook for the economy and monetary policy.\nAt the Fed, we are squarely focused on achieving the dual-mandate goals Congress has given us of maximum employment and stable prices. While uncertainty is high and downside risks have risen, the economy is still in a good place. The incoming data show solid growth, a labor market in balance, and inflation running much closer to, but still above, our 2 percent objective.\nRecent Economic Data\nAfter a couple of years of solid growth, many forecasters have anticipated somewhat slower growth this year. The initial reading for first-quarter GDP will be released later this month. The limited hard data are consistent with a slower but still solid growth outlook. At the same time, surveys of households and businesses report dimming expectations and higher uncertainty about the outlook. Survey respondents point to the effects of new federal policies, especially related to trade. We are closely watching this tension between the hard and soft data. As the new policies and their likely economic effects become clearer, we will have a better sense of their implications for the economy and for monetary policy.\nLooking across many indicators, the labor market appears to be broadly in balance and is not a significant source of inflationary pressure. This morning's jobs report shows the unemployment rate at 4.2\npercent in March, still in the low range where it has held since early last year. Over the first quarter, payrolls grew by an average of 150,000\njobs a month. The combination of low layoffs, moderating job growth, and slowing labor force growth has kept the unemployment rate broadly stable.\nTurning to the other leg of our dual mandate, inflation has declined sharply from its pandemic highs of mid-2022. It has done so without the kind of painful rise in unemployment that has often accompanied periods of tight monetary policy that are needed to reduce inflation. More recently, progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective has slowed. Total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February. Core PCE prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose 2.8 percent. Looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters. Reflecting this, both survey- and market-based measures of near-term inflation expectations have moved up. By most measures, longer-term inflation expectations\u00e2\u0080\u0094those beyond the next few years\u00e2\u0080\u0094remain well anchored and consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. We remain committed to returning inflation sustainably to our 2 percent objective.\nMonetary Policy\nTurning to monetary policy, we face a highly uncertain outlook with elevated risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation. The new Administration is in the process of implementing substantial policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. Our monetary policy stance is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties we face as we gain a better understanding of the policy changes and their likely effects on the economy. It is not our role to comment on those policies. Rather, we make an assessment of their likely effects, observe the behavior of the economy, and set monetary policy in a way that best achieves our dual-mandate goals.\nWe have stressed that it will be very difficult to assess the likely economic effects of higher tariffs until there is greater certainty about the details, such as what will be tariffed, at what level and for what duration, and the extent of retaliation from our trading partners. While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected. The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth. The size and duration of these effects remain uncertain. While tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation, it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome would depend on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, on the size of the effects, and on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices. Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.\nWe will continue to carefully monitor the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance. It is too soon to say what will be the appropriate path for monetary policy.\nConclusion\nWe understand the benefits of a solid economy where workers can find jobs and inflation is low and predictable. We also understand that elevated levels of unemployment or inflation can be damaging and painful for communities, families, and businesses. That is why we at the Fed will continue to do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            April 04, 2025",

Cook\nAt the 2025 McKay Lecture, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nShare\nThank you, Dr. Ripoll. It is wonderful to be here at the University of Pittsburgh. I am honored to deliver the 2025 McKay Lecture in memory of Dr. Marion McKay, who led the economics department here for more than 30 years. I am especially humbled to have this opportunity, given the many significant contributors to the field of economics who have spoken in this series, including David Autor, Claudia Goldin, Bob Lucas, and Joe Stiglitz.\n1\nTitle slide\nI have been looking forward to this lecture for many months, because researching, discussing, and teaching economics have long been my favorite activities. I have been a professor for much longer than I have been a member of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, which I joined three years ago. Today, I would like to discuss my outlook for the economy and my views on the path of monetary policy. For this speech, I will also offer recent historical context about how the economy arrived in its current position, take some time to review some concepts in economics, and, finally, discuss my approach to monetary policy at a time of increasing uncertainty.\nOver the past few years, the U.S. economy has grown at a strong pace, supported by resilient consumer spending. Currently, I see the economy as being in a solid position, though American households, businesses, and investors are reporting heightened levels of uncertainty about both the direction of government policy and the economy. For instance, the Beige Book, a Fed report that compiles anecdotal information on economic conditions gathered from around the country, had 45 mentions of \"uncertainty.\" That is the largest number of mentions of the word in the history of the Beige Book, up from 12 mentions a year ago. Consistent with elevated uncertainty, there are increasing signs that consumer spending and business investment are slowing. Inflation has come down considerably from its peak in 2022 but remains somewhat above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. The labor market appears to have stabilized, and there is a rough balance between available workers and the demand for labor. The unemployment rate remains low by historical standards.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed's primary body for making monetary policy, raised interest rates sharply in 2022 and 2023 in response to elevated inflation. Then, amid progress on disinflation and a rebalancing labor market, last year my FOMC colleagues and I voted to make policy somewhat less restrictive. At our past two policy meetings, we held rates steady at 4.25 to 4.5 percent. Looking ahead, monetary policy will need to navigate the high degree of uncertainty about the economic outlook.\nStructure for Policymaking\nI will discuss the elements of my economic outlook in more detail in a moment. But first let me tell you a bit about how I structure my thinking related to monetary policy and the economy. The starting point for that exercise is always the mandate given to the Federal Reserve by Congress, which has two goals: maximum employment and stable prices. Achieving those goals will result in the best economic outcomes for all Americans.\nSo, when I say \"maximum employment,\" what do I mean? Maximum employment is the highest level of employment, or the lowest level of unemployment, the economy can sustain while maintaining a stable inflation rate. Unemployment has very painful consequences for individual workers and their families, including lower standards of living and greater incidence of poverty. In contrast, maintaining maximum employment for a sustained period results in many benefits and opportunities to families and communities that often had been left behind, including those in rural and urban communities and those with lower levels of education.\nMore broadly, having ample job opportunities typically results in a larger and more prosperous economy. It allows workers, a vital resource in the economy, to be deployed most productively. Maximizing employment promotes business investment and the economy's long-run growth potential. When people can enter the labor force and move to better and more productive positions, it fosters the development of more and better ideas and innovation.\nHow about \"stable prices?\" Like former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan, I consider prices to be stable when shoppers and businesses do not have to worry about costs significantly rising or falling when making plans, such as whether to take out a loan or make an investment.\n2\nSince 2012, the Fed has been explicit about the rate of inflation that constitutes price stability. An inflation rate of 2 percent over the longer run is most consistent with the Fed's price-stability mandate. Price stability means avoiding prolonged periods of high inflation. We know that high inflation is particularly difficult on those who are least able to bear it. Moreover, high inflation may require a forceful monetary policy response, which can lead to bouts of higher unemployment. In contrast, price stability creates the conditions for a sustainable labor market.\nEconomic Developments in the Pandemic Period\nWith the backdrop of the Fed's dual-mandate goals, I would like to discuss the extraordinary developments that have occurred over the past five years, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reviewing that recent history is important context for understanding the current state of monetary policy. Before reviewing the data, it is important to recognize the tragic human suffering and loss of life the pandemic caused. That loss can never be fully described in numbers and charts. For today's discussion, I will describe the economic implications, which were profound and will likely be studied for decades.\nWhen the global pandemic took hold in the spring of 2020, economies around the world shut down or sharply limited activity. This was especially true for in-person services, such as travel, dining out at restaurants, and trips to the barber shop or hair salon. I would like to turn your attention to the screen, where I will display some charts to better illustrate economic developments. In\nfigure 1\n, you can see the sharp downturn in economic growth, followed by the subsequent recovery. At this time, it also became apparent that the economic effects of shutdowns in one part of the world were exacerbated by constrained supplies from other parts of the world. Global policymakers faced the common challenge of supporting incomes and limiting the negative effects of shutdowns, which, mercifully, were temporary. The initial policy response was largely uniform across developed economies. This generally included fiscal support from governments, particularly to help those most in need, although the magnitude differed across countries. Central banks set monetary policy with the aim to prevent a sharp financial and economic deterioration. Later, central banks extended accommodative policy to support the economic recovery. The Federal Reserve, specifically, cut its policy rate in the spring of 2020 to near zero and bought assets to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and to foster accommodative financial conditions. Establishing a low interest rate is intended to support spending and investment.\nAt the onset of the pandemic, a very deep but short contraction of economic activity occurred. Millions of Americans lost their jobs, tens of thousands of school districts sent students and teachers home, factories closed because of outbreaks, and the supply of many goods was disrupted. People also adjusted consumption patterns, rotating toward purchases of goods. Americans who canceled vacation plans and gym memberships sought to buy televisions, exercise equipment, and other goods. Demand for goods rose rapidly, but supply chains were unable to adjust at the same speed. This contributed to a global surge in inflation. That surge was followed by a further upswing in prices after February 2022, when Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused a shock to global supplies of commodities, including food and energy.\nAt the start of 2022, inflation topped 6 percent, and by the middle of that year it reached a peak above 7 percent.\n3\nWith inflation unacceptably high, Fed policymakers turned toward tightening. Take a look at\nfigure 2\n. You can see that from March 2022 to July 2023, the Fed raised its policy rate 5\u00e2\u0080\u00911/4 percentage points. Those higher interest rates helped restrain aggregate demand, and the forceful response helped keep long-term inflation expectations well anchored.\nThe Fed's policy actions occurred alongside increases in aggregate supply. Global trade flows recovered from disruptions, and the availability of manufacturing inputs returned to pre-pandemic levels. U.S. labor supply recovered significantly in 2022 and 2023, boosted by rebounds in labor force participation and immigration.\nFigure 3\nshows the rebound in labor force participation. Notice that workers aged 25 to 54, the dark orange line, led that gain. In response to rising rents, construction of multifamily housing picked up, helping counter shortages of available homes in some areas. The combination of increased supply and policy restraint contributed to a significant slowing of inflation. Notably, inflation came down without a painful increase in unemployment. This was a historically unusual, but most welcome, result.\nProductivity Gains\nIn addition to increased supply and policy restraint, another factor allowed the U.S. economy to grow in recent years as inflation abated\u00e2\u0080\u0094a resurgence in productivity growth. Let's look at\nfigure 4\n. Data through the end of last year indicate that labor productivity has grown at a 2 percent annual rate since the end of 2019, surpassing its 1.5 percent growth rate over the previous 12 years. As a result, the level of productivity, the blue line, has been higher than expected given the pre-pandemic trend, the dashed orange line.\nSeveral forces likely supported productivity in recent years. New business formation in the U.S. has risen since the start of the pandemic. These newer firms are more likely to innovate and adopt new technologies and business processes, and this, in turn, can support productivity gains. As the economy reopened after pandemic shutdowns, workers took new jobs and moved to new locations, and the pace of job switching remained elevated for some time. That reallocation may have resulted in better and more productive matches between the skills of workers and their jobs, thus raising labor productivity.\n4\nLabor shortages during the pandemic recovery also spurred businesses to invest in labor-saving technologies and to improve efficiency, which may have supplied at least a one-time boost to productivity.\nLooking ahead, investment in new technologies may continue to support productivity growth. Much of this investment has gone toward artificial intelligence (AI). As I have discussed in previous speeches, I see AI, and generative AI in particular, as likely to become a general purpose technology, similar to the printing press and computer, that will spread throughout the economy and spark downstream innovation as well as continue to improve over time.\n5\nIt holds the promise to increase the pace of idea generation, and each newly discovered idea could itself provide an incremental boost to productivity. In the longer run, I am optimistic about the potential for gains in total factor productivity growth from the growing integration of AI into business processes throughout the economy.\nEconomic Outlook\nNow that I have reviewed the path of the economy over the past five years, I would like to present my near-term outlook for the economy in more detail. In the past year, overall economic activity and the labor market have been solid, while inflation has run somewhat above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.\nInflation\nI will start with inflation, which you can see in\nfigure 5\n. The most recent data show that inflation was 2.5 percent for the 12 months ending in February, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, shown in blue. This is a marked shift down from the peak of 7.2 percent in June 2022. The dark orange line shows that core PCE prices\u00e2\u0080\u0094which exclude the volatile food and energy categories\u00e2\u0080\u0094increased 2.8 percent in February, down from a peak of 5.6 percent in February 2022. Economists pay careful attention to core prices, as they are typically a better indicator of underlying inflation and the path of future inflation.\nWhile the progress since 2022 has been notable, the decline in inflation over the past year has been slow and uneven. Prices for energy, including gasoline, have moderated. Food inflation has mostly stabilized over the past year, but it is still elevated for some grocery items. Let's look at the components of core inflation in\nfigure 6\n. You can see that housing services inflation, the dashed green line, remains high but has moderated steadily over the past two years, consistent with the past slowing in market rents.\nSince we are talking about housing and the cost of renting, let me say a word about the data we use at the Federal Reserve. Most of the data I have presented thus far are carefully collected, analyzed, and released by federal government agencies, like the Bureau of Economic Analysis which collects data on GDP. But we use a wide variety of sources, including series generated by the private sector. Market rents\u00e2\u0080\u0094the cost many of you pay for your apartment\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a good example. Where do you think we get information on rents? From some of the same websites you would use to find an apartment. We use high-frequency data series from sources like those as inputs into a model of rents on new leases in real time. This turns out to be helpful in the timely determination of where rents are, because they show up with a lag in official measures of inflation.\nGoing back to figure 6, outside of housing, core services inflation, the dark orange line, has eased only a bit over the past year, held up by persistent inflation in restaurant meals, airline fares, and financial fees. Notably, goods prices outside of food and energy, the blue line, have increased recently after a period of decline associated with the resolution of pandemic-related supply disruptions. The recent rise in core goods prices may partly reflect sellers' anticipation that tariff increases could raise the cost of supplies.\nTariff increases typically result in an increase in the level of prices for the affected goods, which temporarily pushes up the overall inflation rate. But what matters for monetary policy would be a persistent boost to inflation. I am carefully wa",

Jefferson\nAt \u00e2\u0080\u009cFinancial Intermediaries, Markets, and Monetary Policy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the University of Virginia Darden School of Business, Atlanta, Georgia\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Dr. Tkac, for your kind words and for the opportunity to talk to this group.\n1\nIt is always wonderful to be back in Georgia and here at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. And it is an honor to speak at a conference co-organized by the University of Virginia, where I received my Ph.D.\nTitle Slide\nYou have heard already today about financial markets and the banking system. To add to that picture, I would like to share with you my outlook for the U.S. economy and my views of appropriate monetary policy. But before that, I want to touch on the importance of central bank communications, and particularly the evolution of Fed communications.\nThe Value of Communications\nOne of the reasons I so appreciate the opportunity to speak at events like this is because speeches are an important part of how the Federal Reserve delivers on its mission to the American people. Like my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), I enjoy engaging regularly with people from around the country to hear about on-the-ground economic conditions and to learn specifics about industries and communities. Such engagement is also a pathway to delivering better policy. It is important that households, businesses, and financial markets understand policymakers' views and assessments of economic conditions.\nMonetary policy is transmitted to the rest of the economy through financial market prices, such as long-term interest rates, which in turn affect the decisions of households and businesses. Changes in the target range for the federal funds rate are transmitted to short-term interest rates through arbitrage relationships. Short-term interest rates and central bank communication, in turn, affect long-term interest rates through investors' expectations. According to the expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates, intermediate- and long-term interest rates are the weighted average of expected future short-term interest rates. In addition, monetary policy affects risk premiums. Tighter monetary policy tends to reduce the willingness of investors to bear risk, making them less willing to invest in long-term assets, which means that their return should be higher for investors to buy these assets.\nFormer Fed Chair Ben Bernanke nicely summarized how important central bank communication is for the transmission of monetary policy by saying that \"monetary policy is 98 percent talk and only two percent action.\"\n2\nWhile obviously hyperbole, the point is meaningful. Clear communication is an important part of a Fed policymaker's job.\nToday the Fed communicates in a variety of ways, including policymaker speeches, Chair Powell's press conferences, and even through the Fed's social media channels. Clear and ample communication, however, has not always been the hallmark of the Fed. In the 1990s, cable news outlets would attempt to spot former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan walking into the building on the day of FOMC meetings. Commentators would pay careful attention to the size of his briefcase.\n3\nThe thought was that if the Chair was advocating a rate change, the briefcase would be bulging with documents to convince fellow policymakers. A light bag, on the contrary, would have signaled that a\nstatus quo\npolicy decision was likely. Former Chair Greenspan seemed to value the element of surprise. In 1987, he famously quipped, \"If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.\"\n4\nThat said, during his tenure in later years, he initiated substantial changes in how Fed policymakers communicate with the public.\nFigure 1\nshows a timeline of the steps taken toward increasing transparency at the Fed since the 1990s. Beginning in 1993, the Fed started to publish FOMC meeting minutes in their current form at the next meeting. Soon after that, the Committee began releasing full transcripts of what was said at the meetings with a five-year lag. The next year, the FOMC started to issue statements following meetings at which there was a change in the policy stance. Before such public statements, Fed watchers would need to observe movements in markets to determine if a policy change was being implemented. In subsequent years, the target federal funds rate was incorporated into these statements, and then, in 1999, the FOMC started to publish statements after every meeting, regardless of whether there was a policy change. In 2004, the FOMC accelerated the release of the minutes to three weeks after the meeting. The Fed's transparency increased further under former Chair Bernanke. In November 2007, the FOMC began releasing the Summary of Economic Projections, commonly known as the SEP, which, as you may know, is a compilation of individual policymakers' forecasts for output, unemployment, and inflation. Since 2012, the SEP has also included information about policymakers' projections of appropriate monetary policy, known as the dot plot. Former Chair Bernanke started holding press conferences after every other FOMC meeting in 2011. In 2012, the FOMC published the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is known as the consensus statement. That statement articulates the FOMC's framework for the conduct of monetary policy in pursuit of the dual-mandate goals assigned by Congress: maximum employment and price stability. And since then, the FOMC has undertaken periodic public reviews of that statement. Under Chair Powell's tenure, starting in 2019, the Chair's press conferences have been held after every FOMC meeting.\nOf course, the Chair and other policymakers also regularly testify before Congress, as required by law. And the Fed releases many reports and data, including the\nMonetary Policy Report,\nthe\nFinancial Stability Report,\nand the\nSupervision and Regulation Report.\nPolicymakers' public appearances also help inform the public about the Fed's goals and its strategies to achieve those goals.\nCommunication is not just about talking; it is also about listening. Policymakers listen to the steady beat of economic data, and the Board and the Reserve Banks conduct numerous surveys of financial market participants, businesses, and families. Some of what we hear is summarized in the Beige Book, published eight times per year. I also listen to experts and the public at events like this and\nFed Listens\nevents, several of which are planned for later this year.\nToday, it is widely accepted that clear communication contributes greatly to effective transmission of monetary policy, especially because clear communication can affect the expected path of interest rates and financial conditions more generally. Former Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester studied this issue closely and discussed that when policymakers are clear about their policy goals, aspects of the economy that can and cannot be influenced by monetary policy, and the economic information that influences their forecasts and policy decisions, the public will have a better understanding of monetary policy.\n5\nThe public can then incorporate that information into their saving, borrowing, employment, and investment decisions.\nEconomic Outlook\nSo, in that spirit of making sure the public is well informed, I will now share with you my outlook for the U.S. economy. Over the past two years, significant progress has been made toward the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. Labor market conditions are solid, and inflation has come down, though it remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent goal. While the economy is in a solid position, surveys of consumers and businesses show heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook. It remains to be seen what these surveys imply about future spending and investment and the direction of the economy more broadly.\nEconomic Activity\nThe economy expanded at a solid pace at the end of last year with gross domestic product (GDP) rising at a 2.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, extending a period of steady growth, as you can see in\nfigure 2\n. While Fed policymakers and many private-sector forecasters expect growth to continue, they broadly anticipate a slower pace of expansion this year. In the SEP released after the March FOMC meeting, the median participant projected GDP to rise 1.7 percent this year and to move up a bit below 2 percent over the next two years.\nResilient consumer spending has been the driving force of the current economic expansion. More recently, a few signs have emerged that suggest that some of the factors supporting last year's strong spending growth may be weakening. As you can see in\nfigure 3\n, retail and food service sales rose 0.2 percent in February after falling a sharp 1.2 percent in January. That slower pace of spending could reflect seasonality, poor weather, and expected cooling after the strong spending at the end of last year. Nonetheless, the readings at the start of this year suggest less support for growth from household spending in the first quarter. The most recent Beige Book stated that contacts reported consumer spending was lower, on balance, with still solid demand for essential goods but increased price sensitivity for discretionary items, particularly among lower-income shoppers.\n6\nIndustrial production has increased for three straight months, including a 0.7 percent advance in February, which was led by a rise in manufacturing output, particularly motor vehicles. Like consumer sentiment, however, readings on business sentiment have also slipped. The Beige Book reported some increases in manufacturing activity, though it noted concerns raised by firms, including chemical products and office equipment makers, about the potential effect of changes to trade policy. Some manufacturing contacts in this region, the Sixth District, said that they expected demand to improve over the next 12 months but also noted risks around policy changes and global uncertainty.\nIf uncertainty persists or worsens, economic activity may be constrained. An important lesson learned in recent years, however, is that American consumers have been resilient, and negative sentiment reported in surveys often does not translate into a slowdown in actual activity.\nLabor Market\nWith respect to the labor market, conditions remain solid. The unemployment rate has remained low and was 4.1 percent in February. As you can see in\nfigure 4\n, it has remained in a narrow range for the past year, consistent with broader evidence that labor market conditions have stabilized. That said, I anticipate that there could be some modest softening in the labor market this year. In the SEP projections, the median FOMC participant expected the unemployment rate to be 4.4 percent at the end of this year and 4.3 percent over the next two years.\nPayroll job gains have averaged nearly 200,000 per month over the past six months, through February. We will, of course, get additional data tomorrow with the March jobs report. The pace of job gains has cooled from its post-pandemic peak, but layoffs remain low.\nFigure 5\nshows that new applications for unemployment benefits are largely holding steady this year and running at rates consistent with pre-pandemic levels. Low layoffs are a reason why the unemployment rate has been steady even as hiring has moderated. Recently, there has been an increase in former federal government employees seeking unemployment benefits and some uptick in claims filings in certain regions affected by those layoffs. I will be monitoring incoming data closely and remain vigilant about potential spillover effects in sectors such as education, health care, and state governments.\nLooking at\nfigure 6\n, you see that the gap between job openings and unemployed people seeking work has held steady for several months. That is another sign that the labor market is well-balanced. The gap has significantly narrowed from a peak in 2022, when the labor market was overheated. It is now consistent with 2019 readings, when the labor market was also solid and inflation low. Wages are growing faster than inflation and at a more sustainable pace than earlier in the pandemic recovery. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.\nInflation\nInflation has come down a great deal over the past two and a half years but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent objective. Looking at inflation shown in\nfigure 7\n, you see that the 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index peaked at 7.2 percent in June 2022. Since then, it has come down on an uneven path. In February, overall inflation was 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis. Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, shown by the dashed red line, peaked at 5.6 percent in 2022. In February, it was 2.8 percent.\nWhile inflation is well down from its recent peak, the latest data have largely shown it moving sideways. The median FOMC participant forecasts overall PCE inflation at 2.7\u00e2\u0080\u00afpercent this year and 2.2 percent next year. In 2027, the median projection is at our 2\u00e2\u0080\u00afpercent objective. The prospect of tariffs has consumers and businesses reporting that they expect higher inflation in the near term. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.\nTo better understand what is driving inflation, I think it can be helpful to look at some major components of changes in prices, as you can see in\nfigure 8\n. Outside of food and energy, goods inflation was negative last year, helping to support overall disinflation. In more recent months, goods inflation has turned positive. That may in part reflect trade policy or the anticipation of changes to trade policy, but capturing the exact cause is difficult. Services inflation excluding housing, the dashed red line, has moderated from its peak but remains elevated. Housing services inflation, the dotted purple line, continues to move lower. If that trend continues, it could counter somewhat stronger inflation in other categories.\nMonetary Policy\nIn the current environment, I attach a higher degree of uncertainty to my projections than usual. The most recent SEP indicated that other FOMC participants also were quite uncertain about the outlook: A greater number of participants indicated that uncertainty around their projections of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation was higher than average over the past 20 years compared with responses from the previous",

Kugler\nAt \u00e2\u0080\u009cPublic Talk: Reflections on Recent Economic Developments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cosponsored by the Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies and the Julis-Rabinowitz Center for Public Policy and Finance, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Alan, and thank you to the Griswold and Julis-Rabinowitz Centers for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nAs someone who has worked in both the public sector and academia, I applaud the common purpose of both centers in connecting researchers, policymakers, and the private sector to pursue policy ideas that serve the public good.\nSlide 1\nTo that end, I can think of few individuals who have done more\u00e2\u0080\u0094as a teacher, researcher, government official, and public figure\u00e2\u0080\u0094than Alan Blinder. That includes educating the public about economic policymaking. In the spring of 2022, as many wondered whether Russia's war on Ukraine would add to the factors then driving up inflation, Professor Blinder wrote in the\nWall Street Journal\nthat a more important factor would probably be the public's expectations of future inflation.\n2\nAs I will relate in these remarks, he was, of course, absolutely correct. As in the past, inflation expectations have played a crucial role in the course of inflation since the spring of 2022, and I expect they will be important in the Federal Reserve's ongoing effort to achieve sustained inflation of 2 percent. For that reason, I would like to focus on inflation expectations today, before discussing my outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for appropriate monetary policy. First, I will describe inflation expectations within the conceptual framework that many economists use to connect inflation to broader economic activity, known as the Phillips curve. Second, I will discuss the central importance of the stability of these expectations, which we have come to call the \"anchoring\" of inflation expectations. Third, I will explain how firms and households form their inflation expectations and how these expectations affect their economic decisionmaking. Throughout, I will make some references to historical experiences with inflation but focus on the period since the pandemic.\nEconomists have long recognized the connection between inflation and overall macroeconomic conditions, but it was in trying to explain this empirical relationship and measure it with some precision that the importance of inflation expectations was revealed.\nThe foundation of this work was laid by New Zealand economist A.W. Phillips, a fascinating figure who was, among other things, a mechanical genius who built an early economic model operated by hydraulics rather than electronics. In contemplating the mechanics of the economy, in 1958 Phillips set about to explain why nominal wage growth was slower when unemployment was high and faster when unemployment was low. His and other subsequent research showed that a crucial factor was the utilization of resources, such as labor and capital.\n3\nGenerally, when firms use labor and capital very intensively, production costs tend to rise, and firms have more scope to pass those cost increases along in the form of higher prices for their products and services, which, in turn, may push up inflation across the economy. In contrast, when that level of utilization is low, costs tend to rise more slowly (or even fall), and firms have less scope for raising prices, thus pushing down inflation. This tradeoff has been called the Phillips curve.\nIn this simple form, this tradeoff implies that governments can achieve and maintain very low unemployment only if they allow inflation to rise to a certain level. In the latter 1960s, Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps asserted that this orderly tradeoff was only temporary and would ultimately break down because of the role of expectations and, in particular, inflation expectations.\n4\nTo use an example, while current production costs are important to a factory owner setting prices, that owner will also consider future production costs, future levels of demand, and expectations for inflation throughout the economy. Likewise, workers will factor expectations of future economic conditions into their pay demands, and banks will consider future inflation in deciding loan rates. Consumers, whose purchases constitute some two-thirds of economic activity, make decisions about whether to purchase something today with an idea of what it will cost in the future. All these decisions are influenced by expectations, and this is the way in which expectations may shape inflation now. In turn, when we think about the Phillips curve and its tradeoff nowadays, we account for the important role of expectations of different individuals throughout the economy.\nThere are different measures of inflation expectations, some from surveys polling business owners, others asking consumers, and yet others estimating expectations among bond investors based on the differences in yields between nominal and inflation-indexed securities. While most of my points apply broadly to all measures of expectations, my examples come mostly from surveys of consumers and businesses. While there are questions, which I will address, about how well these surveys measure inflation expectations, I closely monitor them because they complement market-based indicators of future inflation that are affected by dynamics intrinsic to financial markets, such as changes in risk premiums.\nLet me note that, in addition to the way expectations of future inflation influence prices in the near term, there are economic mechanisms that link current inflation with\npast\ninflation, such as those that set wages and the terms of rental contracts. In these cases, adjustments in these terms are often benchmarked on past inflation, as, for instance, when workers and landlords aim to recoup losses from increases in general prices. To cite one example, as the economy reopened after the pandemic, workers sought higher wages to compensate for the early wave of inflation in food and core goods, thus further pushing up inflation, especially in the services sector, where labor accounts for the largest share of this sector's costs.\n5\nAnd, because rental agreements typically last for 12 months or more, landlords faced a lag in adjusting rents to reflect the escalation of inflation after the pandemic and sought to recoup those losses when renewing leases.\nBy looking at price changes this way, in a rearview mirror, some decisionmakers in the economy end up making inflation more persistent. That is important to me as an economic policymaker who must pay attention to both expectations of future inflation and the persistence of current inflation.\nWhen we speak of expectations of future inflation, it is crucial to define the time horizon, and different surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve and others ask about inflation from 1 year to as many as 10 years in the future. Surveys with a shorter horizon, such as the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers' question on inflation 1 year ahead, shown in\nfigure 1\n, are heavily influenced by current inflation. Near-term inflation expectations tend to be more volatile, moving up when, for example, energy prices increase, or down when energy or some other volatile set of prices decreases. These expectations are important because many economic decisions, such as major consumer purchases and hiring and investment for firms, focus on horizons of only a few years ahead.\nBy contrast, inflation expectations over longer horizons, such as the Michigan survey's question on inflation during the next 5 to 10 years (the red line in figure 1), say less about current conditions than about the trend for inflation for some time in the future. You can think about these longer-term expectations as much less affected by the forces that push inflation up or down in the short term, what economists call \"shocks.\" Longer-term inflation expectations tend to be less volatile, affected less, for example, by what oil or food prices have done lately than by the stability of inflation over years or decades.\nI mention these different time horizons because they matter in my job as a central banker. Expectations a year from now reflect short-term shocks to the economy, as well as ongoing efforts from monetary policymakers to bring the economy back to its longer-run state. Thus, while short-term expectations may indicate whether inflation is expected to move toward its target, they are not the best gauge of monetary policy credibility. Longer-term inflation expectations, however, should be much less influenced by short-term shocks to the economy, and a change in those expectations has implications for the Federal Reserve's prospects for meeting its price-stability goal.\nWhen these longer-term expectations are reasonably low and unresponsive to shorter-term developments, we say they are \"anchored.\" It is not clear who first defined the term, but Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in 2007 gave a speech on inflation expectations in which he described \"anchored\" expectations as \"relatively insensitive to incoming data.\"\n6\nSo how should we think about the process of anchoring and de-anchoring of inflation expectations? The dynamics of short- and long-term inflation expectations shed light on this issue. If the public experiences a spell of inflation higher than their shorter-run expectations, they will revise up these shorter-term expectations to ensure that their near-term plans account for the change in the economic environment. That's what happened after the pandemic, when inflation based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose to a peak of 7.2 percent and one-year expectations rose to more than 5 percent. But longer-term inflation expectations remained anchored, with values within the range seen since 1995. I would contrast this experience with the United States' previous bout of high inflation from the 1970s to the early 1980s. Among other issues, such as high energy prices and accommodative monetary policy, rising inflation and inflation expectations fed a cycle of escalating inflationary pressures.\n7\nInflation was high and very volatile over this period, and that is reflected in shorter and longer-term inflation expectations that were high and volatile, too.\nAnother important difference between these two episodes has to do with the performance of the Federal Reserve. As opposed to the late 1960s and most of the 1970s, most recently the Fed acted aggressively to tighten monetary policy, raising the federal funds rate more rapidly than in previous tightenings and lowering inflation more quickly than ever before. This came after 30 years of success in keeping inflation in check, and the credibility earned by the Fed's inflation discipline surely helped keep longer-term expectations stable. This shows that an important role of the central bank is to convince the public, through actions and communications, about its intention to shape economic conditions and to use its policy tools to bring inflation to its target.\n8\nBy committing to keep inflation low in the future, central banks seek to influence expectations of future inflation, which, in turn, influence conditions now and over time. The Fed's credibility in keeping inflation low and stable, won over decades, kept longer-term inflation expectations stable, and that contributed significantly to the Fed's success in reducing inflation while keeping the labor market strong.\nThose are some of the basics about inflation expectations and how they influence the economy and the conduct of monetary policy. Next, I want to note some of the patterns we see in survey measures of inflation expectations, what influences expectations, and how inflation expectations are used by the public in their decisionmaking. Fortunately, there is a rich body of economic research that has shed light on these questions, and I will focus on the evidence for households and firms.\n9\nWe can then take some lessons from these empirical patterns for monetary policymaking.\nOne important observation is that both short- and long-term inflation expectations are often notably higher than actual inflation, even after a period of very low inflation. There is evidence that survey respondents often believe the inflation they have experienced is higher than it is. Another pattern is that there is a wide dispersion of views about both shorter and longer-term inflation expectations, reflecting, at least in part, the dispersion of inflation in the consumer baskets of goods and services purchased by different people. Research also finds that some groups, such as women and lower-income households, tend to have systematically higher inflation expectations. In addition to this variation in expectations, there is high uncertainty in forecasts of future inflation. When people are asked to assign probabilities to different forecasts for inflation, surveys report wide distributions in the likelihood of one outcome or another. Finally, short-term inflation expectations tend to be correlated with both recently realized inflation and perceptions about recent inflation.\n10\nThese patterns tell policymakers that inflation expectations of households and firms are diffuse and likely harder to influence through monetary policy relative to financial market participants and professional forecasters who follow the news more closely. Still, expectations from business owners and workers ultimately inform firms' pricing decisions and costs and, thus, may even be more relevant for inflation outcomes; therefore, it is important for policymakers to communicate clearly with the public our intentions to bring inflation back to our target.\n11\nSo, because inflation expectations are diffuse and heavily influenced by recent experience, let's consider the reasons for the dispersion in these expectations. Unsurprisingly, it starts with the considerable variation in the sources that the public uses to collect information about inflation. Households report that their main source of information is their own shopping experiences, making regular purchases such as groceries and gasoline, and the price changes in those goods and services are what affect inflation expectations the most.\n12\nAlso, it seems that inflation expectations of homeowners tend to respond to changes in mortgage rates because homeowners have more of an incentive to track changes in rates that might affect, for example, their prospects for loan refinancing.\n13\nAnother important source of information is energy bills, with evidence also pointing to households' inflation expectations being more sensitive to energy prices when inflation is higher.\n14\nMore generally, consumers and fi",

Kugler\nAt the 2025 U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Legislative Summit, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nThank you, Ramiro, and thank you for the opportunity to speak with all of you today.\n1\nWelcome to Washington, D.C.! Bienvenidos a la capital! I hope you have a productive conference and an enjoyable visit. I am honored to speak with you today because I have long appreciated the efforts of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in supporting Hispanic-owned businesses, especially small businesses and entrepreneurs. It is also gratifying to speak to you today as the first Latin policymaker in the Federal Reserve's history.\nThe support and mentorship from my family and my communities, including many in the Hispanic community, have been foundational to my career. I am proud that I can bring my own perspective and background to how I view the economy and economic data\u00e2\u0080\u0094just as I value learning and hearing from others\u00e2\u0080\u0094because I know the decisions I make can affect the lives of all Americans. As a Fed Governor, I serve all Americans, and I strive to recognize the economic contributions that come from all corners of this country.\nToday, I will talk about the entrepreneurial spirit that many Latinos embody and share with you the importance of Latinos to the whole of the U.S. economy. I will then provide my outlook for the U.S. economy.\nEntrepreneurial Spirit\nLet me start by saying that I have a strong affinity for entrepreneurs and recognize that they are a driving force behind economic growth and job creation\u00e2\u0080\u0094which I know from the data, as I have spent most of my career as a labor economist and researcher. But I truly understand the crucial role they play in the economy because my grandparents and father were entrepreneurs. My maternal grandfather was a dairy farmer, and I still recall the effort and dedication I saw as a child while joining him as he went from store to store selling milk early in the morning\u00e2\u0080\u0094before starting his other job as mayor of the town. And my paternal grandparents owned an electronics shop, where they worked shoulder to shoulder. My grandpa ran the front end of the shop, and my grandma was in charge of the accounting and inventory. The lessons on the value of hard work and taking initiative have stayed with me throughout my career in academia and continue to now in my work as a policymaker. I have always brought an entrepreneurial spirit to everything I do, seeking to be proactive about identifying opportunities and pursuing new or better solutions to long-standing challenges.\nAnd that is exactly what millions of Latino entrepreneurs do across the U.S. every day. There are roughly 5 million Latino-owned businesses that provide jobs to millions of other workers across the country.\n2\nAnd the number of entrepreneurs is growing fast. Between 2007 and 2022, there was a 57 percent increase in the number of Latin-owned businesses, and the number of employees on their collective payrolls grew 1.2 million. As I have emphasized in my past speeches, the growth in new business formation has been critical in sustaining the productivity growth that we have experienced in recent years, which has allowed us to achieve an economic expansion while reducing inflation.\nI see this growth as I travel around the country and meet with workers and business leaders. For example, I noted in a recent speech in Miami that South Florida is an area with a large and vibrant Latino community and is also one of the top regions for new business formation.\n3\nOther data are also consistent with an elevated level of entrepreneurship in our community. Latino adults who did not previously own a business created a new company at nearly twice the national rate in 2023.\n4\nAnd while the overall new entrepreneurship rate edged lower after a pandemic-era jump, the rate for Latino entrepreneurs continued to rise to a new record high in 2023. This growth matters to the U.S. economy. Entrepreneurs improve the way of doing business and generate new jobs and wealth. They often create new processes, products, markets, and services that solve problems and improve the quality of life for many. Entrepreneurs also bring fresh perspectives and contribute to economic progress. For example, a recent survey by the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative shows that Latino-owned businesses outperform others in the adoption of artificial intelligence.\n5\nLatinos in the Economy\nBeyond starting businesses and creating jobs, Latinos are a large and growing part of the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0094as consumers, workers, and investors. Collectively, Latino households generate trillions of dollars in economic activity each year in the U.S. There are 34 million Latino workers in the U.S. labor force, and the median weekly earnings of Latinos working full time has doubled over the past 20 years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those data points suggest that many Latino workers are moving into higher-wage, higher-productivity jobs. Overall, nearly one in every five Americans are of Latino heritage. In some states, such as Texas, that figure is closer to two in five. And given that the Latino population is growing, it is not surprising that Texas also led the country in job creation last year, adding 284,000 jobs to payrolls.\n6\nAcross the U.S., the Latino labor force has grown 14 percent since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, much faster than the about 4 percent growth for the total labor force.\nLatinos tend to work or seek employment at high rates. The Latino labor force participation rate was 66.9 percent in February versus 62.4 percent for the population overall. In addition to filling jobs for employers and meeting consumer demand for goods and services, this labor force growth was a helpful counter to inflation at a time when the labor market was historically tight.\nThe growth in the Latino workforce contributed to the rebalancing of the U.S. labor market in recent years. The labor market has cooled from an overheated state to a stable position characterized by low unemployment and diminished wage pressures. Latino workers especially aided that rebalancing by taking positions that had been difficult for employers to fill. For example, early in the pandemic many Americans remodeled or expanded their homes, where they were suddenly spending much more time. And anyone in this room that undertook such a project in 2021 or 2022 likely remembers how difficult it was to hire carpenters, plumbers, and other workers. Many skilled Latino workers filled that void. As of February, Latinos accounted for 35 percent of all construction workers, up from about 30 percent five years ago. Similarly, Latino workers have outsized representation in several other fields in which hiring has been challenging in recent years. Over one-third of warehouse and storage workers and one-fourth of couriers\u00e2\u0080\u0094both important to the e-commerce industry\u00e2\u0080\u0094are Latino. Latinos also represent a large share of critical childcare, automotive repair, and building maintenance positions\u00e2\u0080\u0094the people that make it possible for everyone to get to work and do their jobs well.\nMoving forward, the young Latino population will continue to contribute to the labor force, as 1 million Latinos every year will turn 18 over the next two decades. And the educational attainment growth of Latinos is three times faster than that of other groups. Already one-fourth of the nation's K\u00e2\u0080\u009312 students are Latino\u00e2\u0080\u0094thus on track to soon contribute to the skilled labor force.\nEconomic Outlook\nOf course, I am always studying how the economy is playing out for Americans of all backgrounds. As such, I would like to share with you my economic outlook before I conclude.\nThe U.S. economy has been on solid footing in recent years. Consistent with that assessment, real gross domestic product grew 2.5 percent last year. The most recent data on economic activity in the early part of this year have shown some signs of softness: Retail sales plunged more than 1 percent in January. However, that slowing was not entirely unexpected after the strong showing in December, some bad weather earlier this year, and the difficulties in the seasonal adjustment of the data. Moreover, growth in retail sales moved back up into positive territory, increasing 0.2 percent in February.\nThe labor market appears to be stable through February. U.S. employers added 151,000 jobs in February and 125,000 in January. The pace of hiring during the first two months of the year is a slowdown compared with the strong gains in November and December, but, again, that could reflect weather disruptions and seasonal adjustment challenges. Over the past six months, employers added a solid average of 190,000 jobs a month. The unemployment rate\u00e2\u0080\u00944.1 percent last month\u00e2\u0080\u0094is low and has remained near its current level since last summer.\nTurning to inflation, I have been keenly aware that price increases have been painful for American families, and I have supported policies intended to bring inflation sustainably back to our 2 percent target. This effort has paid dividends. Inflation has come down a long way from its peak of more than 7 percent in June 2022. Based on the consumer price index and producer price index data for February, it is estimated that the 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was 2.5 percent last month. That is welcome progress, but that progress has slowed since last summer. In certain subcategories there is evidence that inflation reaccelerated in recent months. Importantly, while goods inflation was negative in 2024\u00e2\u0080\u0094as was the norm before the pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u0094it has turned positive in recent months. This development is unhelpful because goods inflation has often kept a lid on total inflation and also affects inflation expectations. In addition to the increase in prices already captured in official data, surveys show that consumers are expecting further increases in the near term. For instance, both short-run and long-run inflation expectations from the Michigan survey have climbed in recent months. According to comments from survey respondents, much of this uncertainty appears to be tied to trade policy. I am paying close attention to the acceleration of price increases and higher inflation expectations, especially given the recent bout of inflation in the past few years. Given the economy's overall solid position and the heightened level of uncertainty, I supported the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision last week to maintain the policy rate at its current level. I see current policy as continuing to be restrictive and I judge that FOMC policy is well positioned. The committee can react to new developments by holding at the current rate for some time as we closely monitor incoming data and the cumulative effects of new policies. I remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal while maintaining a solid labor market. As always, I will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks when considering the appropriate policy rate.\nThank you again for having me here.\n1.

Barr\nAt The Aspen Institute, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nThe United States has an enviable entrepreneurial culture and a strong track record of building new companies. Yet, new and small business owners often navigate significant challenges from establishment to growth. These challenges typically include limitations in accessing capital, in developing robust business and professional networks for peer support and opportunities, and in building the comprehensive skills, resources, and social connections that contribute greatly to business resiliency and sustainability. Women and minority entrepreneurs may face even greater obstacles. While business formation is, of course, primarily a matter for the private sector, public policy can and should encourage increased rates of entrepreneurship and business formation\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the capital, networks, and skills essential for success for all business owners.\nToday, I want to highlight the vital role that small businesses play in driving the U.S. economy, consider the challenges in accessing credit that some small business owners face, and offer some practical solutions to help small businesses thrive.\nSmall Businesses and Their Role in the Economy\nSmall businesses are the heart of the U.S. economy. They produce nearly half of the country's gross domestic product and employ just under half of all private sector workers.\n2\nSmall businesses have created more than 60 percent of net new jobs since 1995, and business applications have remained consistently elevated at around 5 million annually since mid-2020.\n3\nIn recent years, women-owned businesses and minority-owned businesses were two of the fastest-growing segments of businesses. The number of small businesses owned by minorities increased by almost 60 percent and the growth rate for women-owned businesses was not far behind at 50 percent during this time period.\n4\nWe should all be encouraged by these statistics, as several studies suggest that improving business ownership and entrepreneurship across demographic groups would help grow our economy faster.\n5\nAnd from an individual perspective, entrepreneurship and small business ownership may offer meaningful economic advantages. Research suggests that entrepreneurship often correlates with enhanced job satisfaction and improved economic mobility for business owners\u00e2\u0080\u0094though outcomes naturally vary based on multiple factors including market conditions, industry, and individual circumstances.\n6\nAs we recognize the value of small businesses, it's also important to recognize that surviving as a small business is not easy. About one in six new businesses fail during their first year and almost 50% fail by their fifth year.\n7\nWhen a small business struggles or fails, the repercussions often extend beyond the enterprise itself. Entrepreneurs who have invested personal savings and assets in their ventures may face significant financial strain, creating ripple effects that impact their families' stability as well as the broader economic health of their communities.\nIn light of these dynamics, it is essential to understand the fundamental challenges that small businesses face and develop targeted tools and policies that can effectively support entrepreneurs as they start and scale their businesses. Today, let me focus on credit access and the need for more transparency in lending terms.\nAccess to Credit for Small Businesses\nMany small businesses need credit to launch and grow their business. Small businesses access financing from diverse sources, including banks of all sizes, credit unions, online lenders, and other nonbank financing companies. Despite this range of sources, the Federal Reserve's Small Business Credit Survey (SBCS) identified credit availability as a challenge faced by over a quarter of small businesses.\n8\nIn addition, many small businesses face problems with the credit they do obtain.\nWhile access to credit poses challenges for many small businesses, these hurdles can be even more pronounced for women and minority business owners. Research consistently shows that women-owned businesses typically start with smaller amounts of initial capital compared to other firms, even when accounting for factors like education, experience, credit scores, and business characteristics such as industry and growth potential.\n9\nFurthermore, women- and minority-owned businesses often encounter distinct obstacles when seeking financing. Minority business owners often have lower credit scores compared to non-minority business owners, which can lead to lower approval rates for loans.\n10\nBanks, nonbanks, and online lenders have the potential to fill these financing needs. But to be effective, they need to understand consumer preferences and behavior to provide credit products that meet these needs in a safe and fair way.\nAddressing the Need for Financial Transparency\nA significant challenge facing small businesses is the absence of policies providing essential tools and protection for small business borrowers. Despite the fact that many small businesses function more like households than Fortune 500 companies, they generally fall outside regulatory disclosure requirements intended to ensure transparency in pricing, facilitate comparison shopping, and protect the financial interest of borrowers.\nConsider the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), implemented in Regulation Z, which does not extend protection to small business borrowers.\n11\nThis exclusion stems partly from the assumption that small business owners possess financial sophistication or can access professional assistance when needed. This regulatory gap matters because business financing offers may present pricing structures that differ substantially from the standardized disclosures that small business owners are accustomed to seeing on consumer credit disclosures.\nResearch from focus groups conducted by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland revealed that many small business owners struggle with understanding the specialized terminology used by certain nonbank lenders.\n12\nFor instance, instead of providing familiar metrics like an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) or an interest rate, some nonbank providers present a factor rate\u00e2\u0080\u0094a fundamentally different metric that cannot be directly compared to an APR or interest rate. The research identified a lender's website that advertised a \"factor rate of 1.15\" which translated to an undisclosed estimated APR of approximately 70 percent. Further complicating matters, some lenders may disclose an interest rate without including an APR, meaning that various fees and additional costs may not be reflected in the stated rate that borrowers often use to evaluate their financing options.\nWhile complexity sometimes serves a business purpose, in many cases, it obfuscates the costs and can lead to poor financial decisions by small business owners. More broadly, product design by banks and nonbanks should help to counter, not lean into, biases that can lead to poor financial decision-making.\nFor instance, present bias describes our natural tendency to prioritize immediate benefits over long-term considerations. This might lead business owners to focus more on quick access to funds or low initial payments rather than evaluating the complete long-term cost structure. Similarly, status quo bias suggests that once a small business borrower establishes a lending relationship, they may be less inclined to explore alternatives, even when more favorable options become available. The perceived complexity or uncertainty of refinancing or switching lenders can reinforce this tendency to maintain existing arrangements. Understanding psychological factors and cognitive biases can help small business borrowers make more informed financial decisions by recognizing how the presentation of lending terms might affect their evaluation process.\nIn light of these realities, banks, small business advocates, and industry stakeholders should support policies that help small businesses better understand risks, and to drive the market towards products that are designed to overcome, not exacerbate, these problems. Potential policies would include enhancing transparency in loan terms, thus enabling business owners to make more informed financial decisions. Additional borrower safeguards worth consideration include ensuring that loan products are sustainably repayable and don't lead businesses into costly reborrowing cycles, as well as ensuring fair treatment both during the loan origination process and throughout any restructuring efforts or collection proceedings.\nSome states are moving forward with policies that protect small businesses. California and New York, for example, now require many lenders to offer clear disclosure of the APR and estimated monthly payments.\n13\nThis requirement gives borrowers the opportunity to understand the financing being offered in a clear, concise manner, enabling informed comparisons across different product options. Several other states passed versions of disclosure laws for small business financing transactions, with some variability over the range of financing transactions covered and the types of disclosures required.\n14\nThe Role of Community-Based Programs\nI want to recognize the important role that community-based programs can play in supporting entrepreneurs. These programs provide accessible tools, technical assistance, and educational resources that help entrepreneurs reach their full potential. Local organizations such as small business development centers, educational institutions, and community development financial institutions are connecting small business owners with personalized consulting, technical assistance and education, and entrepreneurial skills development.\nThe most successful of these types of programs deliver practical technical assistance and education while fostering collaboration within local entrepreneurial ecosystems. These include university- or community college-based initiatives connecting business owners with volunteer consultants, resource hubs offering workshops, or rural development centers providing specialized support. By emphasizing both skill-building and community connections, these programs help small businesses and entrepreneurs overcome barriers to success.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, small businesses are engines of innovation, job creation, and economic mobility in our society. Great work has been done to understand what it takes to help small businesses thrive and grow, including access to sound and affordable credit, skills-building, and business networks. I encourage us to build on this work by enhancing financial transparency, implementing supportive policies, and leveraging community-based programs to enhance business opportunities. These collective efforts to support entrepreneurs and small business owners not only benefit individual enterprises but also contribute to a healthy and dynamic economy that works for all.\n1.

Waller\nGovernor Christopher J. Waller\nShare\nAt the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I supported no change in the federal funds target range but preferred to continue the current pace of decline in securities holdings.\nReducing the Federal Reserve's balance sheet is an important part of normalizing monetary policy implementation and reducing unneeded reserves in the banking system. Slowing further or stopping redemptions of securities holdings will be appropriate as we get closer to an ample level of reserves. But in my view we are not there yet because reserve balances stand at over $3 trillion and this level is abundant. There is no evidence from money market indicators or my outreach conversations that the banking system is getting close to an ample level of reserves.\nThe Committee slowed the pace of redemptions in June 2024 to help ensure a smooth transition to the appropriate level of securities holdings needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. I believe that pace continues to be the right one.\nIf unanticipated disturbances to reserve demand emerge on the path to balance sheet normalization, the Federal Reserve System has a variety of tools to address such a development. Rather than changing our current pace of balance sheet reduction, the Federal Reserve should rely on those tools and develop a plan for how to respond to short-run strains if they emerge. Such a plan could be implemented swiftly in the event more reserves need to be injected into the banking system. Even with the decision to slow the pace of runoff at this meeting, a plan is still required should a disturbance occur in the future. While this is a procedural matter, good process leads to good outcomes, and good contingency planning helps avoid disruptions to markets and to the FOMC's efforts to achieve our economic objectives.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            March 21, 2025",

Powell\nAt the University of Chicago Booth School of Business 2025 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, New York, New York\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Anil. I appreciate the opportunity to speak at this forum and look forward to our discussion. I will start with some brief remarks about the economy and the path of policy.\nDespite elevated levels of uncertainty, the U.S. economy continues to be in a good place. The labor market is solid, and inflation has moved closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal. At the Federal Reserve, we are intently focused on the dual-mandate goals given to us by Congress: maximum employment and stable prices.\nRecent Economic Data\nEconomic growth\nThe economy has been growing at a solid pace. GDP expanded at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year, extending a period of consistent growth that has been supported by resilient consumer spending. Recent indicators point to a possible moderation in consumer spending relative to the rapid growth rate over the second half of 2024. Further, recent surveys of households and businesses point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook. It remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment. Sentiment readings have not been a good predictor of consumption growth in recent years. We continue to carefully monitor a variety of indicators of household and business spending.\nThe labor market\nMany indicators show that the labor market is solid and broadly in balance. The jobs report released this morning showed employers added 151,000 jobs to payrolls in February and the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent last month. Smoothing over the month-to-month volatility, since September, employers have added a solid 191,000 jobs a month on average. The unemployment rate remains low and has held in a narrow range between 3.9 and 4.2 percent for the past year. The jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, and the quits rate has moved below pre-pandemic levels. Wages are growing faster than inflation, and at a more sustainable pace than earlier in the pandemic recovery. With wage growth moderating and labor supply and demand having moved into better balance, the labor market is not a significant source of inflationary pressure.\nInflation\nInflation has come down a long way from its mid-2022 peak above 7 percent without a sharp increase in unemployment\u00e2\u0080\u0094a historically unusual and most welcome outcome. While progress in reducing inflation has been broad based, recent readings remain somewhat above our 2 percent objective. The path to sustainably returning inflation to our target has been bumpy, and we expect that to continue. We see ongoing progress in categories that remain elevated, such as housing services and the market-based components of non-housing services. Inflation can be volatile month-to-month, and we do not overreact to one or two readings that are higher or lower than anticipated. Data released last week showed that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in January and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.6 percent. We pay close attention to a broad range of measures of inflation expectations, and some near-term measures have recently moved up. We see this in both market- and survey-based measures, and survey respondents, both consumers and businesses, are mentioning tariffs as a driving factor. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain stable and consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.\nMonetary Policy\nLooking ahead, the new Administration is in the process of implementing significant policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. It is the net effect of these policy changes that will matter for the economy and for the path of monetary policy. While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high. As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\nPolicy is not on a preset course. If the economy remains strong but inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. Our current policy stance is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.\nConclusion\nBefore I conclude, I will note that at our last FOMC meeting, we began our second five-year review of our monetary policy framework. We will consider changes to our consensus statement (Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy) and to our communications as part of this review. The consensus statement articulates our framework for the conduct of monetary policy in pursuit of the goals assigned to us by Congress. We will consider lessons of the past five years and adapt our approach, where appropriate, to best serve the American people, to whom we are accountable. The 2 percent longer-run inflation goal will be retained and is not a focus of the review.\nThis public review will be familiar to those who followed our process five years ago. We will hold outreach events around the country involving a wide range of parties, including\nFed Listens\nevents. We are open to new ideas and critical feedback. We will host a research conference in Washington in May. Our intent is to wrap up the review by late summer.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            March 07, 2025",

Kugler\nAt the Conference on Monetary Policy Transmission and the Labor Market, Banco de Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Tiago, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I am delighted to be at the Bank of Portugal, among friends, including Governor Centeno, and to be speaking at a conference focusing on matters I deeply care about\u00e2\u0080\u0094monetary policy and labor markets.\n1\nBefore I became a monetary policymaker, a large share of my work as an academic researcher addressed the effect on labor markets from policy choices such as payroll taxation, employment protections, occupational licensing, and unemployment insurance (UI). I was able to apply some of these insights in my work as the chief economist at the Department of Labor, analyzing the labor market and supporting research on policies and their effectiveness.\nAnd, of course, labor markets are central to carrying out the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. Recently, labor supply and demand in the United States have been roughly in balance, and the unemployment rate has been running close to the estimates of FOMC participants for its longer-run rate, which is consistent with the Committee's maximum-employment goal.\nToday's employment report for February corroborates this view. The net number of new jobs created was 151,000, not too far from the 177,000 average of the previous six months. The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, still in the narrow range between 4 percent and 4.2 percent that it has remained in since last summer. Labor force participation was 62.4 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0094likewise within the range of values observed in the past year. Consistent with this stability and evidence of balanced labor supply and demand, average hourly earnings are up 4 percent in the past 12 months, and with strong productivity growth in recent quarters, I do not believe wages are a significant source of inflation pressure.\nOn the price side of the FOMC's dual mandate, inflation has fallen significantly since its peak in mid-2022, and we have lowered our policy rate accordingly, with a reduction of 100 basis points since last September. Still, inflation has moved sideways since the second half of last year, with uneven progress across its major categories. Inflation for market-based core services excluding housing has stepped down to an estimated 2.4 percent in January from a level of about 3.5 percent in the first quarter of 2024. Housing inflation, which has stubbornly hovered above 5 percent for most of last year, has finally come down to an estimated 4.5 percent in January. Adding to that, measures of new rents, such as those published by CoreLogic, suggest further progress in housing inflation going forward.\nUnfortunately, one category of prices that has put upward pressure on inflation is \"non-market-based\" core services, which are imputed rather than observed. Although some of the components in that category may be affected by difficulties in measurement, others, such as prices for some financial services, are tied to the stock market and may have been signaling wealth effects that helped push up aggregate demand. Core goods inflation has also been slowly rising. In the first half of 2024, core goods inflation was negative 0.6 percent on average, close to its pre-COVID rate. But, starting in May, core goods inflation has stepped up, and it was estimated to be about 0.3 percent in January. Consistent with an increase in goods prices, the releases of manufacturing and nonmanufacturing surveys this week, including those by the Institute for Supply Management, showed a jump in prices paid for purchases inputs. This rise is not a welcome development because, over the long term, goods price deflation has offset price increases in other categories and kept a lid on overall inflation.\nNotwithstanding the well-balanced labor market, there are important upside risks to inflation. Some measures of inflation expectations have risen significantly in the past couple of months, including those from the Michigan survey, the Conference Board, and the Atlanta Fed's survey of businesses. For example, the measure of inflation expectations 1 year in the future from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers rose from 3.3 percent in December to 4.3 percent in January, while the expectations in the next 5 to 10 years rose over the same period\u00e2\u0080\u0094from 3.2 percent to 3.5 percent. There is also considerable uncertainty about the inflationary effects of new policies and policy proposals. With all these factors in mind, I strongly supported the FOMC's decision at our January meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Given the recent increase in inflation expectations and the key inflation categories that have not shown progress toward our 2 percent target, it could be appropriate to continue holding the policy rate at its current level for some time. Going forward, I will continue to closely monitor the effects of policies on the economy, and I will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and any changes in the balance of risks.\nLet me now take a step back. To understand the recent experience of a resilient and balanced U.S. labor market, it is helpful to look outward and consider how labor markets behaved around the world after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and its significant effects on employment. In the remainder of my remarks, I will discuss similarities and differences in labor market recoveries in different countries, with a special emphasis on the possible factors that helped the United States achieve a rebalancing of its labor market and rapid disinflation, and I will also address the potential for changes in these trends moving forward.\nThe\nworldwide pandemic disrupted the global economy and immediately caused high levels of unemployment and other forms of slackness in labor markets. While the timing and extent of job losses and recovery from the pandemic varied widely across advanced and emerging economies, there were some commonalities. By the spring of 2021, lower-skilled and younger workers had been hit harder than other groups, with larger increases in unemployment rates and larger declines in labor force participation.\n2\nAcross different countries, there was also considerable variation in labor market policies enacted in response to the pandemic disruptions. For example, while the United States pursued, among other initiatives, its usual approach of extended unemployment benefits to displaced workers, supplemented with unprecedented extra benefits to individuals, Australia and several European countries used short-term subsidies to employers to keep workers in their jobs. After accounting for these policy variations, which were, in some cases, rooted in longstanding differences in how different governments try to stabilize employment, academic research has also found significant variation in the reasons why people were not working during the acute phase of the pandemic.\n3\nFor instance, researchers found that, in the United States, a greater share of the unemployed had lost their jobs recently, while in Europe and Australia, it was more common for people to be absent from work; in South Korea, a larger share of those not working had dropped out of the labor force.\nThe decrease in labor supply around the world also affected different types of workers in different countries. Net immigration fell in North America and Europe. In the United States and the United Kingdom, people retired at greater rates than had been experienced before the pandemic.\n4\nIn the U.S., many workers caring for elderly or ill relatives or children out of school left their jobs and the labor force or curtailed the number of hours they worked.\n5\nIn one study that looked at the United States, Canada, and four European countries, the declines in employment and hours worked were particularly large among women, with this gender gap being at least partially explained by childcare needs.\n6\nWhile this difference between men and women was significant in the United States for both employment and hours, in other countries, such as Germany, it only generated a gender gap in hours worked, probably because Germany's policies were aimed at keeping workers in their jobs and minimizing dislocation. Across the world, the number of younger workers neither in school nor in the labor force also rose, with larger increases in North America relative to Western Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, the 3.5 percentage point increase in the United States from 2019 to 2020 compared with the 1.1 percentage point rise in Portugal during the same period.\n7\nWhile there were larger declines in the number of people working in the U.S., there was a larger decrease in labor supply in the euro area relative to the United States because of the substantial decline in total hours worked in Europe, which was at least partially due to retention and work-sharing programs during the pandemic.\nAs restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19 were eased and economies reopened, there were large imbalances between labor supply and demand. With a surprisingly rapid recovery in economic activity in most countries, labor demand surged, but labor supply continued to be hampered by many lingering factors, including illness, voluntary social distancing, early retirements, and still-low levels of net immigration.\n8\nAs economies reopened, the imbalance between supply and demand was amplified by consumers, who had been prevented from spending on many in-person services, abruptly switching their spending from goods to services.\n9\nThis substitution induced a large increase in the demand for workers in the services sector, leading to acute labor shortages in some industries. The labor shortage throughout the economy was reflected in low employment-to-population ratios and labor force participation rates (LFPRs) for many advanced economies. Tighter labor markets lowered unemployment rates and boosted wage growth in many economies in the second half of 2020, and, by the end of 2021, vacancy and quits rates were high.\n10\nWhile this tightness in labor markets was in evidence on both sides of the Atlantic, it was more acute in the United States, where we saw the vacancies-to-unemployment (V/U) ratio reach a historical peak of 2 in early 2022, two-thirds higher than its 2019 level. In the euro area, where the V/U ratio has traditionally been lower, Federal Reserve staff estimate that it also reached a historical high of 0.45 in the second quarter of 2022, more than 50 percent higher than its 2019 level.\nTo understand the cross-country differences in the rebalancing from tight to looser labor markets, I want to highlight three important factors that contributed to the cross-country performance of labor markets over the past few years: first, the increases in LFPRs, especially for prime-age workers; second, increased labor productivity; and third, an increase in net immigration and also the absorption of these immigrants into labor markets.\nLet's start with LFPRs. In the United States, after participation by prime-age workers fell early in the pandemic, its recovery was quite strong until last year, and it reached levels not seen since the late 1990s. A notable contributor to this recovery was the LFPR of prime-age women, which reached historical highs last year, likely due to additional help in childcare responsibilities from other family members and flexible work arrangements.\n11\nWhile prime-age worker participation recovered, the LFPR for all workers has remained stubbornly below its pre-pandemic level in the U.S. and other advanced economies. In the case of the United States, unusually high rates of retirement during the 2021\u00e2\u0080\u009322 period played an important role, a phenomenon driven by, among other factors, increases in wealth fueled by gains in the stock market and rising home prices.\n12\nOf course, another factor driving the drag in U.S. participation has been the aging of the population and the expected ongoing retirement of baby boomers.\nBy contrast, the euro area saw the LFPRs surpass their pre-pandemic levels by early 2022, as policies in these countries promoted job retention. Moreover, because far fewer Europeans continue working after the age of 65, the participation rate of older workers did not fall as much during the pandemic.\nDifferences in labor market policies likely contributed to the different recovery paths of the LFPR across advanced economies. In the United States, estimates show that unemployed workers leave the labor force at a rate about 10 times higher than that of employed workers.\n13\nAfter leaving the labor force, a typical worker remains there for a significant period and may never again look for work. Thus, one might expect that labor market policies that have different effects on the severity of spikes in unemployment would also affect labor force participation differently.\n14\nAs many European countries that faced lower increases in unemployment also faced lower decreases in the LFPR, it seems that unemployment spells during the COVID-driven downturn might have contributed to exits from the labor force. So, to the extent that the emphasis on job retention in Europe helped limit such exits, this policy choice may have helped explain the higher rates of labor force participation in the euro area relative to the United States.\nThe second factor I want to highlight that boosted labor supply during the economic recovery from the pandemic is productivity growth, which in a way acts like an increase in labor supply, as it increases the output that each worker can produce. It seems likely that U.S. labor market policies spurred the higher rates of productivity growth in the United States relative to the euro area.\nOn the one hand, worker retention policies in Europe preserved the human capital of those specific firm\u00e2\u0080\u0093worker relationships. These relationships are quite valuable when job-finding rates are low, and workers may spend longer times being unemployed.\n15\nIndeed, euro-area businesses have been reluctant to let go of workers, and indicators of labor hoarding are higher than their pre-pandemic levels.\n16\nOne consequence of this hoarding is that hours per worker remain below pre-pandemic levels, pointing to a lower output per worker.\nOn the other hand, in economies such as the United States that have relatively higher job-finding rates, UI promotes the flow of workers to more-productive sectors of the economy and results in less labor hoarding. Research by Federal Reserve staff shows more sectoral reallocation of workers in the United States compared with the euro area.\n1",

Bowman\nAt the 2025 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, New York, New York\nShare\nThank you for the invitation to participate at this year's U.S. Monetary Policy Forum conference. It is a pleasure to be here to discuss the conference report and present my views on the transmission of monetary policy to real activity in recent years.\n1\nI would like to start by thanking the authors of the paper for their thoughtful and comprehensive analysis of the effects of monetary policy on economic activity. As you all may know, my background is in banking and bank regulation, so my experience with and interest in understanding the transmission and effects of monetary policy stems from my responsibilities as a Member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nTurning to the discussion, I will begin with a few comments and suggestions on the paper and then focus on how monetary policy and other factors influenced U.S. economic performance during the tightening cycle that started in March 2022. I will then conclude with some thoughts on the relevance of the results in the paper for monetary policy going forward.\nComments and Suggestions on \"Monetary Policy Transmission to Real Activity\"\nThe paper's stated purpose is to estimate how monetary policy shocks affect gross domestic product (GDP) and employment through the use of a range of models. The evidence is generally similar to previous studies, supporting the broader principle that monetary policy exerts its effects with long lags and has a limited contribution to changes in real activity when the shock is small and not very persistent. We should keep in mind, however, that many other shocks hit the economy and that at times it may be hard to see the effects of monetary policy actions estimated in the paper as they work through the actual economy.\nThe paper notes that a 1 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate that retraces gradually, taking five to six quarters to reach half of its initial size, has persistent negative effects on GDP and employment. At maximum, this shock lowers GDP by 0.4 percent in about 18 months and employment by 0.3 percent in about two years, on average across the models considered in the paper. However, there is a wide range of estimated responses, as they depend on each model specification and the data used. The most sensitive components of GDP are residential investment, business fixed investment, and durable goods consumption, which is consistent with employment in the construction and durable goods manufacturing industries being highly interest-rate sensitive.\nThe paper analyzes the transmission of monetary policy to real activity, but it would have been very interesting to go one step further and also see the effects of monetary policy on inflation. This is especially relevant because the FOMC has been focused on bringing inflation down to its 2 percent target over the past few years. Of course, higher interest rates lower inflation by dampening aggregate demand and real activity, thereby removing pressure on resource utilization, wages, and prices.\nThe authors use several models to analyze the transmission of monetary policy. They use two well-known structural models created by Federal Reserve Board staff that have been used in Tealbook, the FRB/US and EDO models, in addition to two reduced-form VAR models, the New York Fed Bayesian VAR model and a simple four-variable proxy VAR model. It is reassuring that the estimated responses to a federal funds rate shock in the two models that I am most familiar with, the Board FRB/US and EDO models, seem consistent with previous findings.\n2\nOne small issue is that neither of the VAR models directly includes the federal funds rate. The authors acknowledge this limitation in the analysis and address it by roughly estimating that a 100-basis points shock to the policy rate boosts the 1-year and 2\u00e2\u0080\u0091year Treasury yields by 45 and 40 basis points, respectively. This approach may have resulted in the implied monetary policy shock in the two VAR models looking more persistent than in the two structural models. I would suggest the authors take another look at this aspect of their exercise, so that the contours of the monetary policy shocks look more similar across the different models.\nAn alternative approach would have been to take the 1- and 2-year averages of the federal funds rate from the FRB/US and EDO impulse responses and possibly add a small term premium. This approach would have suggested larger effects of the federal funds rate shock on the 1- and 2-year Treasury yields than estimated by the authors. Another approach, especially in the proxy VAR setting, would have been to use a measure of the shadow federal funds rate, which provides a gauge of the overall monetary policy stance and is not constrained by the zero lower bound.\n3\nThe paper focused on the effect of changes in the policy rate, but an important channel for the transmission of monetary policy is how it affects private interest rates that are relevant for households and businesses consumption and investment decisions. Private rates include interest rates charged on outstanding credit card balances, rates on auto and other durable goods loans, mortgage rates, and corporate bond yields. Although credit card rates move closely in line with the policy rate and include a time-varying spread that depends on the default risk profile of the borrower, longer-term private fixed rates on mortgages and corporate bonds depend on the expected path of the federal funds rate, the term premium embedded in longer-term Treasury yields, and risk spreads relative to Treasury securities of comparable maturity. Accordingly, monetary policy tools other than the policy rate, including forward guidance and the amount of securities holdings in the central bank's balance sheet, are also important for the transmission of monetary policy since they can more forcefully affect the expected path of the federal funds rate, term premiums, and risk spreads.\nThe authors analyze the contribution of major aggregate demand components to the overall effect of a monetary policy shock on GDP. One minor issue is that not all the models treat business investment equally. In particular, the EDO model includes inventory investment under business investment, while all other models do not appear to do so. This difference may contribute to the much larger initial reaction of business investment in the EDO model compared to the other models, as inventory investment reacts quickly to a shock in the federal funds rate.\nI would like to offer one last comment on the relatively small effect of monetary policy on real activity. Although I do not disagree with the authors' assessment, I think that the estimated effects can cumulate to be quite sizable even for the transient unexpected shock considered. The FOMC quickly raised interest rates to fight surging inflation between March 2022 and July 2023 by a cumulative 5-1/4 percentage points. According to the average impulse responses, a shock of this magnitude would lead to declines of about 2 percent on the level of real GDP and 1.5 percent on the level of employment, which would translate into a similarly large increase in the unemployment rate if those who lost their jobs mostly remained in the labor force. This seems to suggest the potential for fairly large effects on real activity, especially when the monetary policy shock has more persistent effects on the policy rate and results in larger increases in term premiums and risk spreads.\nThe Recent Tightening Cycle\nThe FOMC started raising the federal funds rate in March 2022 to combat rising inflation. Although the initial rate hike was a mere 1/4 percentage point, the pace of tightening was faster over the remainder of the year, with an overall increase of more than 4 percentage points in the policy rate by the end of 2022. Rate hikes continued in smaller 1/4 percentage point steps the following year, adding to 1 additional percentage point increase by July 2023. As the authors note in the paper, the rapid pace of monetary policy tightening was somewhat surprising, especially as the FOMC was initially slow to react to signs that the rise in inflation during 2021 was not merely transitory and required more aggressive action.\nAs financial conditions tightened rapidly and the yield curve inverted in 2022, fears of an impending recession started to rise, with Federal Reserve Board staff mentioning downside risks to real activity and that a mild recession seemed equally likely to the baseline Tealbook projection for sluggish economic growth over the next year.\n4\nThe staff eventually predicted a mild recession in the Tealbook forecast after the bank failures and banking system stress in the spring of 2023.\n5\nSuch recession was widely predicted and, in hindsight, it never materialized. As you well know, the yield curve inversion has not been the only predictor of recessions that has failed in recent years.\nOn a Q4-over-Q4 basis, GDP growth slowed considerably in 2022 to a modest pace of only 1.3 percent. The components of GDP that exerted the most drag on growth that year were residential investment, goods consumption, and inventory investment, subtracting a total of 1\u00e2\u0080\u00911/2 percentage points from real GDP growth in 2022.\nResidential investment weakened rather quickly and fell more than 16 percent in 2022. The sharp decline in this category seems largely explained by higher mortgage rates, which surged more than 3 percentage points over the course of the year as the FOMC aggressively tightened monetary policy. In addition to higher interest rates, the 1-1/2 percent drop in goods consumption in 2022 likely reflected the imprint of higher inflation on real disposable income and the unwinding of previous fiscal stimulus.\nSomewhat at odds with the empirical results in the paper, business fixed investment continued to rise appreciably as special factors led to a delayed response to the rise in interest rates. A broader measure of business investment that includes inventories did show a slowdown in growth, but even this broad measure continued to rise appreciably in 2022. Business fixed investment was likely supported by construction of new microchip and battery plants, the continued boost to software investment following the switch to remote work, and a rebound in nonresidential structures and transportation equipment investment after their protracted decline over the pandemic.\nPayroll employment increased strongly in 2022 as labor force participation rose, the unemployment rate declined, and the labor market tightened considerably. Payroll employment moved back up to its pre-pandemic level and approached its trend as social distancing receded. The recovery dynamics in employment largely masked any effects from rising interest rates in 2022. The effect from higher interest rates on employment also tends to lag and be more persistent than the effect on GDP, so any effects likely showed up in 2023, an outcome that is consistent with the findings in the paper.\nSome Reasons Why the Economy Outperformed\nThe economy outperformed in 2023 as widespread predictions of an impending recession never materialized and instead growth picked up. From the point of view of the models in the paper, the stronger economy in 2023 also seems surprising, but this likely reflected other factors that influenced the economy and that are not accounted for in the model simulations.\nDespite significant tightening in broad financial conditions in 2023, GDP growth strengthened notably as fiscal policy turned from a drag into a meaningful boost to growth and potential output accelerated further due to increased immigration and strong productivity growth. These favorable supply developments allowed for stronger economic activity along with easing of inflationary pressures. Although growth surprised to the upside in 2023, labor market tightness eased with the unemployment rate edging up over the year and payroll employment growth slowing markedly.\nFaster GDP growth in 2023 was driven by a rebound in goods consumption, some recovery in residential investment, and stronger government spending. Goods consumption was boosted by strong gains in real compensation and personal income, including from declining inflation. Despite continued drag from higher mortgage rates, residential investment started recovering in 2023 as other factors supported demand. In particular, the labor market remained strong and household balance sheets were still healthy. The sharp rise in mortgage rates also created a lock\u00e2\u0080\u0091in effect that increased demand for new housing and construction activity.\nThe marked deceleration in employment in 2023 seems consistent with the longer lags in the response of employment to the rise in interest rates relative to that of GDP, especially as a significant portion of employment gains reflected increased labor supply from immigration, which allowed the labor market to come into better balance. Also consistent with the paper results, employment gains in the construction and durable goods manufacturing industries were more noticeably below their 2015-2019 trends than employment gains for the aggregate economy.\nAs the authors argue, another reason why real activity was more resilient in the face of higher interest rates may have been the healthy balance sheets of households and businesses at the start of the tightening cycle. Households had accumulated excess savings during the pandemic, reflecting both increased fiscal stimulus and reduced consumption due to social distancing and supply bottlenecks.\n6\nIn fact, data from the Financial Accounts of the U.S. indicate that in the two years between the end of 2019 and the end of 2021, household bank deposits rose by nearly $4 trillion.\n7\nIn addition, many households and nonfinancial businesses were able to refinance their mortgages and corporate bonds at very low rates during the pandemic. Although higher interest rates likely held back additional consumption expenditures and investment spending, they had less of an effect on households' and nonfinancial businesses' net cash flows as the average interest rates on household mortgages and business debt remained low.\n8\nWith historically low borrowing costs during the pandemic era, mortgage originations and refinancing activity reached very high levels. As a result, the share of outstanding mortgages with an interest rate below 4 percent increased to nearly 70 percent by 2022 and it remains well above pre-pandemic levels today. Similarly, nonfinancial businesses issued record amounts of corporate bonds and extended the maturity of their debt to avoid new debt issuance e",

Bowman\nAt The Robbins Banking Institute Lecture Series, Hays, Kansas\nShare\nIt is a pleasure to join you today at Fort Hays State University for the Robbins Banking Institute Lecture.\n1\nI have been a supporter of this institute since it was first created here at Fort Hays State, including by giving a lecture to students during my tenure as the Kansas State Bank Commissioner. Today, my view is slightly different than at that time, and I thought it would be a good time to share my thoughts on the critical role community banks play, not only in the U.S. banking system but also as drivers of local and regional economic growth and as anchors of their local communities. I will also explore the responsibility of bank regulators to support community banks.\nIn a broad and diverse economy, banks of all sizes play an important role in the creation and funding of business and consumer opportunities and investments. Without this diverse banking ecosystem, 30 percent of American communities would not have access to a physical bank location. There is little doubt that community banks have an extensive presence across this landscape and that they are essential to the success of the American economy.\nNo other country in the world enjoys this direct access to and presence of financial services in remote and rural areas. These bankers are members of the community. They are neighbors and friends, and their kids attend local schools and play sports in the local recreational league. The term \"relationship\" banking has true meaning in this context.\nThe direct relationships provide an opportunity for bankers to understand the unique financing needs of local businesses and enables them to develop specialized services for specific segments of the local economy, including agriculture and small business lending.\n2\nCommunity banks are catalysts for local economic growth, and their bankers often also serve as civic leaders in the region. I served as one of those community leaders while I was a banker in Council Grove. That experience\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether serving as the President of the local Chamber of Commerce or the Rotary Club\u00e2\u0080\u0094provided a unique view into the local economy. And today, as I travel across the country to visit with bankers in just about every state, I learn about how they are driving investment, philanthropy, and financial support for the local economy. While this work is rewarding, it is also challenging. It is sometimes tedious\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially in today's regulatory environment\u00e2\u0080\u0094and it is a seven days a week job. Bankers are often \"working\" while engaged in social activities, attending church or their kids athletic events, and shopping at the grocery store, and I often hear about customers giving a loan payment to their banker in the grocery store or asking about financing terms for the new car they might have their eye on.\nOnce a policymaker grasps the perspective of community banking from this vantage point, it becomes clear that the regulatory approach is much more complex than necessary to address many small bank issues. A community bank that has no out-of-market customers applying for new accounts likely does not need the same know-your-customer processes as a large or regional bank that opens accounts online and may be more vulnerable to fraud. A community bank can operate safely and soundly, and in compliance with laws, without being subject to the same extensive guidance and regulatory requirements as larger, more complex banks that offer a broader range of products and may be exposed to wider range of risks. A number of onerous requirements imposed on community banks seem to reflect an assumption of an indirect and less personal banking relationship.\nPublic debates about the banking system often feature academics that tend to downplay the significant role of community banks in the financial system. Instead, they imagine a banking system with fewer banks as equally effective in meeting the banking needs of every community throughout the United States. The eight largest U.S. banks hold $15.4 trillion in assets, which is several times larger than the assets controlled by the more than 4,000 community banks in the United States.\n3\nBut as we all know, aggregate asset size is not an accurate indication of these banks' importance.\nOf course, metrics do not provide the full picture of how relationship-based lending practices drive local economic activity. They ignore that banking has a regional component, where local knowledge and expertise\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a commitment to the local community\u00e2\u0080\u0094can help enable the community to thrive. There is an important place for the largest banks and regional banks in the banking system, but it is a fallacy to assume that the presence of fewer community banks would not have devastating consequences for a number of consumers and businesses. Some community banks serve rural and underserved banking markets and may be the only option for consumers and businesses, especially those that have unique balance sheets or less pristine credit histories. If community banks were to disappear, many communities would be left with few or no alternative options for banking services.\nWhile metrics do not tell the whole story, this is not meant to downplay the importance of data, research, and analysis, all of which assist us in our understanding of the banking system and how that understanding could be improved. Data can help us identify issues that must be addressed or remediated. Data can help us evaluate which elements of the current bank regulatory framework may be effective or ineffective. And data can help regulators update regulations and guidance with a clearer understanding of the intended and unintended consequences.\nOver the past 20 years, we have seen the number of community banks continue to decline. Bank consolidation through mergers has contributed to this decline, and de novo bank formation has been largely nonexistent. Many factors have contributed to the bank consolidation trend, including competition from nonbank financial service providers and the ever-increasing regulatory burdens on the community banking model. Many of these same challenges have acted as a deterrent to bankers who have considered pursuing a de novo bank charter. And while many factors influence the health of the community bank model\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the interest rate environment, economic conditions, and alternative sources of competition for credit\u00e2\u0080\u0094we should consider whether there are actions regulators can take to support and ensure the future of community banks.\nThe Benefits of Experience\nOne of the biggest barriers to the community bank model is the competition for qualified bank management and staff. Attracting, developing, and retaining future and current bank leadership is a significant challenge. Yet, one of the most important priorities for bank management is to develop the next generation of leadership. Educational programs like this institute, bank and regulator internships, and regional graduate schools of banking can help develop this pipeline of talent to support the industry and supervisory responsibilities. These programs also help regulators recruit the next generation of bank examiners.\nWorking in my family's community bank reinforced the mission focus and relationship model of community banking for me. This holds true for many family-owned community banks across the country.\nSince we are on the campus of Fort Hays State University today and we have a number of students in the audience, part of my message today is to encourage each of you to consider exploring a career in the financial services industry\u00e2\u0080\u0094including in community banking or with a state or federal banking regulator. Whether that experience becomes a lifelong career or a stepping stone along your path, having experience in banking provides valuable perspective on how local economies function and the importance of access to banking services and financial inclusion. This experience has helped to shape my perspective and approach as the state bank commissioner and as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\nThis experience is also not something that I take for granted\u00e2\u0080\u0094seeing different perspectives empowers me to be a better policymaker. For example, as a bank compliance officer you understand the challenges of ensuring the bank is in compliance with rules and guidance and is prepared for interactions with bank examiners. Further, having this perspective enables a policymaker to approach the process of drafting rules and guidance and relaying supervisory messages in a way that recognizes a need for clarity, efficiency, and simplicity. The outcomes of our work are enhanced by a better understanding of the costs and unintended consequences of getting it wrong.\nThe Responsibility of Regulators\nOverregulation and unnecessary rules and guidance imposed on smaller and community banks create disproportionate burdens on these banks, eventually eroding the viability of the community banking model.\nPolicymakers and regulators have a responsibility to ensure that the banking and financial systems encourage growth and innovation and foster a strong and growing economy. One of the great strengths of the U.S. banking system is the variety of institutions that meet the needs of consumers and businesses, not only through offering a range of products and services but also by reaching customers throughout the country, including in the most rural and remote locations. Our goal must be to facilitate a banking and regulatory environment that enables banks of all types and sizes to thrive. For community banks, this includes building a better regulatory and supervisory framework to effectively support the unique characteristics of these institutions.\nWhat should that framework look like?\nFirst, it includes thresholds that better reflect risk and business model.\nAs currently defined, community banks are those with less than $10 billion in assets. The Federal Reserve divides banks into distinct supervisory portfolios that oversee \"community,\" \"regional,\" and four categories of larger banks.\n4\nThe portfolio approach helps regulators differentiate standards and supervisory focus based on bank characteristics and risks. In theory, it allows examiners to better organize supervisory activities and to provide specialized training to help examiners focus on issues that are most relevant for the institutions being examined. If appropriately executed, this portfolio-based approach should lead to better and more risk-focused supervision, and in turn a safer and more sound banking system.\nAn organizational structure that better allocates and directs supervisory resources seems like a worthwhile goal, but over time, it becomes clear that there are downsides to this approach. One of these downsides is the static nature of the fixed thresholds defining the categories. Currently, our framework includes fixed thresholds that are not adjusted with economic growth, inflation, or the growth in deposits from unexpected sources and fiscal programs, like those from the COVID era. They also do not account for changed industry dynamics, especially those resulting from a particular bank's activities or risk profile. In this environment, some firms with stable growth, a static business model, and a straightforward risk profile cross the $10 billion threshold unintentionally, subjecting them to additional regulatory and supervisory requirements that were specifically designed and implemented for larger and more complex firms. Banks approaching the $10 billion threshold often choose to curtail their asset growth to stay below the threshold.\nAnother significant problem with the current approach\u00e2\u0080\u0094that specifically challenges community banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094is the failure to index and update how a community bank is defined. Given the low fixed-dollar asset thresholds, regulators must focus on ensuring that asset-based benchmarks remain reasonable and appropriate in their work to supervise banks, especially as they apply tailored, but static, supervisory standards. As is the case now, over time, economic growth and inflation have created an environment in which thresholds are inappropriately low.\nWe also need to implement a better, more timely, transparent, and viable path for all bank regulatory applications. The application process can be a significant obstacle to applications activity, in particular mergers and acquisitions. Applications often experience significant delays between the application filing date and before receiving final regulatory approval. In some cases, even for non-complex transactions, the regulatory approval process has taken more than a year. A healthy banking system is one in which banks can make decisions to merge with peers or acquire new assets or business lines, and one that allows new bank formation, in a reasonable amount of time in accordance with statutory timelines. As the bank applications process has become a barrier to bank merger activity, we have seen credit unions acquiring community banks in record numbers. In the absence of a better functioning bank applications process, institutions will explore other options, including credit union acquisitions.\nI think this trend should be a wake up call for regulators to reevaluate our approaches to many areas of our responsibility, but especially whether our applications processes are operating as effectively and efficiently as they should. It is important that the regulatory framework ensures that competition and broader availability of banking services remain a feature of the U.S. banking system.\nA necessary approach to solving this is by making targeted improvements to the applications process. If you follow my work, you know that I often discuss how the applications process can be improved.\n5\nSo I will note some of the important changes that I believe would be a catalyst to returning our bank applications review function to an appropriate processing timeline. These are simply threshold steps that should be easy to accomplish and would be a great start to fundamentally improving the process.\nI believe that we should not be complacent when facing excessive and longstanding delays. For bank applications, we must focus our resources and expertise to review and promptly act on all bank applications, to streamline the required forms and procedures, and to provide clear standards for approval.\nBank regulators should be prepared to act promptly on applications, and yet the significant delays in applications processing we see suggests we can do better. The published statistics on applications processing also tell an incomplete story, as they do not reflect the time spent by applicants who withdraw applications before fin",

Barr\nAt Alliance for Innovative Regulation, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nThanks to the Alliance for Innovative Regulation for organizing this event and for bringing together banks, fintechs, and regulators to collaborate and foster responsible innovation.\n1\nInnovation, when done responsibly, brings tremendous benefits to consumers, financial institutions, and the economy at large. Innovation can make financial products and services better, cheaper, and safer. It can make banking accessible to more consumers, advancing financial inclusion. It can modernize our financial infrastructures, creating efficiencies and providing new tools for banks to manage risk.\nInnovation also comes with risks that need to be managed responsibly. Responsible innovation is in everyone's interest. Consumers want the benefits of innovation through products and services they can trust. Banks have an interest in managing the complexities of innovation responsibly, ensuring that they recognize new and evolving risks to safety and soundness, follow relevant laws, and protect and serve their customers. Fintechs often play a key role in offering products and services that allow banks to meet these needs. And regulators and supervisors should develop regulatory and supervisory frameworks that allow banks to clearly understand and manage the risks associated with innovative activities. To achieve that, regulators should provide ongoing transparency and clarity on our approach.\nToday, I'd like to share how the Federal Reserve's Novel Activities Supervision Program, launched in the summer of 2023, plays an important role in supporting responsible innovation at our supervised institutions.\n2\nPrior to this program, the Federal Reserve established temporary working groups and task forces to better understand evolving technologies to inform supervision. Ultimately, though, we determined we needed a dedicated supervisory function for novel activities. There were a number of factors driving that decision that guided how we designed the Program.\nFirst, we understood that the pace of innovation was rapid. And we knew there would, of course, be benefits and risks stemming from innovation in the financial system. So we tasked the Novel Program with monitoring and understanding how these innovations and associated novel activities are used in banking and what benefits and risks they would pose. We gave them the mandate to keep up with the expertise related to use of new technologies and to employ new tools and data analytics in supervision. We invested time and research in understanding new technologies and businesses because we understood the importance of allowing innovation in the sector and avoiding excessively rigid stances on risk that don't take into account the potential to make advancements in the sector and economy that benefit all of society.\nSecond, we recognized that many financial institutions across the country are exploring and using many of the same technologies and similar novel business models. We felt it was important to create a coordinated approach to supervising novel activities across the Federal Reserve System. We initially identified two dozen firms, including firms of all sizes, for supervision by the Novel Activities Program. Firms are added or removed from the Program based on their engagement in novel activities. The supervisory program is designed to build a broad-based perspective of novel activities, the benefits and risks, and how those risks are managed. In this way, the Novel Program helps to enable similar supervision of similar risks, in a manner that reflects our current understanding of those activities in a variety of contexts.\nThird, while the technologies and products used by banks may be similar, their application and thus the benefits and risks may vary across business models. We understand the importance of tiering supervision to the type, extent, and level of risk posed by the novel activities and varied business models of supervised institutions and not imposing undue burden on firms. The Novel Activities Program employs a risk-based approach to supervision\u00e2\u0080\u0094meaning that the intensity of supervision is commensurate with the risk and scale of the activity. There is no one-size-fits-all model. Experts from the Novel team join the traditional supervisory teams that banks are used to working with on a regular basis, so there is no disruption or change in how we engage with banks. The Program is dynamic. As a bank changes its activities in this space, the rigor of the supervision similarly changes.\n3\nThe Novel Activities Program serves as a central point of expertise on new and innovative activities, supporting coordinated and risk-based supervision, and facilitating collaboration and communication between supervisors and stakeholders, all of whom contribute to supporting responsible innovation.\nNext, let me speak to two important principles in our Novel Program\u00e2\u0080\u0094clarity and collaboration.\nClarity\nStarting with clarity: for banks beginning to explore new technologies, supervisors should engage early in the process to understand the technology and the risks and provide a clear sense of their expectations along the way. Engagement allows for banks and their supervisors to share perspectives on effective risk management practices and the application of new technologies. Early and open dialogue creates opportunities for supervisors to provide feedback to banks on necessary risk management frameworks early on in their innovation process and to have an open dialogue that builds trust as products go to market.\nAs novel activities become more developed, we can issue guidance, resources, and other types of communications to further disseminate information, gather input, and provide clarity on effective risk management for novel activities. For example, in May 2024, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation released a guide to assist community banks in developing and implementing third-party risk management practices, which could be a useful resource for banks seeking to engage in novel, technology-based partnerships.\n4\nA few months later, the agencies issued a joint statement on arrangements with third parties to deliver bank deposit products and services, which discusses the risks these arrangements can present, offers examples of practices to manage those risks, and reminds banks of existing requirements and supervisory expectations.\n5\nThere is no-one-size-fits-all approach in how we engage and communicate guidance to our firms, but it is essential that engagement happen to provide clarity to both sides.\nI have said it before many times and want to reiterate it here: the Federal Reserve neither prohibits nor discourages banking organizations from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation. It is up to banks to choose their own customers, and not supervisors. That has been and will continue to be our practice. In fact, banks supervised by the Federal Reserve provide material and important services to the crypto-industry. For example, banks supervised by the Fed operate real-time, 24/7 payment platforms that serve as a primary mechanism for companies to exchange dollars to settle crypto-asset transactions. We monitor that activity from both a safety and soundness and financial stability lens, but we do not tell banks to serve or not serve those customers.\nCollaboration\nTurning to collaboration, the private sector is at the forefront of innovation and that ongoing engagement and collaboration with industry gives supervisors insight into the evolving nature of novel innovations and developments. Insights gathered from supervision, analysis, and monitoring activities, and industry engagement, can identify real improvements to how financial services are delivered to households and businesses and how risks are managed by banks. Collaboration can also reveal areas where we can provide regulatory clarity for banks looking to engage in new activities.\nI want to emphasize the importance of hearing from the public through tools like requests for information, or RFIs. The bank regulatory agencies published an interagency RFI on bank-fintech arrangements last July.\n6\nThe purpose of the RFI was to build on the agencies' understanding of these arrangements by soliciting updated input on the nature of bank-fintech arrangements. This included effective risk management practices regarding those arrangements, and the implications of such arrangements for bank risk management, safety and soundness, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We were also interested in understanding whether enhancements to existing supervisory guidance would be considered helpful in addressing the risks associated with these types of arrangements. We received over 100 comments. Respondents shared their insights on many topics, including the risks and benefits of these arrangements and how the agencies can bring additional clarity to our supervisory expectations. Some in the banking sector commented that the Novel Activities Program is an example of how cross-team collaboration might deepen an agency's understanding of technology and innovation. The Federal Reserve and the other agencies are carefully considering the feedback we received as we consider how we can continue to support responsible innovation.\nWe will continue to invest time and resources learning more about innovative technologies such as distributed ledger technology and bank-fintech partnerships to understand how they may benefit the institutions we supervise and their customers. Moreover, interagency coordination and knowledge-sharing with federal and state regulators and the private sector continue to be critical sources of discussion, engagement, and knowledge-building.\nIn Closing\nIn closing, thank you for this opportunity to outline the Fed's Novel Activities Program, which I believe has already improved the clarity and consistency of our supervision related to innovative technologies and fostered collaboration as banks and supervisors seek to better understand the risks associated with these activities. I believe this approach will support innovation that benefits consumers while supporting safety and soundness. Thank you.\n1.

Barr\nAt Yale School of Management, Program on Financial Stability, New Haven, Connecticut\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nI note that the objectives of the Program on Financial Stability include \"supporting the world's financial authorities in refining proven crises management tools and strategies.\"\n2\nSpeaking as a representative of one of those authorities, I thought I would further the program's goals by focusing these remarks on the principles and practice of crisis management. I am favored in that task with what one might call the luck of having been regularly confronted with crises in each of my three stints as a public servant, over a career divided between government and academia. In noting how often my arrival in government was accompanied by crisis, it might be reasonable to wonder if this is correlation or causation.\nKidding aside, crisis management is central to all management because it demands the very best from managers when it is most needed. Anyone who spends time in government can expect that some of the most memorable and challenging experiences will be managing through tough situations, when the answers to problems are unclear but the mission of the organization comes into acute focus. The financial system is in a perpetual state balancing risk and reward. Sometimes the system falls out of balance, and vulnerabilities turn into stress or even crisis. This moment is when it is crucial to mitigate spillovers from the financial system that can hurt businesses and households and wreak havoc on the economy at large.\nSome of the most important features of modern economies were developed to prevent and mitigate financial crises. The first central banks, and eventually the Federal Reserve, were created to provide stable currencies and banking systems in support of the long-term stability of the provision of credit necessary to foster growth and rising living standards. Regulation of financial markets, regulation and supervision of banks, federal deposit insurance, and laws to protect investors, consumers, and businesses were developed over time to promote both financial stability and durable economic growth. I have spoken previously about how monetary policy and financial stability are inextricably linked and how the tools we use to conduct monetary policy and support financial stability work together.\n3\nIn the spring of 2023, the United States faced the prospect of a spiraling stress event, when poor management and excessive risk-taking by Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) led to a run that quickly spread to other banks and threatened the wider banking system. Shortcomings in supervision and gaps in the regulatory framework also contributed to SVB's failure, and I've spoken about the steps the Federal Reserve has taken to improve supervision and other steps to close regulatory gaps.\n4\nToday, I'd like to talk about how effective management of the banking stress in the spring of 2023 helped prevent that event from spiraling into a financial crisis.\nGiven our student audience, I will begin with a little background on how I got into the crisis management business. After Yale Law School and two court clerkships, I worked at the State Department and then went to work for Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin in 1995. When I arrived, the Treasury Department had helped Mexico deal with a financial crisis that threatened to spread to the United States, and additional crises were to come in 1997 in Asia and in 1998 in Russia. Together, these events credibly threatened a worldwide financial crisis, which was averted by a response across the U.S. government and coordinated with governments and lending institutions around the world. I left government for academia in 2001 and then returned to Treasury in 2009 under Secretary Tim Geithner, in the midst of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). I worked to develop what became known as the Dodd-Frank Act. This law was a pivotal component of our response to the GFC by addressing gaps in financial market oversight, including through strengthened regulation and supervision of banks that increased the safeguards against the excessive risk-taking that caused the crisis. I went back to academia again in 2011 and then returned to public service as the Federal Reserve Board's Vice Chair for Supervision in July 2022. In this position, I oversaw the response to the bank failures in March 2023 and have helped develop ways to reduce these and other risks going forward.\nThe March 2023 Banking Stress\nLet me review some facts about what happened, so you can understand the context for how we put crisis management principles and practices to work.\nSVB failed because of a textbook case of mismanagement of interest rate and liquidity risk.\n5\nThis mismanagement made uninsured depositors lose confidence in the bank's solvency, so they ran. While this was a textbook case, the speed and severity of the run were unprecedented. The largest previous bank failure before SVB was of Washington Mutual in 2008.\n6\nThe accumulation of stresses that resulted in Washington Mutual's failure occurred over several weeks. By contrast, SVB's deposit outflows were much greater in both relative and absolute terms, and they occurred in less than 24 hours. On top of that, the bank had major gaps in its liquidity risk management, including its preparedness to tap contingency liquidity.\n7\nBecause this discussion is for future first responders, I will share with you some detail about what it's like to be on the front lines working to address a bank run. On the morning of Thursday, March 9, 2023, SVB had only a little over $5 billion in collateral pledged to the discount window, as compared to over $150 billion in uninsured deposits.\n8\nAround midday, the firm contacted the Federal Reserve, indicating that it wanted to take out a discount window loan against this collateral, and the loan was granted. But in the next several hours, its account was drained as its deposit outflows spiraled. In the late afternoon, the firm indicated that it would need additional liquidity to meet expected outflows. The Federal Reserve worked with the firm to help it identify additional assets it could pledge to the discount window, but SVB was unsuccessful in identifying and moving sufficient collateral. Fed staff worked with the firm through the night to establish ad hoc collateral arrangements, so that the firm could tap the discount window further to meet its liquidity needs in the morning.\nWhile this process was happening overnight, however, the volume of online deposit withdrawal requests was growing, such that SVB management expected outflows of over $100 billion the next day, an unprecedented sum.\n9\nEven if the bank were able to pledge all collateral available that morning to the discount window, the firm would not have been able to meet its obligations. It was not viable. The state of California closed the bank and turned it over to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for resolution.\nSVB's failure contributed to the strains at FDIC-supervised Signature Bank, and that bank failed in short order. As the situation intensified, the effects on businesses and households became increasingly apparent. Critically, these failures caused a reassessment of the viability of uninsured deposits as a funding source across the banking system. But strains at other banks materialized despite material differences between these firms. The rapidity of equity market price declines for several banks triggered repeated trading halts for their shares. Online deposits began to migrate out of smaller banks to larger banks, putting pressure on these smaller institutions.\n10\nCommercial customers that had remaining deposits at SVB after it failed realized that they would not have access to their deposits and thus wouldn't be able to make payroll or even stay in business.\n11\nThe severity and rapidity of the spread of stress warranted a decisive response. We developed a two-part strategy that weekend.\nOn March 12, the Treasury Secretary, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve announced that the FDIC would protect uninsured deposits at SVB and Signature Bank under the systemic risk exception to least-cost resolution.\n12\nThis action essentially implied that all depositors, insured and uninsured, would have access to their deposits Monday morning. And the step helped calm uninsured depositors around the country.\nAlso on March 12, the Federal Reserve established the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) under its emergency lending authority with the approval of and a backstop from the Treasury.\n13\nThe BTFP's terms and conditions addressed the fundamental source of banking-sector jitters: questions about the ability of a range of banks to hold onto their high-quality securities that had lost value because of interest rate increases. Unrealized losses on securities portfolios were a problem for many banks, particularly when the stability of their deposit bases came into question. The BTFP provided stable funding for these high-quality assets, addressing these concerns. Specifically, the BTFP provided one-year loans to banks in sound financial condition against Treasury securities and agency securities, valued at par.\nBy doing so, the BTFP addressed banks' immediate concerns about the stability of their funding and mitigated the risk that banks would be forced to liquidate assets in a fire sale, locking in losses. BTFP advances provided confidence that banks would have sufficient funding to retain the securities on balance sheet. The program supported confidence among depositors that their banks would have ready access to sufficient cash to meet their needs, thus helping reduce concern that a self-fulfilling panic could cause additional bank runs.\nUsage of the BTFP was widespread across the banking sector, both in terms of actual usage and from a contingency standpoint. For example, at its peak, BTFP borrowing exceeded $160 billion, and collateral posted to the BTFP reached nearly $540 billion, suggesting that banks saw value in being prepared and having capacity to tap the facility if necessary. Over 1,800 institutions borrowed from the program, and the bulk of the borrowing was among institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. These smaller institutions took out 50 percent of loans by value and nearly 95 percent of loans by volume. Fed staff analysis showed the usage was more likely among institutions that had experienced deposit outflows, but usage was also widespread at firms that did not experience outflows. The broad-based actual and contingency use was consistent with Federal Reserve communications that the program was part of prudent liquidity management and that we encouraged all depository institutions to use the program. Now, about two weeks before all remaining outstanding BTFP loans are set to mature, the program is down to less than $200 million, and the program has experienced no losses.\n14\nOur response to the stress worked. After the announcement of the systemic risk exception and the BTFP in early March, signs of broad-based contagion subsided, and the system stabilized. While in the first two weeks of March midsize and regional banks experienced significant outflows of deposits, the acute phase of outflows had eased by the end of the month. Stability among banks that had earlier come under pressure didn't mean that every bank found its footing, but the process of dealing with balance sheet gaps was much smoother and spillovers remained contained. By the fall of that year, deposit flows had fully stabilized and midsize and regional banks saw deposit inflows on net.\nManaging Additional Stress beyond Silicon Valley and Signature Banks\nWhile the announcement of the systemic risk exception and the BTFP on March 12, 2023, helped stabilize banks in the United States, we were also continuing to manage stress in the global financial system in cooperation with relevant authorities.\nCredit Suisse, a Swiss global systemically important banking organization, had been experiencing stress over several years before March 2023, with doubts about its future viability after the Archegos Capital Management and Greensill Capital scandals had tarnished its reputation and raised doubts about its business model. Stress and outflows at Credit Suisse picked up in the fall of 2022, and we spent many months working with Swiss, European, and U.K. regulators on how to manage the growing issues, including war-gaming potential resolution scenarios. Concerns about the firm's viability accelerated on March 9, 2023, when it was forced to announce that its internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective and had been for several years. Though Credit Suisse continued to operate, it became apparent that the firm was in trouble in the week following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank.\nJust one week after SVB failed, Swiss authorities arranged for Credit Suisse to be acquired by UBS in a weekend deal that involved triggering Credit Suisse's contingent convertible capital instruments, a severe dilution of shareholders, and the removal of senior bank management, as well as emergency liquidity support and extraordinary loss sharing from the Swiss government.\n15\nIn a sense, Credit Suisse had failed very slowly over many months\u00e2\u0080\u0094even years\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then all at once.\nThe combination of these events involved coordination across U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, with careful monitoring and cooperation to identify risks to financial stability and to monitor spillovers to the U.S. and European banking systems.\nBack in the United States, we worked with our domestic counterparts as a handful of additional banks remained under pressure in the months that followed. Notably FDIC-supervised First Republic Bank was closed on May 1, 2023. First Republic had also experienced tremendous stress in March, as it suffered deposit outflows of nearly 20 percent in a single day.\n16\nFirst Republic withstood these outflows in part because of significant discount window lending, as well as the extraordinary coordination among several other banks that placed significant deposits at the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0094worth $30 billion. But over time, it became clear that First Republic's rapid and large deposit outflows and unrealized losses on loans and securities would lead to its failure as well.\n17\nWhile these were the events that got the headlines, the Federal Reserve continuously monitored other banks with potential balance sheet vulnerabilities, including those with gaps in interest rate and liquidity risk management, as well as significant exposures to office commercial real estate. We worked with these firms to ensure they addressed their vulnerabilities, whi",

Textual Analysis of Central Bank Communications\nVice Chair Philip N. Jefferson\nAt the Macroeconomics and Monetary Policy Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, San Francisco, California\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, President Daly, for organizing this conference and for the opportunity to talk to this group.\n1\nI have paid close attention to the papers presented at this annual conference in the past, and I look forward to today's presentations and discussion.\nSlide 1\nToday, I will talk about central bank communications and the use of textual analysis tools. These tools help process qualitative information that may be hard to capture in numerical forecasts. Also, they can improve our understanding of economic concepts that are otherwise difficult to measure. This topic has been covered at this conference in the past. Last year, for example, there was a paper on the program that highlighted the importance of considering the impact that speeches by the Chair of the Federal Reserve (Fed) have on asset prices when evaluating the transmission of monetary policy to the rest of the economy.\n2\nThis paper also shows that speeches by the Vice Chair are less important than those by the Chair. So this might be a good time to catch up on your text messages! (Just kidding!)\nMy\ntalk\nis organized as follows. First, I will briefly discuss central bank communication and its effect on asset prices. Next, I will discuss how recent advances in automated textual analysis may be having an impact on how the information in central bank communication is incorporated into asset prices. Then I will review how researchers and market participants use textual analysis techniques, among other techniques, to gauge who is listening to central bank communication and to understand how monetary policy is transmitted to the economy. Before concluding, I will broaden my coverage and discuss how textual analysis tools can be used to estimate difficult-to-measure concepts in economics such as uncertainty and supply chain disruptions.\nThese new textual analysis techniques are important to me as a policymaker because I want to understand how our communications are being heard, interpreted, understood, and acted upon.\nCentral Bank Communication and its Effect on Financial Markets\nFormer Fed Chair Ben Bernanke often highlighted the importance of central bank communication, saying that \"monetary policy is 98 percent talk and 2 percent action.\"\n3\nObviously, the \"98 percent\" is hyperbole; it is not meant to be taken as an exact measure of how much of the transmission of monetary policy is due to central bank communication. Even so, research and my own experience confirm that central bank communication is key for the transmission of monetary policy. In remarks I delivered almost two years ago, I discussed how monetary policy is transmitted to the rest of the economy through financial market prices.\n4\nChanges in the federal funds target range are transmitted to overnight money market rates and other short-term interest rates through arbitrage relationships. The configuration of short-term interest rates, central bank communication about the likely future path of short-term interest rates, and the associated economic outlook, in turn, affect long-term interest rates through investors' expectations.\n5\nHigher long-term interest rates increase the cost of borrowing for households and businesses, thereby affecting households' and businesses' spending, savings, and investment decisions.\nEvolution of Fed Communications\nPolicymakers' approach to communication has evolved over time. In the past, policymakers were not focused on clarity and transparency in their communications as they are today. For example, former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan famously quipped in 1987, \"If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.\"\n6\nIn the 1990s, however, he started to embrace transparency.\nFigure 1\nshows a timeline of the steps taken toward increasing transparency at the Fed since the 1990s. In 1993, the Fed started to publish Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes in their current form, and, soon after, it began releasing FOMC meeting transcripts with a five-year lag. In February 1994, the FOMC started to issue post-FOMC meeting statements following meetings at which there was a change in the intended policy stance. Later, it regularly incorporated the target federal funds rate into these statements. In May 1999, the FOMC started to publish statements after every meeting, even on occasions when there was no change in policy. In 2004, the FOMC accelerated the release of the minutes to three weeks after the meeting as opposed to after the subsequent FOMC meeting. During the tenure of former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, the Fed's transparency increased significantly. In November 2007, the FOMC began releasing the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). In 2011, Chair Bernanke started holding press conferences after every other FOMC meeting. In 2012, under his leadership, the FOMC adopted an explicit inflation target of 2 percent in its new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Also, it started publishing anonymized individual FOMC participants' views on the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate, now famously known as the \"dot plot.\" In 2019, Chair Powell continued this march toward transparency and started holding press conferences after every FOMC meeting.\nOf course, Chair Powell and other policymakers testify regularly before Congress, as required by law. Also, FOMC participants give public speeches and transparently discuss their views on monetary policy and associated issues, as evidenced by my speech here today.\nPreviously, I have spoken about two primary reasons for the increase in transparency.\n7\nFirst, transparency allows for greater accountability to the public. Second, there is a growing appreciation in the economics profession that clarity about policy actions helps the transmission of monetary policy to the rest of the economy by, for example, making asset prices more informationally efficient. Relatedly, by conveying aspects of the Fed's reaction function, communications can help inform investors' views about the likely future path of monetary policy in a way that helps achieve the Fed's monetary policy objectives.\nUsing Textual Analysis to Quantify Central Bank Communication\nCentral bank communication is clearly important in shaping the path of interest rates, so it is not surprising that investors and researchers use textual analysis techniques, including artificial intelligence, to quantify in an automated way information conveyed through FOMC statements and other communications, such as speeches by Governors and Fed Bank presidents.\n8\nResearchers have tested the hypothesis that clarity about policy actions would help the transmission of monetary policy to the rest of the economy. Using textual analysis, high-frequency asset price data, and high-frequency central bank communication data, this research shows that investors' reactions to specific sentences communicated by the central bank are quickly incorporated into asset prices.\n9\nIn addition, economists have used textual analysis to understand how media reporting of central bank communication affects short-term interest rates.\n10\nFor example, some have used a bag-of-words technique to estimate media sentiment during FOMC announcement days.\n11\nBy design, a high media sentiment is meant to capture times when journalists report that the FOMC is more likely to tighten monetary policy in the near future.\nFigure 2\nshows that the correlation between media sentiment and six-month U.S. Treasury yield changes is positive and relatively high (40 percent), which suggests that media reporting of central bank communication plays an important role in the transmission of monetary policy.\nPolicymakers know that their communications are likely to affect the course of short-term interest rates, other asset prices, and the associated economic outlook, resulting in an easing or tightening of financial conditions. Therefore, policymakers have always paid close attention to what they say, well before market participants started applying artificial intelligence tools to central bank communications.\nIn general, researchers argue that automated textual analysis and automated trading have increased the speed with which information is incorporated into asset prices. That suggests that asset prices have become more informationally efficient, sometimes in a matter of seconds or even milliseconds instead of minutes after information is released.\n12\nThus, increased transparency and advances in technology have potentially made asset prices more informationally efficient, which, in turn, helps with the transmission of monetary policy. Yet others argue that automated algorithms may be more prone to mistakes than humans, may provide an incentive for investors to value speed over accuracy, and may reduce the long-run informativeness of asset prices, which could hurt the transmission of monetary policy.\n13\nI look forward to the findings of future research as we develop a deeper understanding of this issue. For now, I do not think artificial intelligence is changing the way policymakers communicate, but research shows that it has affected how quickly information about policy is incorporated into asset prices.\nCentral Bank Communication: Is Anyone Listening?\nNext, I will discuss whether research using textual analysis is helping policymakers to understand better who is listening to central bank communication. In 2018, former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder predicted that \"central banks will keep trying to communicate with the general public, as they should. But for the most part, they will fail.\"\n14\nHe explained further that \"many economic models presume that central bank communication is aimed at wage-setters, price-setters, consumers, or investors\u00e2\u0080\u0094maybe all of them. But are they listening?\" His answer was\nno\n, they are not listening to central bank communications, and he cited economic research using survey data to support his answer.\n15\nMore recently, however, research shows that nonexperts and households\nare\nlistening to central bank communications. Some of this research uses textual analysis, and some uses randomized control trials. Researchers have used textual analysis to process automatically and quantify more than 3.2 million posts on social media by experts and nonexperts. This research shows that journalists and professional forecasters who comment often on central bank policies, as well as nonexperts who do not comment regularly on central bank policies do listen to central bank communications.\n16\nCentral Bank Communication and Monetary Policy Transmission\nFurther, research shows that direct central bank communication and the media's reporting of central bank communication are highly correlated. Yet when they do not align, the media's reporting tends to have a larger effect on asset prices and professional forecasters' views about the future than the central bank's direct communication.\n17\nIn addition, a randomized control trial with nearly 20,000 U.S. individuals shows that central bank communication affects households' inflation expectations, which, in turn, affects their behavior as measured by scanner-collected data.\n18\nThis research shows that while central bank communication tends to affect household expectations and spending behavior, the way households receive information matters. In particular, households appear to react more to information conveyed by social media, friends, and family than to information conveyed by traditional media. All told, this research suggests that central bank efforts to communicate with the general public are having some success, but there is still room for improvement.\nMeasuring Economic Concepts Using Textual Analysis\nTextual analysis is not only helping researchers understand who is listening to central bank communication. Generally, it is helping them to measure qualitative information that is hard to capture with numerical forecasts and estimate difficult-to-measure economic concepts such as uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, and financial conditions.\n19\nAs I mentioned in a previous speech, uncertainty is not directly observable in the same way that inflation and economic output are.\n20\nNotwithstanding the difficulty in measuring uncertainty, researchers have developed tools to assess it. In fact, in the past two decades, there has been tremendous growth in research devoted to the subject, especially on text-based measures of uncertainty. For example, researchers created an economic policy uncertainty index, shown in\nfigure 3\n, based on the number of leading newspaper articles that contain a combination of words related to economic policy uncertainty.\n21\nAs shown in the figure, economic uncertainty in the U.S. reached an all-time high at the onset of the pandemic, came down slightly after the pandemic, and has recently increased as the potential economic implications of new government policies are discussed in newspaper articles. Research also shows that newspaper text-based measures are highly correlated with stock price volatility, and that higher values of these measures are associated with lower investment and employment. A corollary to that insight is that policymakers should communicate as clearly as possible to avoid increasing uncertainty.\nRecent research has also discovered that narrative sentiment conveys information that may be hard to capture in numerical forecasts. For example, it was shown that the tone of text accompanying a set of economic forecasts produced by the Fed's staff, predicts forecast errors of the Fed's staff as well as Blue Chip participants.\n22\nThe predictive power of sentiment seems to be arising from signaling the downside risks to economic performance for output, employment, and stock returns. These findings suggest that the tone of the narrative captures information that is not necessarily provided by corresponding forecasts. Not surprisingly, given this information, the tonality has predictive power for stock prices as well as monetary policy surprises.\nAnother example of how textual analysis is helping researchers estimate difficult-to-measure concepts is new measures of firms' demand and supply shocks. Traditionally, academic researchers use sign restrictions in price and quantity measures to identify and differentiate demand shocks from supply shocks. An increase in price and quantity is considered a demand shock; an increase in price accompanied by a decline in quantity is considered a supply shock. These so-called sign restrictions are useful tools; however, it is possible that an increase in p",

Kugler\nAt the Whittington Lecture, McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Tom, and thank you for the invitation to give the Whittington Lecture.\n1\nIt is humbling to be here giving this lecture to honor the memory and legacy of Leslie Whittington. While I did not cross paths with Leslie here at Georgetown University, when I arrived, I heard so many stories about her contributions to the school, the university, and the students. She worked on research about the effects of economic policies on children and families, so I know that if I had had the good fortune to overlap with her as a colleague, I would have benefited greatly from her work and presence. It is also an honor to be giving this lecture, because so many dynamic leaders have previously stood before you, including some who have been inspirations to me in my career, such as Alice Rivlin and Cecilia Rouse.\nToday I will be discussing a topic that has certainly captured the attention of central bankers, and the public at large, in recent years: inflation and the relationship between inflation and unemployment. But before I talk about a lens through which to think about the inflation experienced in the pandemic period, I want to update you with my views on the current outlook for the U.S. economy and the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) efforts to sustainably return inflation to our 2 percent objective while maintaining a strong labor market.\nEconomic Outlook\nThe overall picture is that the U.S. economy remains on a firm footing, with output growing at a solid pace. Real gross domestic product grew 2.5 percent in 2024. Consumer spending continued to drive this solid pace last year. While retail sales posted a decline last month, January data are often difficult to interpret. Bad weather and seasonal adjustment difficulties may have affected the release, and it should be noted the slowdown came after a strong pace of sales in the second half of last year. That said, as usual, I pay attention to many indicators to gauge the state of the economy. Employment readings show that the labor market is healthy and stable. Payroll job gains have been solid recently, averaging 189,000 per month over the past four months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). After touching 4.2 percent as recently as November, the unemployment rate has flattened to 4 percent since then, consistent with a labor market that is neither weakening nor showing signs of overheating.\nInflation has fallen significantly since its peak in the middle of 2022, though the path continues to be bumpy and inflation remains somewhat elevated. Readings last week from the BLS showed price pressures persisted in the economy in January. Our preferred inflation gauge at the Fed, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, will be released next week. Based on the consumer price index and producer price index data for January, it is estimated that the PCE index advanced about 2.4 percent on a 12-month basis in January. Excluding food and energy costs, core prices are estimated to have risen 2.6 percent. Those readings show there is still some way to go before achieving the FOMC's 2 percent objective.\nRegarding monetary policy, the FOMC judged in September that it was time to begin reducing our policy interest rate from levels that were strongly restrictive on aggregate demand and putting downward pressure on inflation. We reduced that rate 100 basis points through December, leaving our policy rate at moderately restrictive levels. At our latest meeting in January, I supported the decision to hold the policy rate steady. I see this as appropriate, given that the downward risks to employment have diminished but upside risks to inflation remain. The potential net effect of new economic policies also remains highly uncertain and will depend on the breadth, duration, reactions to, and, importantly, specifics of the measures adopted.\nGoing forward, in considering the appropriate federal funds rate, we will watch these developments closely and continue to carefully assess the incoming data and evolving outlook.\nNow, turning back to the main topic of my speech, I will start with the core mission of the Federal Reserve: to pursue the dual mandate, given to us by Congress, of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. We saw firsthand during the pandemic period why the price-stability portion of the mandate is so important. High inflation imposes significant hardship and erodes Americans' purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. As a policymaker and economist, I think it is vitally important to have a good understanding of inflation dynamics and how those dynamics may have evolved over time. This knowledge allows me to pursue the best policies to deliver stable prices while maintaining a solid labor market.\nWaves of Inflation\nFive years after the pandemic took hold suddenly and with little warning, there is a tendency to remember the inflation buildup as a fast and uniform phenomenon. But that was not the case. Inflation stemming from the pandemic shock came in waves. Today I will first describe the different waves of inflation experienced in the pandemic period. Then I invite you aboard the sailboat that we will use to navigate those waves: You could call it the SS\nPhillips Curve.\nThe Phillips curve is a model that has been used for a long time to try to explain inflation dynamics and the tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment. Finally, I will discuss with you how this voyage may have changed the charts for policymakers.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S., and much of the world's developed economies, experienced a prolonged period of low inflation. Then, when the economy broadly shut down in March and April 2020, the U.S. experienced a brief period of deflation. But by the middle of that year, we saw that the first of several waves of inflation began hitting the economy's shores.\nThe first notable wave of inflation came from food prices. With many restaurants closed and people fearful of gathering, consumers pivoted their spending to grocery stores and online grocery delivery to meet their families' needs, with some stockpiling essential items because they feared future shortages. This jump in demand was met with snarled supply chains for food processing and groceries. Annual food inflation reached a first peak of 5 percent in June 2020. There was a second food inflation wave with the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in the middle of 2022. Beyond the cost alone, grocery prices are an important determinant of inflation expectations for consumers since food is purchased so frequently.\n2\nAnother wave of inflation came from goods other than food and energy\u00e2\u0080\u0094what economists call \"core goods.\" In the years immediately before the pandemic, goods prices were not a significant source of inflation. During the expansion from 2009 until 2020, core goods inflation declined 0.5 percent annually on average. However, once the pandemic took hold, consumer demand rotated from services to goods. At the same time, additional supply chain issues arose, including closed factories and disrupted ports. As consumption rapidly shifted toward goods, their prices rose sharply.\n3\nCore goods inflation picked up markedly in the spring of 2021 and reached a peak of 7.6 percent on a 12-month basis in February 2022. This was a notable development because, during most of this century, goods price deflation offset price increases in other categories and thus kept a lid on overall inflation.\nA third wave of inflation came from services costs, excluding housing. Near the start of the pandemic, millions of Americans lost their jobs, and many left the labor market, with some retiring and others fearful of being exposed to the virus. When the economy began to reopen from shutdowns, demand for workers rose faster than the supply. As a result, the labor market quickly became very tight. To attract workers, employers raised wages. And to offset that expense, many raised prices. Given that labor is the most important input into the production of services, core services inflation ensued, reaching a peak of 5.2 percent on a 12-month basis in December 2021. Core services inflation stayed persistently high until it began to turn down in February 2023.\nThe final wave of inflation I will discuss came from PCE housing services inflation. During the pandemic, many Americans reassessed housing choices, including those who preferred to move to detached homes in the suburbs from multifamily dwellings in cities. The supply of housing has long been constrained, so when a further increase in demand met limited supply, prices rose. Housing inflation rose to a peak of 8.27 percent on a 12-month basis in April 2023 and has moved lower since then. The run-up in housing inflation came more slowly, but it is also the component most slowly to abate. This is an area that experienced catch-up inflation, as housing inflation rises and falls slowly because rents are reset infrequently, usually only once a year for most renters.\nFor the remainder of this discussion, I will focus on core inflation, and specifically core goods and core services inflation. My objective is to discuss several additions to an augmented Phillips curve model that allow us to capture the dynamics of those waves we encountered on our journey.\nThe Traditional Phillips Curve\nSince price stability and maximum employment are the two components of the Fed's dual-mandate goal, it is important for policymakers to be able to interpret the inflation process and relate it to macroeconomic conditions, including unemployment. One traditional way of understanding the usual tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is the use of the Phillips curve. It was first employed by New Zealand economist A.W. Phillips in 1958 to describe a simple relationship between wage growth and unemployment. Basically, it demonstrates that wage inflation is lower when unemployment is high, and higher when unemployment is low. Since then, several variants and updates have been offered to the Phillips curve model, and I will offer updates, too.\nOne of the most notable updates came from Milton Friedman in 1967 in his presidential address to the American Economic Association.\n4\nIn that speech, he argued that there is only a temporary tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, because inflation depends on both the unemployment rate relative to a natural rate (the unemployment gap) and expectations of future inflation.\nThe unemployment gap measures how much unemployment is above or below some reference level such as the natural rate of unemployment, or NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment), which is thought to be the normal level of unemployment absent cyclical forces. An unemployment rate that is above the reference level\nindicates that there is slack in the economy. Conversely, if the unemployment rate is below the reference level, the economy is tight. The unemployment gap has an inverse relation to wage and price inflation, because slack in the economy means that there are excess resources to meet demand while tightness in the labor market means there is little room to expand demand without putting upward pressure on prices. Let's turn now to the other ingredient in Friedman's Phillips curve: inflation expectations. Inflation expectations represent the rate at which people expect prices to rise in the future. A Phillips curve model that includes inflation expectations is called an \"expectations-augmented Phillips curve.\"\nThe idea behind adding inflation expectations to a Phillips curve is that workers care about their inflation-adjusted wage, rather than nominal wages, over the course of a period of employment when bargaining their pay. Meanwhile, price-setting firms care about their relative price in pricing their products. Both sets of agents must forecast as best as possible the future path of inflation to efficiently bargain their wages or set their prices. In other words, both parties form expectations about the general price level, and these expectations will feed back into the inflation process.\n5\nFriedman assumed that inflation expectations respond to lagged observed inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094or what are called \"adaptive expectations\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094and when that is so, it provides a mechanism for inflation to be persistent.\nThis view captured inflation dynamics in the 1970s and early 1980s fairly well; however, it was not broadly applicable to the period from the late 1980s through 2019, often called the \"Great Moderation.\" Rather, regarding inflation dynamics over an extended period, inflation appears to be more strongly related to long-run inflation expectations than to lagged inflation or short-run inflation expectations measures. Monetary policy can play an important role in setting long-run inflation expectations. Both wage seekers and price setters form their inflation expectations, in part, from their beliefs about the central bank's inflation goal. When long-run inflation expectations stay close to the central bank's goal, we say that inflation expectations are anchored at that goal. That goal is currently set at 2 percent, and long-run inflation expectations have indeed been in a tight range around that target.\n6\nThe empirical literature on the Phillips curve has considered additional variables that may affect inflation and used those variables to create new versions of a Phillips curve. For example, Phillips curves have long included measures of \"cost-push\" pressures such as core import prices. These cost pressures more fully capture shocks to firms' costs coming from global price pressures and not captured by other measures of slack. Other Phillips curves also include lags of inflation to capture persistence in the inflation process.\n7\nTo summarize, the empirical literature has come to the conclusion that inflation dynamics can best be captured by a Phillips curve that includes lags of inflation, long-run inflation expectations, and a measure of slack, as well as import and energy prices as cost-push shocks. An instance of that formulation of a Phillips curve is included in former Chair Janet Yellen's speech from 2015.\n8\nNext, I would like to assess the accuracy of this baseline model during the recent run-up of inflation and consider how to augment the Phillips curve model with some new variables that may be able to capture some of the shocks experienced during the pandemic and post-pandemic period. A large literature has emerged on how to interpret the recent run-up in inflation, and more",

Barr\nAt Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nBanks play an indispensable role in an economy that works for everyone.\n1\nThey enable households to borrow to buy a home, save for the future, and deal with the ups and downs of managing finances. Banks provide the credit for businesses to smooth out income and expenses, supply capital to seize new opportunities and create jobs, and facilitate the flow of payments that are the lifeblood of our economy. And banks borrow from households and businesses as well, such as through federally insured deposits. Because of these vital roles, we need to make sure that banks are resilient and serve as a source of strength to the economy in both good times and when the financial system comes under stress. In our market economy, like any business, banks compete with each other and pursue profits by balancing risk-taking with safety and soundness. But because of the key role banks play in the economy, and the fact that banks do not fully internalize the costs of their own failure, regulation and supervision must ensure that banks do not take on excessive risks that can cause widespread harm to households and businesses.\nBank failures are as old as banking, and we've seen repeated waves of bank failures over the centuries. America learned that hard lesson nearly 100 years ago, when bank failures played a central role in the Great Depression. In response, the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0094and many other countries around the globe\u00e2\u0080\u0094set up a system of deposit insurance and enabled emergency lending in times of stress. To balance the moral hazard of the federal safety net, Congress established a framework of regulation and supervision to make it more likely that banks internalize the costs to society of their risk-taking.\nBut finance is always evolving, and the buildup of new risks led to the banking crisis of the 1980s, and then to the Global Financial Crisis, with devastating consequences. Weaknesses that were revealed in regulation and supervision led to unprecedented and unpopular bailouts, and shuttered American businesses, devastated local communities with foreclosures, and millions of individuals lost their jobs and their livelihoods. Government responded in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and in regulatory reforms by significantly strengthening bank oversight to curb excessive risk-taking. The message from the American people was clear: risk-taking must be balanced with the overarching need to maintain a resilient banking system that can continue to play its crucial role for households and businesses in good times and in bad.\nAnother, perennial lesson from the history of bank regulation and supervision is that the job is never done, and that the constant evolution of finance means risks will also evolve. As Vice Chair for Supervision, I have recognized the need to approach this mission with humility, aware that I don't have all the answers or perfect foresight of where things can go wrong. Both regulators and banks are limited in our ability to comprehensively identify and measure risks. Our financial system is complex, interconnected, and evolving. We cannot fully appreciate how a specific vulnerability can interact with other vulnerabilities to amplify and propagate risk in the face of shocks, let alone accurately anticipate shocks in time to avoid them.\nWhen I became Vice Chair for Supervision in July 2022, the Global Financial Crisis was almost 15 years past, and much had been done to strengthen the resilience of the system to reflect lessons learned. But in March 2023, we experienced the second largest bank failure in history, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and the subsequent failures of Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. SVB's failure triggered stress throughout the system and required the issuance of a systemic risk exemption and the creation of an emergency bank lending program.\n2\nWe have made some progress toward addressing the gaps that led to the failures. But there will be headwinds that we must guard against in the coming years, as well as ongoing vulnerabilities and areas of risk that require continued vigilance.\nEarlier this year, I announced I would step down as Vice Chair for Supervision but remain a member of the Board of Governors. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as vice chair for supervision, and to work with colleagues to help maintain the stability and strength of the U.S. financial system so that it can meet the needs of households and businesses. I've determined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as governor. In this role, I'll continue to participate in monetary policy deliberations and vote on matters before the Board, including those related to supervision and regulation.\nWhile it was a tough decision to make, I believe it was the right decision for the institution and, more importantly, for the public, whom we serve. The risk of a dispute over my position would be a distraction from our important mission. I feel strongly\u00e2\u0080\u0094as Chair Powell has said publicly many times\u00e2\u0080\u0094that the independence of the Federal Reserve is critical to our ability to meet our statutory mandates and serve the American public. Put simply, our mission is too important to let such a dispute distract from doing our job for the American people.\nSince my term for Vice Chair for Supervision will end later this month, I'd like to use one of my last opportunities as Vice Chair to discuss seven specific risks ahead: (1) maintaining and finishing post-financial crisis reforms; (2) maintaining the credibility of the stress test; (3) maintaining credible, consistent supervision; (4) encouraging responsible innovation; (5) addressing cyber and third-party risk; (6) risks in the nonbank sector; and (7) climate risk. Each will continue to be a risk in either the near- or long-term.\nMaintaining and Finishing Post-Financial Crisis Reforms\nThere is always push back on financial regulation. I felt that even in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, as I helped to draft the legislative response to that crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act.\n3\nAnd I felt that over the last few years as we worked to finish the job of post-crisis financial reform and take up evolving threats revealed from the latest bank stress. It is important to get the balance right, but it is also important to stand up for the American people.\nI urge regulators to finish the job of implementing the final plank of the Global Financial Crisis reforms\u00e2\u0080\u0094and not to dismantle the hard-fought resilience that banks have built up in the process. Of course, there are always ways to increase efficiency and reform prior methods without costs to resiliency, and I support those efforts. But as I've spoken about many times, capital is critical to absorb losses and enable banks to continue operations through times of stress, and capital requirements should be aligned with the risks that banks take.\n4\nThe Basel III endgame reforms include many improvements to how we measure credit, trading, operational, and derivatives risks in light of our experience in the Global Financial Crisis. All major jurisdictions except the United States have finalized rules that would implement these standards for their internationally active banks.\nThe Federal Reserve played a central role in developing these standards in the many years before my arrival as Vice Chair. The Board sought comment on a proposal in July 2023 to implement the Basel III reforms, and we received a wide range of comments on the proposal.\n5\nOn the basis of those comments, I took steps last fall to outline broad and material changes that would better balance the benefits and costs of capital in light of comments received and would result in a capital framework that appropriately reflects the risks of banks.\n6\nThese reforms had broad consensus on the Board and the support of the heads of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nWhen the U.S. provides leadership in international forums like Basel and then follows through, we set a powerful example and establish a standard that other jurisdictions also uphold. Implementing international standards enables U.S. firms to compete on a level playing field across the globe and makes the system safer. When we don't follow through on our commitments, for whatever reason, concerns about a level playing field rise in other jurisdictions, in an international \"race to the bottom\" on standards. This harms us all and makes U.S. banks less competitive. And unless the U.S. implements these standards, other jurisdictions will force U.S. banks operating abroad to meet their standards instead.\nLet me turn to unfinished business from the March 2023 banking stress. In that event, we learned that bank runs and bank failures can happen fast, much faster than before. Before SVB, the largest bank to fail did so over a period of several weeks. The deposit losses experienced by SVB were much greater in both relative and absolute terms, and they occurred in less than 24 hours.\n7\nOver the past two years, the Federal Reserve has worked with banks to improve their ability to borrow from the discount window, and the financial system's collective readiness has improved significantly compared to pre-SVB, including with a substantial increase of $1 trillion in collateral pledged across the system.\n8\nThe Federal Reserve has also worked to improve the functioning of the discount window, through a concerted effort to gather public input and identify areas for modernization. These efforts have improved the ability of banks to weather stress, both individually and collectively, which enhances financial stability.\nHowever, there is still more work to do. For instance, banks, even the largest banks, are not currently required to establish a minimum level of readiness at the window, and, as a result, there are outlier firms that are not prepared for stress. This needs to change. Without a requirement there is also a significant risk of backtracking on the substantial progress in readiness we have made since March 2023.\nAnother important lesson from SVB is a classic one: balance sheet vulnerabilities among a group of institutions can be a source of contagion for the financial system and thus a key stability risk. While we did much to improve the resilience of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) in the past decade, March 2023 showed that significant systemic risks can develop and spread from stress anywhere in the system, including in large and regional banks that are not G-SIBs.\n9\nThe resilience of these firms has improved as they have recognized their vulnerabilities, and we have worked through supervisory channels to encourage risk-management practices that put them on a firmer footing. But we also need to put in place more durable solutions to address risks. For one, the level of capital held by large banks needs to align with the underlying risks on their balance sheets. One important step would be to finalize the requirement that all large firms reflect unrealized losses on available for sale securities in their capital, which is a reform with broad agreement. This will help them manage interest rate risk before it gets to extreme levels, a significant problem revealed in the banking stress of two years ago.\nAnother lesson from the spring of 2023 is that large and regional banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as G-SIBs\u00e2\u0080\u0094should ensure that they can actually monetize the securities on which they rely for their liquidity. Why does this matter? Banks need to be able to turn a portion of their assets into cash with a speed sufficient to meet outflows when uninsured depositors or other short-term creditors demand it. Regulation needs to reflect realistic assumptions about monetization.\nWe should also consider updating some assumptions about deposit outflows in our liquidity requirements so that they better align with observed stress behavior. During the stress in 2023, we saw uninsured deposits from high-net worth individuals and certain entities, such as venture capital firms, behave more like highly sophisticated financial counterparties than nonfinancial companies or ordinary retail depositors, which is how they are generally treated in regulations.\n10\nThis mis-measured risk of deposit outflows means banks may not have sufficient liquidity to manage a stress period.\nIn a related vein, banks have stepped up their use of reciprocal deposit arrangements\u00e2\u0080\u0094arrangements where deposits are spread across many banks within a network\u00e2\u0080\u0094as a way to manage the risk of deposit amounts over $250,000.\n11\nWhile this arrangement spreads risk across the banking system, it is a strategy that has not been tested in a large-scale stress event. It is only logical to wonder how the attenuation of relationships between customers and banks under reciprocal arrangements will affect the behavior of depositors worried about a bank run. We also need to be attentive to operational risks in these arrangements, as well as the risk-management capacity of these companies to manage these relationships under stress.\nA final lesson from the bank stress two years ago is that we need to do more to ensure that all banks that come under stress can be resolved in an orderly fashion. One way to do this would be to require all large banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094including those that are not G-SIBS\u00e2\u0080\u0094to issue certain amounts of long-term debt. This would have helped reassure depositors worried about the stability of bank funding and aided in the eventual resolution of at least some of the banks that came under stress in 2023. The banking agencies have proposed a rule on long-term debt requirements, we have received many helpful comments that led us to adjust it in draft form, and I support moving forward to finalize it with those adjustments.\n12\nAs I mentioned, revised Basel III standards, revised long-term debt requirements, and to-be-proposed liquidity standards would help to address gaps in our current framework, and I continue to believe that they should move forward.\nMoreover, banks and supervisors should also stay vigilant to known risks in the current environment. For instance, risks remain in the commercial real estate market, particularly within the office segment, as borrowers may find it difficult to refinance maturing loans. And interest rate risk, especially for those with high levels of uninsured deposits, remains a key area of focus.\nMaintain the Credibility of the Stress Test\nWe face a challenging environment with the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. The stress tests helped the financial sector emerge from the Global Fina",

Jefferson\nAt the Martin H. Crego Lecture in Economics, Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Professor Ho for that kind introduction and for the opportunity to talk to the Vassar community.\n1\nI am happy to be back on campus. As a teenager in Washington, D.C., I had the very good fortune that a high school counselor pushed me to apply to Vassar College. I was accepted, and I earned my bachelor's degree here. Attending Vassar opened a wider variety of opportunities to me than I would have otherwise had available. But I encountered one problem: Vassar did not offer any banking or business courses, which is what I wanted to study. So, I enrolled in an economics class, figuring it was the next best thing. I was hooked, and I have been studying economics ever since.\nSlide 1\nMy time here as a student was transformative, and I was honored to have served on Vassar's board from 2002 to 2022. Vassar is a vibrant intellectual community.\nTo motivate the\ntopic\nof today's speech, let me begin by sharing with you briefly my assessment of the current state of the U.S. economy. The performance of the U.S. economy has been quite strong overall.\n2\nLast year, gross domestic product grew at a solid pace of 2.5 percent. I see the labor market as being in a solid position, with job creation steady and the unemployment rate at 4 percent in January. Inflation has come down a great deal over the past two and a half years but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent target. Based on recently released data, it is estimated that the 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures price index was 2.4 percent in January. Progress toward our 2 percent objective has been slow in the past year. I expect the path of inflation to continue to be bumpy. While a cumulative cut in the policy rate by 100 basis points last year has brought the stance of monetary policy closer to a neutral setting, monetary policy continues to be restrictive. I believe that, with a strong economy and a solid labor market, we can take our time to assess the incoming data to make any further adjustments to our policy rate.\nHousehold consumption grew by 3.2 percent over last year. Understanding the causes of the continued robustness in consumer spending is important because it accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity. Therefore, any accurate forecast of future economic activity would need to get the growth in consumer spending right.\nToday, I will discuss one important factor behind the recent strength in consumer spending: households' balance sheets\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, their assets, such as stocks, bank accounts, and houses, and their liabilities, such as mortgages, car loans, and other forms of borrowing. At first glance, households appear to be in a strong financial position. Overall, American households currently possess a very high level of wealth that is driven by elevated house values, relatively low overall debt levels, and a strong stock market.\nAsset performance and the amount of debt, however, explain only part of the picture. The health of household finances also depends on the cost of new and existing debt and the availability of credit. Household balance sheets are an important factor behind the recent strength in consumer spending. That said, some households may have a difficult time weathering unexpected costs or economic shocks. Looking at a variety of indicators across the income distribution shows that, while, in aggregate, household balance sheets are indeed strong, low- and middle-income households, and those with lower credit scores, may be stretched.\nThe remainder of my talk is organized as follows. I will begin by discussing household wealth, both in aggregate and across the distribution of income. Then, I connect elevated wealth to recent spending patterns. After that, I discuss the assets side of household balance sheets. Then, I turn to liabilities, including the cost of servicing debt. Next, I discuss households' ability to get new credit and the cost of such credit. Before concluding, I discuss the role of households' balance sheets in the transmission of monetary policy.\nOverall Household Wealth and Its Implications for Spending\nLet me now turn to the overall picture of household wealth.\nFigure 1\nshows a stylized household balance sheet, with assets on the left and liabilities on the right. Net worth, also called wealth, is the difference between the two sides of the balance sheet\u00e2\u0080\u0094assets less liabilities\u00e2\u0080\u0094and it is a key indicator of households' financial health. Relative to income, households' net worth is near its highest level in the past 30 years. Total net worth in the U.S. was over $50 trillion higher in the third quarter of last year than it was at the end of 2019. After one accounts for inflation, this accumulation represents an increase in overall wealth of about 20 percent for U.S. households, as shown by the solid black line in\nfigure 2\n.\nThese recent gains in household net worth have been broad based across the income distribution. The net worth of low- and middle-income households\u00e2\u0080\u0094defined as the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution and shown by the dashed red line\u00e2\u0080\u0094has increased in line with aggregate net worth.\n3\nAlthough these households account for 25 percent of total consumption, which is less than their population share, they are still key to the performance of the economy overall.\nLet me now turn to the implications of household net worth for our understanding of the recent strength in spending.\nFigure 3\nshows the saving rate, which measures the share of disposable income\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, income after taxes and government transfers\u00e2\u0080\u0094that households save rather than spend. The saving rate has fluctuated widely over the past few years. It rose during the pandemic, as many households received supplementary income support from the government and some cut back on spending. Then, households spent some of the savings that they had accumulated during the pandemic, leading the saving rate to fall to a relatively low level in 2022. The saving rate has recovered somewhat since then. Now, it hovers around 1 to 1.5 percentage points below its level before the pandemic, indicating that households are still spending more of their income than usual. It seems likely that elevated household wealth helps explain this higher-than-usual spending.\nOverall spending has been elevated, but how has high consumption been spread across the income distribution? Recent research shows that the spending of low- and middle-income households has lagged that of higher-income households over the past few years.\n4\nAs shown in\nfigure 4\n, although real retail spending growth moved similarly for all households before the pandemic, it has diverged since the middle of 2021. Since then, spending for low-income households moved roughly sideways until the middle of last year, when it began to grow again. High-income households' consumption, by contrast, has grown more consistently over this period.\nAssets\nHaving discussed net worth and its implications for spending, now I drill down into the two components of net worth\u00e2\u0080\u0094household assets and liabilities. With regard to the asset side, elevated net worth largely reflects gains in two important asset categories: stock market holdings and real estate. Each category accounts for roughly one-fourth of households' assets. The stock market valuation has increased at a very rapid pace over the past five years, leading to a $20 trillion rise in the value of households' stock portfolios. As house prices rose, the value of households' real estate has also increased by about the same amount.\nReal estate is a particularly important source of wealth for low- and middle-income households, comprising 40 percent of their net worth. Therefore, the growth in real estate wealth over the past five years accounts for a very significant share\u00e2\u0080\u0094over half\u00e2\u0080\u0094of the increase in these households' overall wealth. That said, many low-income households do not own their home, and so they did not benefit from the growth in house prices. Equities comprise a smaller share of these households' wealth, and so they account for only around 10 percent of the increase in their wealth.\nWealth allows households to weather unexpected shocks, such as the loss of a job or a surprise bill; however, not all forms of wealth are quickly and easily accessible in case of such emergencies. It can be expensive for households to access the equity that they have in their homes. Also, much of households' stock holdings are in retirement accounts that are difficult to liquidate. So, to understand how resilient households' financial situations are, I also pay close attention to the most liquid components of their net worth, which include bank deposits and money market mutual funds. As the solid black line in\nfigure 5\nshows, in aggregate, households hold about 20 percent more of these liquid assets than they did before the pandemic. As the dashed red line shows, in contrast to the aggregate, low- and middle-income households have a slightly smaller liquid asset buffer than they did before the pandemic. This smaller buffer suggests that some of these households may not be as equipped to handle economic shocks as they were five years ago. That said, low- and middle-income households still hold more of these assets than they did 10 years ago, when many of them were still recovering from the Great Recession.\nOn the whole, the asset side of households' balance sheets paints a very healthy picture of their financial positions. Rising house and equity prices have increased net worth for households across the income distribution, and elevated asset valuations seem to help explain strong consumption growth last year.\nLiabilities\nLet me now turn to household liabilities\u00e2\u0080\u0094what households owe to their lenders.\nFigure 6\nplots three major categories of household debt relative to disposable personal income.\n5\nYou see home mortgages, the largest share, at the bottom in blue; consumer credit, which includes credit cards, auto loans, student loans in orange; and other consumer loans in beige.\n6\nTotal household debt rose through the 2000s and peaked around the time of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007 to 2009. It then began a slow decline as households \"deleveraged.\" The evolution of total debt is driven by mortgage debt, which currently accounts for about 60 percent of total household debt. Mortgage debt levels remain relatively subdued after rising somewhat during the COVID-19 pandemic, partly due to increasing home prices leading borrowers to take out larger loans.\nFigure 7\nzooms in on revolving credit\u00e2\u0080\u0094largely, credit card balances\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is part of the previous \"consumer credit\" category.\n7\nBalances were at about 7 percent of disposable income until the COVID-19 pandemic. Households reduced their spending\u00e2\u0080\u0094decreasing the need for credit card debt\u00e2\u0080\u0094and in part used income support programs to pay down existing credit card debt. The result was a nearly 3 percentage point drop in revolving credit relative to disposable personal income. As consumer spending rose and households began to take on more credit card debt, this ratio began to rebound in 2021 but remains about 1 percentage point below its pre-pandemic levels.\nAlthough levels of debt may be low, how costly is it for households to remain current on that debt?\nFigure 8\nplots the debt service ratio, which is the amount of required debt payments relative to disposable personal income.\n8\nAlong with the fall in debt to which I just referred, this ratio plummeted during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has since risen, but it remains about 1 percentage point below its pre-pandemic level. That said, interest payments on revolving debt, which excludes mortgages, have risen over the past few years. The share of disposable personal income going to pay this interest rate is now slightly higher than it was just before the pandemic.\nCredit Availability and Costs\nSo far, I have discussed households' current debt liabilities and how households are able to manage their current debt payments. Even households with elevated levels of assets may wish to obtain new credit. Policymakers and economists often ask, how easy is it for households, in general, to increase their borrowing, and at what cost?\nLenders consider a range of factors in determining whether to supply credit and how much credit to extend. One key factor is the borrower's \"credit risk score.\" These scores, which are calculated by private companies, use information on individuals' past payment behavior and a variety of other factors to create a number that is predictive of their ability to repay debt.\nFigure 9\nplots the fraction of individuals with credit risk scores in the subprime, near-prime, and prime categories since 2014. There has been a gradual increase in the fraction of borrowers with prime scores, in part reflecting the deleveraging that I referred to earlier, which is mirrored by the decline in the fraction with subprime scores. As you can see, the fraction of subprime scores took a sharp turn downward at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, many people were able to use the pandemic-era income support programs to become current on their debt and otherwise boost their scores into near-prime and prime categories. This \"credit score migration\" helped many individuals obtain credit.\n9\nBefore obtaining new credit, people may first turn to lines of credit that they already have\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, credit cards.\nFigure 10\nplots \"utilization rates\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094the ratio of credit card balances to credit limits\u00e2\u0080\u0094for subprime, near-prime, and prime consumers. Utilization rates fell for all three groups at the beginning of the pandemic but have risen since then and are now somewhat above their pre-pandemic levels for both subprime and near-prime borrowers. These groups may be reluctant to draw down their credit lines further.\nIt can be challenging to determine the availability of new credit. While the total amount of credit that people have and their new borrowing can be observed, these quantities are determined both by lenders' willingness to supply credit and borrowers' demand for credit. Borrowers taking out fewer new loans may be due to a reduced supply of credit, lower demand for credit, or a combination of the two. Sometimes, however, one of these factors can be identified. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, reductions in household spending and increases in income support programs likely reduced the demand for credit, contributing to the decline in debt levels during that period.\nA more systematic method that we have used at the Federal Reserve to help disen",

Barr\nAt the Council on Foreign Relations, New York, New York\nShare\nWatch Live\nAdvances in artificial intelligence (AI) have accelerated rapidly over the past few years.\n1\nIt is now commonplace to see autonomous vehicles navigating city streets, and generative AI tools are available on phones and other devices wherever we go. AI innovations make headlines and play a big role in financial markets, and generative AI has the potential to change how we think about productivity, labor markets and the macroeconomy.\n2\nToday, I will address that question by outlining two hypothetical scenarios for AI's impact and the implications for businesses, regulators, and society. I will focus my comments on Generative AI, or GenAI, a subset of AI that has seen significant growth and integration into economic activity in just a few short years.\nGenAI and Its Adoption\nCompared to earlier iterations of AI, GenAI is able to generate content, which allows it to significantly enhance productivity across a range of knowledge-based activities and be used by people without coding skills. GenAI will likely become a \"general purpose technology,\" with widespread adoption, continuous improvement, and productivity enhancements to a wide range of sectors across the economy. We are already seeing GenAI improve the productivity of its own R&D.\n3\nThere is widespread enthusiasm for GenAI, and survey evidence shows much faster rates of consumer adoption of GenAI already than were seen for the personal computer or the internet.\n4\nWhile actual deployment of GenAI is limited to some business functions, and there have been pitfalls along the way, businesses in almost every sector are experimenting with or considering how to make use of the technology.\n5\nFirms are also exploring Agentic AI\u00e2\u0080\u0094Gen AI systems that not only produce new content, but are also able to proactively pursue goals by generating innovative solutions and acting upon them at speed and scale.\n6\nImagining Agentic AI's ultimate application, some speculate that we could experience a \"country of geniuses in a data center\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094a collective intelligence that surpasses human capabilities in problem-solving and collaboration.\n7\nSome believe Agentic AI has the potential to connect ideas in disparate domains, potentially transforming research and development and society more broadly.\n8\nHypothetical Scenarios Considering How GenAI Could Evolve\nToday, I will outline two hypothetical scenarios for considering how GenAI could evolve.\n9\nIn one, we see only incremental adoption that primarily augments what humans do today, but still leads to widespread productivity gains. In the other, we see transformative change where we extend human capabilities with far-reaching consequences. For each scenario, I consider the potential implications for the economy and financial sector.\nThinking through hypothetical scenarios can help widen our lens to a range of possible outcomes and provide a framework for assessing the balance between benefits and risks. Scenarios are not predictions of the future, but provide a framework for analyzing the factors that could lead to different outcomes. Reality is complex. GenAI adoption rates will vary across industries, leading to diverse impacts on market structures. Elements of both scenarios will likely come to pass, and play out at different rates, which will influence the effects on the economy and society. In the short term, GenAI may be overhyped, while in the long run, it may be underappreciated. And, of course, things might turn out differently from these hypotheticals.\nHypothetical 1: Incremental Progress with Widespread Productivity Gains\nFirst, let me begin with the incremental scenario, where GenAI primarily augments work in existing processes and leads to steady and widespread productivity gains, but does not fundamentally unlock new capabilities or transform the economy.\nIn this state of the world, GenAI tools enhance efficiency and enable more personalized solutions across industries, in ways that have incremental\u00e2\u0080\u0094but still meaningful\u00e2\u0080\u0094effects on people's lives. For instance, in customer service, professional writing\u00e2\u0080\u0094but not this speech\u00e2\u0080\u0094and software engineering, GenAI-powered tools are already supporting workers, improving accuracy and speed, and these effects could spread to other sectors.\n10\nIn this world, health care sees significant improvements as GenAI reduces administrative burdens, assists with diagnostics, and personalizes treatment plans based on real-time patient data. Medicines and other treatments are developed at a faster pace.\n11\nEducation is similarly affected, as GenAI alleviates administrative tasks for teachers, allows lessons to be tailored to individual students, and permits students to learn by doing.\n12\nIn manufacturing, GenAI-optimized supply chains anticipate and adjust more quickly to disruptions, and current manufacturing processes are refined through virtual iteration.\n13\nIn materials science, GenAI-driven experimentation accelerates the discovery of new materials, leading to advances in everything from construction to electronics.\n14\nTurning to the financial sector, we could see similar productivity gains. Community banks leverage GenAI-powered chatbots to provide customized financial advice rooted in local knowledge, while institutions of all sizes continue to advance use of GenAI for compliance monitoring, fraud detection, risk management, and document analysis.\n15\nThe impact to society would be incrementally positive in this state of the world. Humans would use GenAI as a tool to deliver goods and services that we currently produce in a more efficient way. Productivity would go up. The economy would grow at a faster pace.\n16\nWhat does this mean for the labor force? The impact will depend on the industry and the nature of the job. GenAI experiments suggest the technology holds the promise of levelling up skills and bringing productivity of lower-performing workers into line with higher performing workers.\n17\nIn other cases, it could augment the highest performers, leaving them more time for creativity or strategic aspects of their roles. Increasing automation for certain tasks may displace some workers, where certain skills can be replicated by GenAI. Historically, as technology has replaced some jobs, it has augmented existing roles or created new ones.\n18\nHowever, this is not to downplay the individual cost for workers who need to retrain, find other employment, or change careers in response to major changes in labor demand. Society will need to account for these possible effects of AI.\nWhat does this mean for the economy? As I noted before, the economy should grow, if the incremental productivity gains are widespread. However, in this scenario, it is possible that the expected value creation from GenAI was overhyped, anticipating transformative breakthroughs rather than incremental productivity gains. This could trigger market corrections for the firms that have heavily invested in this technology if reality doesn't measure up to expectations. While the U.S. economy experienced a surge of productivity growth during the dot.com boom in the late 1990s, it was followed by a wave of bankruptcies, capital overhang, and a cautious business investment climate.\n19\nThe effects of the ensuing recession were widespread.\nWhat does this mean for financial stability and other financial risks? In this incremental scenario, GenAI may magnify both the vulnerabilities and sources of resilience that already exist in the system. Attractive trades become more crowded, but risk managers gain new insights.\n20\nMalicious actors gain new tools, but cyber defenders become better armed. So long as financial regulators, enterprise risk managers, and others charged with managing downside risks prioritize efforts to keep pace with the evolving financial ecosystem, there's nothing to suggest a wholesale transformation of the balance of risks. Of course, keeping pace will pose challenges, and it's important that we all focus on the need to meet these risks.\nHypothetical Scenario 2: Transformative Change\nNow, let's consider a more dramatic hypothetical scenario, in which GenAI adoption extends beyond improving on what we currently do, and provides new expertise and capabilities that have transformative effects on the economy and society. In this scenario, humans deploy their imagination and creativity\u00e2\u0080\u0094combined with robust investment in research and development\u00e2\u0080\u0094to deploy intelligent GenAI systems to make rapid breakthroughs in, for example, biotechnology, robotics, and energy, fundamentally reshaping existing industries and creating new ones. In this instance, to focus the mind, we can think of GenAI as no longer only a tool for scientists to analyze data\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a sense, it becomes the scientist, directing the research.\n21\nFor instance, let's say that GenAI applications in health care do not simply improve how we currently deliver care, but also enable therapies that target genetic mutations and cure diseases previously considered incurable.\n22\nSimilarly, manufacturing evolves to create GenAI-driven robotic factories, with goods produced with new materials and atomic precision.\n23\nMaterials science is transformed through the discovery of programmable materials and self-healing substances, all of which reshape construction, technology, and consumer goods.\n24\nMeanwhile, GenAI optimizes fusion energy research, expediting the shift to sustainable energy sources.\n25\nAnd GenAI helps to create the next generation of quantum computing.\n26\nIn that way, GenAI improves its own energy sources and computing capabilities, enabling it to become a more powerful creative tool.\n27\nFinance also looks radically different than it does today. Individuals with access to hyper-personalized financial planning and businesses with innovative products and services seamlessly connect with one another through near-frictionless or novel forms of financial intermediation.\n28\nTrading strategies and risk-management practices are boosted by greater GenAI-based analytic tools that have dynamic real-time access to an enormous knowledge base in both the public and private domains.\n29\nAlthough this transformative scenario is more speculative and is accompanied by a far greater degree of uncertainty than the first, it is important to consider given the extraordinary opportunities for human advancement and welfare that could arise, even if just one of its transformative components were to come to fruition. We would need to fundamentally reimagine how the economy is structured.\nWhat are the impacts on the labor force, in a world where GenAI's capabilities extend beyond what humans can accomplish today? Humans may have a role to manage multi-agent GenAI frameworks, or fill gaps where GenAI solutions remain expensive or inefficient for some applications. But this is a world where some workers may see their current jobs disappearing. It is also a world in which they may see their own work transformed and have many more choices about the work they do. The nature of labor would radically change, and this will require us to have broader conversations about how to organize the economy. These conversations should wrestle with how to navigate major economic shifts in a way that recognizes the impact on the human condition, and the extent to which people derive their communities, friendships, personal sense of meaning and dignity from their work.\nWhat about the competitive landscape? There is probably a greater likelihood that rewards for businesses would be distributed more unevenly at first, as significant breakthroughs with far-reaching ramifications may benefit a subset of firms and industries and concentrate economic power in firms that control GenAI breakthroughs. If only a handful of firms have the ability to accomplish the incredible things I've mentioned above, they may dominate markets and crowd out competitors. To the extent that GenAI becomes broadly effective, widely available, and cheap, these market advantages could lessen over time if the right regulatory environment supports competitive market dynamics.\n30\nBut history suggests caution in this regard; a handful of players may dominate.\n31\nAnd finally, for finance, we should anticipate fundamental changes in this scenario. When it's working well, the financial system helps move money and risk through time and space.\n32\nTo the extent there are fundamental changes to how the economy is organized, we could need a new set of institutions, markets, and products to facilitate transactions among households, businesses, and GenAI agents.\nWhat Should We Do?\nAmong the many ways in which we can help to harness the potential benefits of GenAI and minimize its risks, I will highlight only a couple today.\nFinancial institutions, and the Federal Reserve System, should consider investing sufficient resources in understanding GenAI technology, incorporating it into their workflows where appropriate, and training staff on how to use the technology responsibly and effectively.\n33\nMeanwhile, the financial regulatory community should approach the changing landscape with agility and flexibility. And beyond the financial sector, collaboration between governments, private industry, and research institutions will be critical to ensure that GenAI systems are not weaponized in catastrophic ways. We should continue to focus on responsible AI research and development and implement safeguards against misuse, including monitoring systems, standards for secure AI system development, and agreement on red lines for acceptable use cases.\n34\nWe should be attuned to the impact of GenAI on our economic and political institutions. There's a risk that it concentrates economic and political power in the hands of the very few and could lead to the gains being realized only by a small group, while the rest are left behind.\nAnother thing I want to emphasize is AI governance. I think most would agree that the goal of the technology is to improve the human condition, and to do that, we need to be intentional in advancing that goal. We should make sure that we think about GenAI as enhancing, not replacing, humans, and set up best practices and cultural norms to that end. Every financial institution should recognize the limitations of the technology, explore where and when GenAI belongs in any process, and identify how humans can be best positioned to be in the loop. We should also focus on data quality, and make sure that uses of GenAI do not perpetuate or amplify biases inherent in the data used to train the system or make incorrect inferences to the extent the data is incomplete or nonrepresentative.\n35\nIn the real",

Waller\nAt the University of New South Wales Macroeconomic Workshop, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia\nShare\nThank you, Bruce, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. It's great being back in Sydney and seeing old friends\u00e2\u0080\u0094like the Opera House!\nAs I look at the U.S. economy today, I see that the real side is doing just fine but progress on lowering inflation has come in fits and starts.\n1\nAfter two good months of inflation data for November and December, January once again disappointed and showed that progress on inflation remains uneven. I continue to believe that the current setting of monetary policy is restricting economic activity somewhat and putting downward pressure on inflation. If this winter-time lull in progress is temporary, as it was last year, then further policy easing will be appropriate. But until that is clear, I favor holding the policy rate steady.\nSpending by households and businesses has proved to be resilient, we have solid growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) and the latest data on employment, including revisions to most of 2024, support the view that labor market is in a sweet spot. Meanwhile, last week's January inflation data have a similar feel to that of January 2024, albeit to a smaller degree; they surprised on the high side and raised concerns that the progress we made in pushing inflation toward our 2 percent goal would stall out. But once we got past the first quarter of last year, we did see continued progress in reducing inflation in the latter part of the year. The question now is if we will see progress again later this year, as we did in 2024.\nProgress on inflation is an important consideration in policymakers' judgment about whether monetary policy needs adjustment in the near term. The continued solid labor market is one reason why I supported the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision at the end of January to hold our policy rate steady. After two good inflation reports for November and December there was concern about a January bounce back in inflation. So based on good labor market data and concerns about a seasonal shock to inflation not fully adjusted in the data, I felt it was prudent to stand pat at our January meeting. Given last week's inflation report, that concern was warranted.\nLet me pause here for a moment to address some commentary after the FOMC meeting that cited uncertainty about the new Administration's policies as a leading reason for that decision. We must keep in mind that there is always a degree of uncertainty about economic policy, and we need to act based on incoming data even when facing great uncertainty about the economic landscape. We have done this in the past and will continue to do so in the future.\nLet me provide two recent examples where the FOMC acted in the face of great uncertainty. In March 2022, inflation was roaring, and rate hikes were on the table. Then Russia invaded Ukraine, which created tremendous economic uncertainty around the globe. Not only did the FOMC raise the policy rate in March 2022 for the first time since 2019, but in subsequent meetings we also implemented large rate hikes for several meetings. We could not wait for uncertainty about the war to be resolved.\nThe second episode was in March of 2023 when stresses emerged in the U.S. banking system, stemming in part from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse, with the latter occurring the weekend before our March FOMC meeting. There was great uncertainty as to whether these events would lead to financial instability and a significant contraction of credit that could trigger a recession. Many forecasters projected a recession would hit in the second half of 2023 as a result. Consequently, there were calls to stop hiking the policy rate due to a tremendous amount of financial and banking uncertainty. But the Federal Reserve worked in concert with other government agencies and used its financial stabilization tools to deal with the banking issues and continued raising the policy rate to deal with inflation.\n2\nSo the moral of this story is that monetary policy cannot be put on hold waiting for these types of uncertainty to resolve.\nPutting uncertainty aside, let me turn to my view of the economic data. As I noted, real GDP continued to grow solidly in the fourth quarter, at a pace of 2.3 percent, and would have been nearly 1 percentage point stronger without a reduction in inventories, which tend to be volatile. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which are typically two-thirds of GDP, grew a robust 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter. As was noted in the Fed's latest\nMonetary Policy Report\nto Congress, households have a solid level of liquid assets to sustain their spending. Based on the limited data we have for the first quarter of 2025 this solid growth seems to be continuing. The employment report for January, which I will focus on in a moment, indicated a continued strong labor market, which should support consumption. Retail sales are reported to have fallen back in January after a strong rise in December, but given how volatile these data can be, and given that the cold weather in January probably held down sales, I'm not putting much weight on that reading for the time being. Business sentiment, as reflected in surveys of purchasing managers in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing, was among the most consistently positive in a while. The index for manufacturing businesses was 50.9, the first time since October 2022 that these results topped 50, as sentiment indicators about orders, production, and employment were all expanding. The corresponding index for the large majority of businesses outside manufacturing also indicated expansion, as it has for some time. The Blue Chip consensus of private forecasters and the Atlanta Fed's GDP Now forecast based on the data in hand predict growth this quarter similar to that of the end of last year. To circle back to my message earlier, many people predicted that tariffs proposed by the Administration on February 1 would have a significant effect on trade and consumption in the first quarter, not to mention prices, but after the postponement of some of those tariffs, it is unclear to me if and when that might show up in the data. I will, of course, be watching closely, but I haven't altered my outlook based on what has been implemented to date.\nAs I noted earlier, data on the labor market indicate that it is in a good spot, with employers having an easier time filling jobs than earlier in the expansion but with still ample demand for new workers and new jobs being created. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4 percent, which is just about where it has been for the past year. Employers added a net 143,000 jobs in January, down some from a 204,000 average for the final three months of 2024 but right around the 133,000 average for the quarter before that. Two factors that may have held down this number a bit were cold weather and the fires in Los Angeles, which prevented thousands of people from getting to or performing their jobs. Beyond payrolls, the ratio of job vacancies to the number of unemployed people stands at 1.1, close to the level before the pandemic.\nWage growth continues to be strong, and it has considerably outpaced price increases, but is down from two years ago, and for a few reasons, I don't judge recent data as indicating that wages are a factor preventing inflation from making continued progress toward 2 percent. Though the January reading of average hourly earnings was a bit elevated, this series is pretty volatile and the reading may have been held up by weather-related issues. Smoothing through the monthly fluctuations, we see wage growth fairly steady at 4 percent a month over the past year. Broader measures of worker compensation show a more distinct moderation in growth. The Labor Department's employment cost index has fallen gradually but consistently from 4.2 percent at the end of 2023 to 3.8 percent at its last reading.\nAs for whether 4 percent wage growth is consistent with 2 percent inflation, I will note, as I have before, that productivity has grown at roughly a 2 percent annual rate since the advent of the pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u0094and slightly faster than that in 2023 and 2024. Unless that productivity trend changes a lot, wage growth is consistent with bringing inflation down to 2 percent.\nTurning to inflation, last week's data taken as a whole were mildly disappointing but not nearly so disappointing as a focus on the consumer price index (CPI) alone would have indicated. Total CPI inflation for January came in hot at 0.5 percent, and core was 0.4 percent, which brings the 12-month changes to 3.0 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively. These 12-month readings are lower than we had in January 2024, so we have made some progress over the past year, but they are still too high.\nHowever, we also received producer price data last week, and, combining that information with the CPI data, forecasts for January PCE inflation aren't as alarming as the CPI inflation data. Estimates for total PCE inflation, the FOMC's preferred measure, are about 0.3 percent and that for core PCE inflation was around 0.25 percent. These numbers will mean a bump-up in the monthly pace of core inflation of about one-tenth of 1 percentage point from readings of under 0.2 percent in November and December. And this would leave the 12-month and 6-month average core PCE inflation around 2.6 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively. These rates are lower than where they stood in January 2024, which is good, but progress has been slower than I expected on reducing inflation to our 2 percent target.\nAs a policymaker, I rely on these data to help me judge how close we are to meeting our inflation target. And I'm thinking hard about how to interpret these recent numbers because there seems to be some pattern over the past few years of higher inflation readings at the start of the year. This pattern brings into question whether the inflation data have \"residual seasonality,\" which means that statisticians have not fully corrected for some apparent seasonal fluctuations in some prices. Many firms reset their prices at the beginning of each year, and the Commerce Department tries to factor this in, but even after this adjustment, there is a consensus among economists that some seasonality remains. Incidentally, this probably isn't just a problem in January. Some recently updated research by the Fed staff shows that inflation in the first months of the year has been higher than in the second half for 16 of the last 22 years.\n3\nI'm alert to this issue and will watch the data over the next few months to evaluate if we are having what looks like a repeat of high first quarter inflation data that could be followed by lower readings later in the year.\nBefore I get to my outlook for monetary policy, I want to address a topic of some debate recently, which is the divergence between long-term interest rates and the FOMC's policy rate since we started cutting rates in September. While the FOMC has reduced the policy rate 100 basis points since then, yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury security have increased by a noticeable amount. In theory, longer-term rates should follow the expected path of the overnight policy rate set by the FOMC. But this relationship is based on the classic economic assumption of ceteris paribus, or \"all other factors remaining constant.\" The 10-year Treasury security trades in a deep, liquid global market, and its yield is affected by a variety of factors other than the path of the policy rate. This means that all other factors are not constant and that the 10-year Treasury yield may not follow the federal funds rate.\nPerhaps the most famous example of the divergence of market interest rates and policy rates began in the mid 2000's. The FOMC was tightening monetary policy from 2004 to 2006 and raised the policy rate 425 basis points. Over that time, Treasury yields barely moved. This was so surprising that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan referred to it as a \"conundrum.\" At about the same time, future Chair Ben Bernanke identified what he called a \"global savings glut\" that was pushing up foreign demand for Treasury securities and putting downward pressure on yields. Over time, this has come to be seen as a significant factor for the conundrum then and as a factor for low Treasury yields subsequently. This example is just to illustrate that the 10-year Treasury yield may not respond to the policy rate as expected because of a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the FOMC.\nSo, what does my economic outlook mean for monetary policy? The labor market is balanced and remarkably resilient. If you want an example of a stable labor market with employment at its maximum level, it looks a lot like where we are right now. On the other side of the FOMC's mandate, inflation is still meaningfully above our target, and progress has been excruciatingly slow over the last year. This tells me that we should currently have a restrictive setting of policy, as we do\u00e2\u0080\u0094to continue to move inflation down to our goal\u00e2\u0080\u0094but that setting should be getting closer to neutral as inflation moves closer to 2 percent and should allow the labor market to remain in a good place.\nSo for now, I believe a pause in rate cuts is appropriate. Assuming the labor market continues to be in rough balance, I can wait and see if the higher inflation readings in January moderate, as they have in the past couple of years. If so, I'll have to decide if this reflects residual seasonality that will go away later in the year and if the underlying trend in inflation is toward 2 percent, or if there is a different issue holding up inflation and how that may play out. Whichever case it may be, the data are not supporting a reduction in the policy rate at this time. But if 2025 plays out like 2024, rate cuts would be appropriate at some point this year.\nAnd while we are waiting on data to understand how the economy is moving relative to our objectives, we will learn more about Administration policies. My baseline view is that any imposition of tariffs will only modestly increase prices and in a non-persistent manner. So I favor looking through these effects when setting monetary policy to the best of our ability. Of course, I concede that the effects of tariffs could be larger than I anticipate, depending on how large they are and how they are implemented. But we also need to remember that it is possible that other policies under discussion could have positive supply effects and put downward pressure on inflation. At the end of the day, the data shou",

Today I would like to share a brief update on my views on monetary policy and the economy, before I turn to bank regulatory issues, and describe how I think that regulators should approach the important work of \"maintenance\" of the regulatory framework.\nEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nToward the end of last year, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began the process of moving the target range for the federal funds rate to a more neutral setting to reflect the progress made since 2023 on lowering inflation and cooling the labor market. At our September meeting, the FOMC voted to lower the target range, for the first time since we began tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, by 50 basis points to 4-3/4 to 5 percent.\nYou may remember that I dissented from that decision, the first time a Fed Governor dissented from an FOMC rate decision in nearly 20 years. I preferred a smaller initial cut to begin the policy recalibration phase. I explained my reasoning in a statement published after the meeting noting that the strong economy and a healthy labor market did not warrant a larger cut. In addition, moving the policy rate down too quickly could unnecessarily risk stoking demand, potentially reigniting inflationary pressures, and could be interpreted as a premature \"declaration of victory\" on our price-stability mandate.\nAt the most recent FOMC meeting last month, my colleagues and I voted to hold the federal funds rate target range at 4-1/4 to 4\u00e2\u0080\u00911/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. I supported this action because, after recalibrating the policy rate by 100 basis points through the December meeting, I think that policy is now in a good place, allowing the Committee to be patient and pay closer attention to the inflation data as it evolves.\nIn my view, the current policy stance also provides the opportunity to review further indicators of economic activity and get further clarity on the administration's policies and their effects on the economy. It will be very important to have a better sense of these policies, how they will be implemented, and establish greater confidence about how the economy will respond in the coming weeks and months.\nFor now, the U.S. economy remains strong, with solid growth in economic activity and a labor market near full employment. Core inflation is still somewhat elevated, but has appeared to resume its downward path, and my baseline expectation has been that it will moderate further this year. Even with this outlook, there are upside risks to my baseline expectation for the inflation path.\nIn 2023, the rate of inflation declined significantly, but it has taken longer to see further meaningful declines since that time. The latest consumer and producer price index reports suggest that the 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094which excludes food and energy prices\u00e2\u0080\u0094likely moved down to around 2.6 percent in January, which would represent a noticeable stepdown from its 2.8 percent reading in December and 3.0 percent at the end of 2023. Progress had been especially slow and uneven since the spring of last year mostly due to rising core goods price inflation.\nAfter increasing at a solid pace, on average, over the first nine months of last year, gross domestic product appears to have risen a bit more moderately in the fourth quarter, reflecting a large drop in the volatile category of inventory investment. In contrast, private domestic final purchases, which provide a better signal about underlying growth in economic activity, maintained its strong momentum from earlier in the year, as personal consumption rose robustly again in the fourth quarter. Following strong readings in December, retail sales and sales of motor vehicles softened in January. However, these data can be noisy around this time of the year and sales were likely affected by the cold and wintery weather last month.\nPayroll employment gains have picked up since the summer of last year and averaged a strong pace of about 240,000 per month over the past three months, with last month's gains likely held back by the Los Angeles wildfires and the harsh winter weather. The unemployment rate edged down further to 4.0 percent in January and has moved sideways since the middle of last year, remaining below my estimate of full employment.\nThe labor market appears to have stabilized in the second half of last year, after it loosened from extremely tight conditions. The rise in the unemployment rate since mid-2023 largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs have remained low. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has remained close to the pre-pandemic level in recent months, and there are still more available jobs than available workers. The labor market no longer appears to be especially tight, but wage growth remains somewhat above the pace consistent with our inflation goal.\nThe recent revision of the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor data further vindicates my view that the labor market was not weakening in a concerning way during the summer of last year. Although payroll employment gains were revised down considerably in the 12 months through March 2024, job gains were little revised, on net, over the remainder of last year. It is crucial that U.S. official data more accurately capture structural changes in labor markets in real time, so we can confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic policymaking. But in the meantime, given conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and significant data revisions in recent years, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.\nAssuming the economy evolves as I expect, I think that inflation will slow further this year. As the inflation data since the spring of last year show, its progress may be bumpy and uneven, and progress on disinflation may take longer than we would hope. I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market remains strong.\nWith encouraging signs that geopolitical tensions may be abating in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and in Asia, I will be monitoring global supply chains which could continue to be susceptible to disruptions, and lead to inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. In addition, the release of pent-up demand following the election could lead to stronger economic activity, which could also influence inflationary pressures.\nHaving entered a new phase in the process of moving the federal funds rate toward a more neutral policy stance, there are a few considerations that lead me to prefer a cautious and gradual approach to adjusting policy, as it provides us time to assess progress in achieving our inflation and employment goals.\nGiven the current policy stance, I think that easier financial conditions from higher equity prices over the past year may have slowed progress on disinflation. And I am watching the increase in longer-term Treasury yields that has occurred since the start of policy recalibration at the September meeting. Some have interpreted it as a reflection of investors' concerns about inflation risks and the possibility of tighter-than-expected policy that may be required to address inflationary pressures.\nThere is still more work to be done to bring inflation closer to our 2 percent goal. I would like to gain greater confidence that progress in lowering inflation will continue as we consider making further adjustments to the target range. We need to keep inflation in focus while the labor market appears to be in balance and the unemployment rate remains at historically low levels. Before our March meeting, we will have received one additional month of inflation and employment data.\nLooking forward, it is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts to help me interpret the signals provided by real-time data and as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance.\nBringing inflation in line with our price stability goal is essential for sustaining a healthy labor market and fostering an economy that works for everyone in the longer run.\nMaintenance of the Regulatory Framework\nI will now turn to bank supervision, the bank applications process, and regulation. Community banks experience the burden of the regulatory framework most acutely when it is not appropriately tailored to their size, risk, complexity, and business model. While promoting safety and soundness in the banking system\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly among community banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094is an important and necessary regulatory objective, we must also be cautious to ensure that the framework does not become an impediment to their operations, preventing them from providing competitive products and services, innovating, and engaging in appropriate risk-taking.\nDuring my tenure at the Board, I have laid out a wide range of issues and concerns that I see as critical components that are necessary to build and maintain an effective regulatory framework.\n2\nWhile I will only address a subset of these issues today, I'd like to begin by clarifying what I mean by this.\nOur work to maintain an effective framework is never really complete. Just as complacency can be fatal to the business of a bank, complacency can also prevent regulators from meeting their statutory obligation to promote a safe and sound banking system that enables banks to serve their customers effectively and efficiently.\nSystem maintenance is not something that we should shy away from. In our everyday lives, we invest significant time in maintenance. We schedule regular oil changes for our cars, and we invest in the infrastructure that allows our economy to function. Devoting resources to maintenance often prevents more costly issues down the road\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's easier to get oil changes than it is to rebuild an engine.\nSo, what does maintenance look like in practice? To address this question, I think it's helpful to look at three core areas in the bank regulatory framework: Supervision, Bank applications, and Regulation.\nApproach to Supervision\nLet's start with supervision. Supervision operates almost entirely outside of the public view. Much of the work involves the review of proprietary business information from banks, and the preparation of examination reports shielded from public scrutiny under the auspices of protecting confidential supervisory information. But confidentiality should not be used to prevent scrutiny and accountability in the assignment of ratings.\nSo, today, I am going to dig a bit deeper into the realm of supervision to discuss supervisory ratings, accountability, and the troubling trend of inaction and opacity within the supervisory toolkit.\nRational Standards & Ratings\nWhile there is some public disclosure of supervisory information, it is often difficult to get a true understanding of supervision based on data that may be released. In fact, this data often sends confusing and conflicting signals. For example, the Board's Supervision and Regulation Report presented information stating that only one-third of large financial institutions maintained satisfactory ratings across all relevant ratings components in the first half of 2024.\n3\nAt the same time, this report noted that most large financial institutions met supervisory expectations with respect to capital and liquidity.\n4\nThe odd mismatch between financial condition and overall supervisory condition as assessed by the prudential regulators raises a more significant issue, whether subjective examiner judgment\u00e2\u0080\u0094those evaluations based on subjective, examiner-driven, non-financial concerns\u00e2\u0080\u0094is driving the firm's overall rating. Are ratings trends based on the materiality of the identified issues, or do they imply that the regulators see widespread fragility in the banking system?\nWhile this example highlights a large bank ratings framework issue, it is symptomatic of a broader issue that warrants scrutiny\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether the approach to supervision has led to a world in which core financial risks have been de-prioritized, and non-core and non-financial risks\u00e2\u0080\u0094things like IT, operational risk, management, risk management, internal controls, and governance\u00e2\u0080\u0094have been over-emphasized. These issues are important, and certainly worthwhile topics for examiners to consider, but their review should not come at the expense of more material financial risk considerations\u00e2\u0080\u0094and they should not drive the overall assessment of a firm's condition. There is evidence that supervision has undergone such a shift, not only among large banks, but among regional and community banks as well.\n5\nFor all institutions, financial metrics are not among the primary findings determined from the examination process, and arguably they have been de-emphasized when assigning supervisory ratings.\nPrioritization is valuable in the supervisory process, both to inform how examiners allocate their time, but also in helping banks allocate resources to remediate issues identified during the supervisory process. The frequency of supervisory findings related to non-financial metrics may be a byproduct of how long it takes to remediate these issues, like longstanding issues with IT systems that have not been enhanced over many years of growth. However, we should also be vigilant and deliberate about any shift in supervisory focus from financial risk toward non-financial risks and internal processes, as this shift is not focused on fundamental safety and soundness issues and it is not cost-free.\nWe should also not expect every firm to coalesce around a single set of products, internal processes, and risk-management practices. Variety in banking models is a strength and a necessity of the U.S. banking system, relying on management and boards of directors to determine bank strategy, rather than a bank's bu",

Waller\nAt A Very Stable Conference, San Francisco, California\nShare\nThank you for inviting me to speak today about stablecoins, an important innovation for the crypto ecosystem with the potential to improve retail and cross-border payments.\n1\nA little over three years ago, I outlined my views on the benefits and risks of stablecoins.\n2\nI can think of no better place than this conference to discuss the maturing stablecoin market and examine potential challenges that could impede stablecoins from reaching their full potential.\nFor the purposes of this speech, I define stablecoins as a type of digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a national currency and backed at least one-to-one with safe and liquid assets. Specifically, a pool of assets is held in reserve so that stablecoins can be redeemed for traditional currency in a timely fashion.\nStablecoins\u00e2\u0080\u0094as with any means of payment\u00e2\u0080\u0094must demonstrate 1) a clear\nuse case\nand 2) a clear\ncommercial case\nto be economically viable. These terms are often conflated, but they are different, and both are necessary. Having a use case is how you attract consumers and businesses, while a business model is necessary for issuers of stablecoins to continue operating. As private sector innovators look to expand on the use cases of stablecoins and seek to achieve scale, what might emerge as challenges or roadblocks? This is a question I will explore today, including from a public sector perspective. Of course, as a policymaker, I am not here to endorse any of these use cases or business models, and what follows is not advice or recommendations. Rather, I am discussing them to underscore the varied ecosystem that policymakers must understand.\nI will begin by explaining some of the use cases of stablecoins, including those that are well established and those that are still emerging. The primary use of stablecoins is as a safe crypto store of value. In the early days of crypto trading, buying and selling crypto meant trading one crypto-asset for another crypto-asset. As we have seen, crypto prices can fluctuate substantially, which means crypto-assets that are not anchored as stablecoins suffer from price risk. All financial markets crave the existence of a safe, low-risk asset which allows traders to move out of risky positions into safe ones where the safe asset price is known and stable. The beauty of financial innovation is that if a market demands such an asset, someone will figure out how to supply it. Thus, stablecoins were born.\nA stablecoin's value is tied to a national fiat currency, with the U.S. dollar being the fiat currency of choice for most stablecoins. In this sense, stablecoins are synthetic dollars. In our everyday life, the dollar serves as a medium of exchange and a unit of account. By their tie to the dollar, stablecoins are the medium of exchange and unit of account in the crypto ecosystem.\nBut how does one trade a \"real\" dollar for a \"synthetic\" dollar, like a stablecoin? Exchanges already allowed agents to move in and out of the crypto ecosystem but doing so took time and money. Stablecoins provided a marketplace solution to this problem\u00e2\u0080\u0094a means to represent dollars on exchanges so that transactions could be carried out more quickly and efficiently. Currently, stablecoins are involved in over 80 percent of trading volume on major centralized crypto exchanges.\n3\nA second stablecoin use case is providing a means to access and hold U.S. dollars. Today, around 99 percent of stablecoin market capitalization is denominated in U.S. dollars, and the vast majority of digital asset trades are priced in U.S. dollars.\n4\nThis is no surprise given the primacy of the U.S. dollar in global finance and trade, and I believe that stablecoins have the potential to maintain and extend the role of the dollar internationally.\n5\nU.S. dollar stablecoins could be particularly appealing to those in high inflation countries or to those without easy or affordable access to dollar cash or banking services.\nA third use case is cross-border payments. For example, we are hearing increased industry focus on the \"stablecoin sandwich\" model of cross-border payments, in which fiat currency in one country is converted first into a U.S. dollar stablecoin, then that stablecoin is transferred to another individual, and then finally the stablecoin is converted back into the local fiat currency at its destination. This has the potential to reduce the complexity of a series of correspondent banking networks, improving transparency, cost, and timeliness. As this use case develops, it is critical that market participants implement all anti-money laundering and relevant consumer safeguards.\nThe last use case I will describe is in retail payments. At present, stablecoin use for retail payments is very limited. However, I am seeing a lot of new, private sector entrants looking to find ways to support the use of stablecoins for retail payments. For example, firms that provide point-of-sale technology are acquiring innovative fintechs or developing their own capabilities to accept stablecoins for retail purchases. This provides consumers with yet another option. Firms are also looking to incorporate stablecoins\u00e2\u0080\u0094and crypto more broadly\u00e2\u0080\u0094into peer-to-peer payment apps.\nIt remains to be seen whether stablecoins will scale for retail payment use cases. Such an evolution would require both a substantial number of consumers to shift their preferences toward using stablecoins and a significant number of businesses to make necessary investments to receive payments via stablecoins. We know that consumer retail payments behavior is sticky, and when behavior does change, it generally happens over a long period. If retail payments use cases do increase, it would probably take years to have a significant impact. That said, if stablecoins reduce transaction fees or allow merchants to attract customers, then merchants could have an incentive to accept them. Ultimately, the market will sort out whether consumers and businesses have the incentives to use stablecoins in this way.\nIn addition to stablecoins having clear cut use cases, issuers must have a viable business model. To cite one famous example, Red Lobster's endless shrimp deal was popular with customers, but it did not turn out to be a sustainable model for the restaurant chain. Let me describe what I think are the incentives for stablecoin issuers, but I am here today to learn more.\nTo date, most stablecoin issuers appear to generate revenue primarily by earning higher returns on their reserve assets than they incur in expenses. They issue a zero-interest liability and use the proceeds to acquire interest earning assets, thereby profiting from the spread. As with bank deposits, the interest rate environment will have a significant effect on the profitability of firms issuing stablecoins. Higher interest rates generally mean higher rates of return on reserve assets, which generates revenue for the issuer. However, higher interest rates also have the potential to make non-interest bearing assets less attractive for consumers to hold. That said, users who hold stablecoins as an accessible, safe store of U.S. dollar denominated value may not be particularly sensitive to the interest rate environment, a phenomenon we already see today with some holders of physical U.S. dollars.\nAn additional way stablecoin issuers can generate revenue is through fees. This could include charging minting and burning fees, which occur when a customer acquires a new stablecoin for a real dollar or wants to redeem it for real dollars. This is very much like the foreign exchange market in fiat currencies that most of us are familiar with. Alternatively, as occurs with most payments firms, the issuer could earn money from transaction fees.\nFinally, stablecoin issuers may use stablecoins as part of a broader strategy to attract customers to whom they may sell other products and services. In that case, stablecoins could be seen as a \"loss leader\" to entice customers to use other products or services offered by the stablecoin issuer that are much more profitable.\nWith the exception of the last example, the viability of the other business models will depend on the ability of stablecoins to scale as a means of payment and on how consumers and businesses respond. For example, if the stablecoin issuer decides to pass through interest earnings on its assets, that will make the stablecoin more attractive, but it will reduce the profits from issuing a stablecoin. The smaller the interest rate spread, the more important scale becomes. For the fee-based models, free entry into this space will drive down fees as it does in any other market, which will reduce the revenue from issuing a stablecoin.\nWithin this market, scale is important for achieving certain use cases as well as satisfying certain business models. For example, stablecoins are unlikely to become a viable option for retail payments if consumers question whether stablecoins will be widely accepted as a means of payment, while stablecoin issuers cannot generate significant revenue from interest on backing assets or fees without scale. I call this the \"Field of Dreams\" problem\u00e2\u0080\u0094if you build it, will they come?\nWith all of that in mind, let's now dive into some of the potential challenges or roadblocks that will need to be overcome for stablecoins to achieve their full potential.\nThe first theme I will explore is one that I have discussed in the past\u00e2\u0080\u0094the safety and soundness of stablecoins and the need for a clear regulatory regime for stablecoins in the United States.\n6\nStablecoins are forms of private money and, like any form of private money, are subject to run risk, and we have seen \"depegs\" of some stablecoins in recent years. Additionally, all payment systems face risk of failure, and stablecoins are subject to clearing, settlement, and other payment system risks as well. At the same time, it is important to note that the risks faced by stablecoin issuers are not the same risks faced by banks. The stablecoin market would benefit from a U.S. regulatory and supervisory framework that addresses stablecoin risks directly, fully, and narrowly. This framework should allow both non-banks and banks to issue regulated stablecoins and should consider the effects of regulation on the payments landscape, including competing payment instruments.\nI want to reiterate that I think it is important that U.S. legislation makes provision for the supervision and regulation of stablecoin issuers that is proportionate to the risks they pose, without stifling their innovative potential while the marketplace is still developing. I believe in the power of the private sector to develop solutions that benefit businesses and consumers, with the job of the public sector to create a fair set of rules for market participants to operate within, including guardrails that ensure safety for consumers and the financial system as a whole. Having a level of certainty is important for businesses looking to invest in new products and services as well as for consumer confidence and assurance.\nFragmentation is the next theme I'll explore, first from a technical perspective. Currently, several popular blockchain networks are designed as distinct from one another. Firms looking to scale across blockchains are seeking technical solutions to achieve cross-chain interoperability. Will this ultimately prove efficient, especially in a world with multiple stablecoin providers operating within potentially different combinations of blockchain networks? Or will there be multiple, competing ecosystems, for example where one stablecoin dominates on certain blockchains, and another stablecoin dominates on others? Alternatively, a stablecoin market featuring a high degree of interoperability could support a variety of stablecoin issuers and blockchain networks, providing consumers a choice in stablecoins and technologies. It is not yet clear how these dynamics will ultimately impact business models and use cases for stablecoins, but it is an issue that bears watching as firms work to scale and mature their businesses.\nFragmentation around the use and acceptance of stablecoins will also act as an impediment to scaling and will impact how stablecoin use cases develop. As I noted, stablecoins will prove useful as a means of payment insofar as holders of a specific stablecoin expect that others will accept them. The more people will accept a stablecoin, the more convenient a stablecoin will be. For the retail payment use case, how easy will it be for me as a consumer to pay with stablecoins at the point of sale, either in-person or online? From the merchant perspective, what incentives will firms have to accept stablecoins? Similarly, for cross-border payments, how widely will different firms (and their banking partners) transact in stablecoins? And, more broadly, could stablecoins have the potential to recreate and potentially exacerbate the current challenges associated with correspondent banking, further fragmenting the marketplace? Or could stablecoins mature in such a way to change the market structure of cross-border payments?\nFragmentation in regulation also has the potential to hold stablecoins back from reaching their full potential. As I already discussed, the stablecoin market does not have a clear regulatory framework in the United States. While there have been efforts to develop some international standards, the emergence of different global stablecoin regulatory regimes creates the potential for conflicting regulation domestically and internationally.\n7\nThis regulatory fragmentation could make it difficult for U.S. dollar stablecoin issuers to operate at a global scale. And as I have noted, scale is vital for any means of payment to achieve its full potential.\nFor example, under Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, stablecoin issuers can earn interest on their reserve assets as a business model, whereas other regulatory models being discussed would require reserves for stablecoins deemed systemically important to be held as non-interest-bearing central bank deposits, limiting stablecoin issuers into a specific business model. Domestically, state regulators have been key players in the development of the stablecoin market, and several states are in the process of developing state laws or finalizing new regulations related to stablecoin issuance. There is a risk that state regulations may conflict, which could prevent the use of the same stablecoin across all states and reduce stablecoin scalability. As with the United States' dual banking system, a complementary framework with state and federal regulators worki",

Kugler\nAt 2025 Miami Economic Forum, Economic Club of Miami, Miami, Florida\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Jon, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nIt is such a pleasure to be back in Miami, a city I have seen grow and become ever more dynamic over the decades, as I have come many times to visit my large extended family here ever since the 1980s.\nAs I discussed in my final speech of 2024, two positive supply shocks have significantly benefited the U.S. economy over the past two years and have also affected the conduct of monetary policy.\n2\nThe first of these has been the surge in population over the past few years that has helped bring labor supply into balance with labor demand and, thus, also helped move inflation toward the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent goal. The other positive supply shock, which I outlined in my remarks in December, has been a step-up in aggregate productivity growth since 2020, which is an increase in the amount of economic output, across the economy, per hour worked or some other unit of labor. Although productivity growth, measured quarterly, can be quite volatile, over the past five years this acceleration is quite evident. While productivity grew by about 1.5 percent a year from 2005 to 2019, starting in 2020 it has grown about 2 percent a year. This difference may not look dramatic, but because of compounding year-over-year, the consequences of an additional 1/2 percentage point in growth over the past five years are significant for workers and the U.S. economy. When workers are more productive, it effectively means that businesses can produce more without needing to add workers, and that they can pay workers more without needing to raise prices. When they are more productive, it can also serve as an incentive for businesses to expand. Across the economy, higher productivity growth means that real wages and living standards for workers can rise faster without putting upward pressure on inflation.\nAnd that is exactly what has been happening recently, a period when inflation has been falling while the economy is expanding. While fast growth in wages was one of the factors driving inflation in 2021 and 2022, most likely some of that increase was due to productivity growth and, hence, was not inflationary. If productivity continues to grow at an accelerated pace, it would support the FOMC's efforts to keep unemployment low and return inflation to a sustained level of 2 percent. For that reason, I would like to spend the balance of my remarks exploring some of the possible reasons why productivity has accelerated, and the prospects that this fortunate development will continue.\nNumerous factors affect aggregate productivity, and several may have driven the increase in productivity growth in the U.S. since the pandemic, in contrast to the subdued productivity growth experienced by other advanced economies around the world.\nOne such factor may have been a result of the enormous movement of workers caused by the pandemic. It began with the dramatic loss of 22 million jobs in the spring of 2020, the reemployment of many of those workers and the continued mobility as people quit jobs, switched occupations and careers, and relocated in response to the enormous changes in work and home life brought about by the pandemic. In finding new jobs, in what became a very tight labor market, workers had the opportunity to find better matches for their skills and, to some extent, work that they were motivated to carry out and which made them more productive. One indication that this was probably a significant factor in the U.S. is that other advanced economies where there was less worker movement have experienced lower rates of productivity growth.\n3\nEconomic data and research suggest that periods of strong job re-allocation are accompanied or followed by higher productivity growth.\n4\nThe tightness of the labor market since 2021 has also likely led firms to invest to a greater extent in labor-saving as well as labor-enhancing technologies, which, of course, is traditionally one of the major sources of productivity gains. For example, many retail businesses seemed to have installed more self-checkout machines after the onset of the pandemic, allowing employers to substitute capital for workers when workers could not come to work in person and when there were severe shortages. More generally, digital technology allowed employees to continue working from home during the period of the pandemic and beyond, saving commuting time and making employees potentially more productive.\n5\nTo the extent that these factors are boosting productivity growth, they are by their nature one-off developments that eventually will fade. A notable exception may turn out to be productivity improvements from investments in artificial intelligence (AI). AI investment by businesses has stepped up in the past two years, and it appears to be accelerating.\n6\nThe advent of the internet and related innovations boosted productivity growth for about 10 years starting in the mid-1990s, and the benefits of AI could potentially be that revolutionary and persistent.\nIn addition to being temporary, the factors that I have outlined that could be boosting productivity, job re-allocation, and technological investments are themselves hard to measure across the economy. And so are their effects on productivity as well. But there is another important factor that is likely to be driving productivity higher whose effects may well persist, and that is the surge in new business formation experienced since 2019. As I will explain, new businesses are associated with higher rates of overall productivity growth, and that may be particularly true for some of the sectors in which these businesses were created.\nApplications for new business tax identification numbers jumped shortly after the pandemic began and have remained elevated since then.\n7\nIn 2024, the pace of applications that are likely to result in employer business formation was about 30 percent above its 2019 pace. This surge is largely unique to the U.S. In the euro zone, for example, business registrations have been relatively flat. This may help explain why labor productivity growth in Europe has been well below that of the U.S. in recent years.\n8\nThe surge in applications in early 2020 was an early signal of an acceleration in the creation of job-creating new firms.\n9\nThe latest data available indicate that new firms created 1.9 million jobs in 2023, 14 percent higher than the total for 2019.\n10\nA couple of aspects of this surge in business entry in the U.S. are noteworthy. First, the surge was particularly noticeable in high-tech industries that, historically, are important for overall innovation and productivity growth.\n11\nSecond, while the pace of business applications has cooled somewhat over the past year, it still remains elevated and well above pre-pandemic norms. It is, in fact, proving somewhat more persistent than some expected.\nFor these reasons, the surge in new business formation is highly relevant to our discussion about productivity. There is a large body of research that finds that new firms are key contributors to innovation and growth in aggregate productivity.\n12\nThis might seem surprising and counterintuitive, since it is well known that many new firms fail in their first year or two. But in the commotion of competition that these many new businesses face, there are always businesses that persist and keep their lights on, and those often do so because they are innovative and more productive. New businesses are the essence of the competition that drives market-based economies, and it is not surprising that they would be an important source of new products or processes for doing business\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a source of growth.\n13\nOf course, not every new firm has to innovate and grow to make important economic contributions. Every entrepreneur contributes even if they just create a job for themselves and their family members. But those new firms that do innovate and grow are critical for improvements in overall productivity over time.\nAs I noted before, since the surge in entrepreneurship after the onset of the pandemic featured an increase in high-tech businesses as well, the productivity implications could be significant. Indeed, the last period of strong productivity growth in the U.S., which ran from the late 1990s into the early 2000s, was preceded by a surge of new business creation in high-tech industries, including those industries that more recently have been associated with AI-related developments.\n14\nSo this is one source of my optimism about continued robust productivity growth in the U.S.\nBut it is not only the innovations produced directly by new businesses that are important, since by any measure these new firms are a small share of total businesses. New businesses also help drive innovation by existing firms. As they scramble for funding, customers, and human capital, new businesses will increase competition with existing ones, forcing them to innovate as well so they can succeed. This is surely also driving the recent acceleration in productivity growth.\nMany predicted that the surge in new business creation would disappear as effects of the pandemic have faded, but this has not really happened. It is possible that the surge in entry will recede and that its productivity effects will likewise be temporary. On the other hand, the productivity gains from a surge in entry could last for some time, since these highly productive young firms have been found to grow rapidly for several years, contributing to aggregate productivity growth along the way. Time will tell, but for now, it seems likely that this is a factor supporting productivity growth at a higher-than-historical rate.\nI will confess to you all that it is not a coincidence that I have come to Miami to highlight the role of entrepreneurship in innovation and productivity growth. Miami and the Miami metropolitan area is an extraordinarily entrepreneurial area, a place with high rates of new business creation, and it is likely an important source of the recent productivity surge.\nOut of more than 900 U.S. cities for which we have data, Miami's post-pandemic new firm entry rate ranked 8th in the nation.\n15\nAnd Miami is not alone in Florida; 5 of the top 20 cities for pandemic-era business formation are here in your state.\n16\nMiami specifically, and Florida generally, has been a key part of the U.S. entrepreneurship story for some time. During the decade before the pandemic, Miami ranked 5th out of more than 900 U.S. cities for firm entry rates, and Florida featured 8 of the top 20 U.S. cities.\n17\nMiami is special in this regard. I wonder what is in the water here to produce such a dynamic, entrepreneurial culture. Perhaps it is the extent of sunshine, which has long been associated with optimism. Perhaps it is the friendly economic climate\u00e2\u0080\u0094in my own academic research, I have found that policies that facilitate business entry and support worker or job re-allocation are indeed helpful for dynamism and productivity.\n18\nBut an interesting question for me as the first Hispanic at the Board of Governors since its creation is whether the large Hispanic population in Florida is also a factor behind the impressive pace of business dynamism that I have just described.\nMore than 25 percent of Florida's population is Hispanic, compared with around 20 percent for the United States as a whole.\n19\nNationwide, recent data indicate that Latinos account for a dominant\u00e2\u0080\u0094and rapidly growing\u00e2\u0080\u0094share of new entrepreneurship in the U.S., with a particular increase since the pandemic.\n20\nOf course, many of these Latino entrepreneurs are also immigrants, another group with a well-known proclivity for entrepreneurship.\n21\nThere are immigrants in Miami from the Caribbean and all over the world who contribute to the entrepreneurial culture of this city, and it is surely this culture, as much as the efforts of any nationality or group, that is the real engine of the dynamism here. I applaud you all for fostering that culture here in Florida, which is such an important contributor to the economic growth of our nation. More entrepreneurs means more productivity, which is crucial to U.S. prosperity.\nLet me conclude with an outline of my views on the outlook for the U.S. economy and the FOMC's efforts to return inflation to our 2 percent goal while maintaining a strong labor market.\nThe U.S. economy remains on a firm footing.\nReal gross domestic product (GDP) continues to grow at a solid pace. The Bureau for Economic Analysis estimates that real GDP grew 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024, and private domestic final purchases, which is the best indicator for GDP one quarter ahead, grew a solid 3.2 percent. Therefore, I anticipate solid GDP growth also in the first quarter of this year. In addition, earlier today the Labor Department reported that U.S. employers created 143,000 jobs in January and the unemployment rate edged down to 4 percent, consistent with a healthy labor market that is neither weakening nor showing signs of overheating.\nInflation has fallen significantly since its peak in the middle of 2022, and in September the FOMC judged that it was time to begin reducing our policy interest rate from levels intended to strongly restrict aggregate demand and put downward pressure on inflation. We reduced our policy rate 100 basis points through December, but the recent progress on inflation has been slow and uneven, and inflation remains elevated. There is also considerable uncertainty about the economic effects of proposals of new policies. Going forward, in considering the appropriate federal funds rate, we will watch these developments closely and continue to carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\nThank you again for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1.

Bowman\nAt the Kansas Bankers Association Government Relations Conference, Topeka, Kansas\nShare\nGovernor Bowman presented identical remarks at the 2025 Wisconsin Bankers Association Bank Executives Conference, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on February 7, 2025, and at the 2025 Iowa Bankers Association Bank Management and Policy Conference, Des Moines, Iowa (virtual), on February 11, 2025.\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you today.\n1\nIt is a pleasure to be with you. I always enjoy the opportunity to meet bankers from across the country to learn about the issues that are important to you. Recently, I have observed a shift in tone when I talk to bankers about the bank regulatory environment. Bankers are cautiously optimistic that we will see meaningful reform that right-sizes regulation and supervisory approach, reforms that\u00e2\u0080\u0094if executed appropriately\u00e2\u0080\u0094should help the banking system promote economic growth in a safe and sound manner. Today, I will share my views on a number of issues related to banking regulation and supervision, including the importance of tailoring, having a problem-focused approach to bank regulation and supervision, and the imperative of innovation in the banking system.\nOne of the unique characteristics of the U.S. banking system is the broad scope of institutions it includes and the wide range of customers and communities it serves. Given this wide variety of institutions, regulators must strive to foster a financial system that enables each and every bank, no matter its size, to thrive, supporting a vibrant economy and financial system. We must also be sensitive to emerging issues and trends that require attention, whether that be unintended consequences from capital requirements, the incentives created by our approach to regulatory applications, and to ensure legal compliance.\nTailoring\nThe approach to regulation and supervision should promote a healthy and vibrant banking system. One key element of a regulatory approach that does so, and one that I often highlight, is the use of \"tailoring\" in the regulatory framework. For those familiar with my philosophy on bank regulation and supervision, my interest and focus on tailoring will come as no surprise.\n2\nIn its most basic form, it is difficult to disagree with the virtue of regulatory and supervisory tailoring\u00e2\u0080\u0094calibrating the requirements and expectations imposed on a firm based on its size, business model, risk profile, and complexity\u00e2\u0080\u0094as a reasonable, appropriate, and responsible approach for bank regulation and supervision. In fact, tailoring is embedded in the statutory fabric of the Federal Reserve's bank regulatory responsibilities.\n3\nThe bank regulatory framework inherently includes significant costs\u00e2\u0080\u0094both the cost of operating the banking agencies and the cost to the banking industry of complying with regulations, the examination process, and supplying information to regulators both through formal information collections and through one-off requests. In the aggregate, these costs can ultimately affect the price and availability of credit, geographic access to banking services, and the broader economy. The cost of this framework\u00e2\u0080\u0094both to regulators and to the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0094reflects layers of policy decisions over many years. But this framework could be more effective in balancing the mandate to promote safety and soundness with the need to have a banking system that promotes economic growth.\nLet's consider costs. As regulatory and supervisory demands grow, there is often parallel growth in the staff and budgets of the banking agencies. We should not only be cognizant of these costs, but we should act in a way that requires efficiency while ensuring safety and soundness. Some degree of elasticity in regulator capacity is necessary to respond to evolving economic and banking conditions, as well as emerging risks, but there must be reasonable constraints on banking agency growth. Expansion of the regulatory framework is not a cost-free endeavor. These costs are shouldered by taxpayers, banks, and, ultimately, bank customers.\nThe bank regulatory framework has great potential to provide significant benefits, including supporting an innovative banking system that enhances trust and confidence in our institutions and promotes safety and soundness. When we consider the benefits and the costs, we can institute greater efficiencies in both banking regulation and in the banking industry itself. The framework is complex, and the various elements of this framework are intended to work in a complementary way. As banks evolve\u00e2\u0080\u0094by growing larger or by engaging in new activities\u00e2\u0080\u0094tailoring can help us to quickly recalibrate requirements in light of the new risks posed by the firm.\nBut the regulatory framework, especially how supervisors prioritize its application to the banking industry, can pose a serious threat to a bank's viability. For example, imposing the same regulatory requirements on banks with assets of $2 billion to $2 trillion under the new rules implementing the Community Reinvestment Act demonstrated a missed opportunity to promote greater effectiveness and efficiency.\n4\nI question the wisdom of applying the same evaluation standards to banks within such a broad range.\nLikewise, supervisory guidance can provide fertile ground to differentiate supervisory expectations under a more tailored approach. While supervisory guidance is not binding on banks as a legal matter, it can signal how regulators think about particular risks and activities, and often drives community banks to reallocate resources in a way that may not be necessary or appropriate. The Fed's guidance on third-party risk management is an example of this. Originally, this guidance was published in a way that applied to all banks, including community banks. Yet it was acknowledged even at the time of publication that it had known shortcomings, particularly in terms of its administration and lack of clarity for community banks.\n5\nTailoring is important for all banks, but it is particularly important for community banks. There are real costs not only to banks, but to communities, when the framework is insufficiently tailored, as community banks faced with excessive regulatory burdens may be forced to raise prices or seek to merge or be acquired. These banks often reach unbanked or underbanked corners of the U.S. economy, not only in terms of the customers they serve but also in terms of their geographic footprint. We are all familiar with banking deserts and the challenges many legitimate and law-abiding businesses and consumers have in accessing basic banking services and credit. It is difficult to imagine that a system with far fewer banks would as effectively serve U.S. banking and credit needs and sufficiently support economic growth.\nIt is imperative that we keep the benefits of tailoring in focus as the bank regulatory framework evolves. A tailored regulatory and supervisory approach can help inform our policies on a wide range of industry issues that are likely to emerge in the coming years.\nProblem-Based Solutions\nOne of the most difficult challenges on the regulatory front is prioritization, both for banks managing their businesses and for regulators deciding how to fulfill their responsibilities. At a basic level, the role of regulators is dictated by statute. Congress granted the Federal Reserve and other banking agencies broad statutory powers but has constrained how those powers may be directed through the use of statutory mandates, including to promote a safe and sound banking system, and broader U.S. financial stability. In the execution of these responsibilities, the Federal Reserve must also balance the need to act in a way that enables the banking system to serve the U.S. economy and promote economic growth. While these objectives are not incompatible, they do require us to consider tradeoffs when establishing policy.\nHow can regulators best meet these responsibilities? As many of you may already know, I strongly believe in a pragmatic approach to policymaking.\n6\nThis requires us to identify the problem we are trying to solve, determine whether we are the appropriate regulator to address the problem based on our statutory mandates and authorities, and explore options for addressing the identified issue.\nThis approach of pragmatic problem-solving also applies to supervision, where process improvements could improve functioning. The Federal Reserve exercises its supervisory responsibilities by supervisory portfolio, with each portfolio relying on a combination of Board and Reserve Bank staff.\n7\nIt is important that\nresponsibility\nfor supervisory decisions be paired with\naccountability\nfor such decisions, which can be complicated depending on the different roles played by Board and Reserve Bank staffs, and as institutions change supervisory portfolios. The misalignment of responsibility and accountability detracts from effective supervision.\nOur supervisory program should require strong examiner training, rely on examiner expertise in the conduct of examinations, and work in partnership with state bank supervisors. Doing so will allow us to leverage the practical experience and judgment of examination staff\u00e2\u0080\u0094characteristics that are necessary for effective supervision\u00e2\u0080\u0094while preserving the role of the Board to delegate and provide Reserve Bank oversight. Examinations cannot be just a box-checking exercise. We must rely on well-trained and experienced examiners empowered to exercise independent judgment and ask questions, which leads to stronger and more effective supervision.\nAs we look at the banking system, including the regulatory framework, we must focus on those issues that are most important to advancing statutory priorities. There is always the risk of misidentification and mis-prioritization, and that we fail to take appropriately robust action on key issues or focus on issues that are less material to a bank's safety and soundness. Our goal should be to develop a better filter to promote appropriate and effective prioritization.\nTreasury market functioning\nWhere regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we need to take a close look at whether those risks are justified by the safety and soundness benefits of the regulation. The erosion of liquidity in U.S. Treasury markets provides a good example of unintended consequences and the need to evaluate tradeoffs in regulation. This issue is a byproduct of several important dynamics: (1) the role of large banks in the intermediation of U.S. Treasury markets, (2) the growth of \"safe\" assets in the banking system, and (3) the increase in leverage-based capital requirements becoming the binding capital constraint on some large banks. While regulators may not have tools to address all of these dynamics, clearly the adverse impact of leverage-based capital requirements falls within the banking regulators' scope of responsibility.\nIssues with Treasury market functioning have been known for quite some time. We have seen a persistent trend of low liquidity in U.S. Treasury markets for several years, which has been noted in the Board's semiannual\nFinancial Stability Report\n.\n8\nLow liquidity can create more volatility in prices, exacerbate the effects of market shocks, and can threaten market functioning. Treasury market functioning and liquidity will likely be affected by the Securities and Exchange Commission's central clearing requirement for U.S. Treasuries, which may improve market functioning. In addition, the Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility may also help to promote smooth functioning in the Treasury market. But there is uncertainty regarding how the volume of Treasury securities issued and outstanding, and changes to the Fed's balance sheet over time, may affect this.\nWe have seen Treasury markets experience stress events as recently as the September 2019 repo market stress, and the so-called \"dash for cash\" in March of 2020. Both of these events raised concerns about the resiliency of U.S. Treasury markets. Therefore, we should continue to actively monitor indicators of market function, particularly whether Treasury market functioning improves over time, thereby enabling it to withstand future shocks.\nThe banking regulators are uniquely positioned to not only analyze but also remediate components of the bank regulatory framework that may exacerbate Treasury market illiquidity. Large bank-affiliated primary dealers play an important role in the intermediation of U.S. Treasury markets. These dealers are not immune or insulated from the effect of banking regulation. While many factors can affect market liquidity, including interest rate volatility and Treasury market saturation, we must consider whether some of the pressure is a byproduct of bank regulation.\nThe Federal Reserve has previously intervened to address market stress and support Treasury market functioning, for example, by temporarily excluding Fed reserves and Treasuries from the denominator of the supplemental leverage ratio (SLR).\n9\nTreasury markets play a critical role in the U.S. and global financial systems, and we should take action to address the unintended consequences of bank regulation, while ensuring the framework continues to promote safety, soundness, and financial stability.\n10\nLeverage ratios do not differentiate between the risk of certain asset classes or exposures, and therefore appropriately operate as a backstop to risk-based capital requirements. However, in periods of banks' balance sheet expansion\u00e2\u0080\u0094as during COVID-19 when we saw significant deposit inflows\u00e2\u0080\u0094leverage ratios can become the binding constraint on banks and their affiliates, increasing the amount of required capital based on increased balance sheet size regardless of risk. When constrained in this way, bank-affiliated primary dealers may pull back on market intermediation activities.\nWhere we can take proactive regulatory measures to ensure that primary dealers have adequate balance sheet capacity to intermediate Treasury markets, we should do so. This could include amending the leverage ratio and G-SIB surcharge regulations for the largest U.S. banks. Adopting regulatory changes to mitigate these concerns may not be sufficient to ensure market liquidity, but it would be an important step toward building resiliency in advance of future stress events. In my view, it would be better to fix the roof now, while the sun is shining, by addressing over-calibrated leverage ratio requirements, and considering the unintended consequences of any future capital reforms.\nStress testing\nI will now turn to another area that the Board has already identified as a priority for review\u00e2\u0080\u0094stress testing.

Evidence from the U.S. Labor Market\nVice Chair Philip N. Jefferson\nAt Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Professor O'Connell, for that kind introduction and for the opportunity to talk to this group.\n1\nI am delighted to be back at Swarthmore College. This special community brings back fond memories of fantastic students, great colleagues, and pedagogical excellence.\nSlide 1\nYesterday, I discussed my outlook for the current U.S. economy. I highlighted how the economy is growing and appears to be roughly in balance, with low unemployment and declining inflation. Today, I will review some of the historical evidence pertaining to periods when the Federal Reserve has achieved both components of its dual mandate, maximum employment and stable prices, on a sustained basis\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, periods of long non-inflationary economic expansions. My title question is whether economic evidence indicates that such expansions also result in greater shared prosperity.\nMy\nfocus\nwill be on the labor market. A reason for this focus is that for many individuals, their employment attachment is a key determinant of their household's overall well-being. My approach will be to compare the current labor market with the labor market at the end of 2019\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, at the end of the most recent long, non-inflationary expansion. Such a comparison provides a lens through which to view the prospects for broadly shared prosperity fostered by the current U.S. labor market.\nThe remainder of my talk is organized as follows. First, I describe the labor market at the end of 2019. After that, I discuss the state of the labor market in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, I describe the current labor market situation. Next, I discuss possible reasons why strong labor markets facilitate broad-based prosperity. Before concluding, I consider whether the benefits of long expansions are persistent.\nThe Labor Market on the Eve of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nLet's begin the exploration of my title question with a careful look at the situation during the historically strong labor market on the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the 2007-09 Global Financial Crisis, the U.S. economy expanded for 128 consecutive months, making it the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. During this period, as shown in\nfigure 1\n, the aggregate unemployment rate fell steadily from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009 to 3.5 percent in September 2019, the lowest recorded in nearly 50 years. Job opportunities were plentiful in this strong labor market, with the ratio of vacancies to job seekers hovering around 1.2 throughout 2019, implying that businesses were seeking to fill more open positions than there were workers actively searching for employment. Moreover, while some long economic expansions have led to an unwelcome rise in prices, inflation remained low and stable. Indeed, the Federal Reserve was grappling with inflation somewhat below, rather than above, its longer-run 2 percent target.\nIn addition, and perhaps related to the length of the expansion, the pre-pandemic labor market was remarkable in terms of the broad-based gains seen across demographic groups, which contributed to a historic narrowing of employment disparities. For instance, as shown in\nfigure 2\n, the unemployment rate among African Americans, the solid red line, has usually been about twice as high as that for white individuals, the solid blue line, and is more sensitive to the state of the business cycle. The unemployment rate among Hispanics, the dotted green line, falls between these two groups. In late 2019, however, both African American and Hispanic unemployment rates had fallen to the lowest levels on record up to that point, significantly narrowing the persistent unemployment gaps between these groups. Before this, the greatest improvement in the unemployment rate among African Americans was at the end of the 1991\u00e2\u0080\u00932001 economic expansion, which itself was the second longest expansion in U.S. history. But in 2019, the unemployment rate for African Americans was about 2 percentage points lower than it was in early 2001.\nThe influence of the long expansion on employment gaps also was evident for other groups of workers. Like minorities, individuals with less education, and especially those who have not completed high school, also experience higher cyclical volatility in their employment.\n2\nIn 2019, as shown in\nfigure 3\n, the unemployment rate gaps between workers with less than a high school education, the solid red line, and those who have attained at least a bachelor's degree, the solid purple line, also were near multidecade lows. Further, the strong labor market created new opportunities for teens and younger workers, groups whose employment prospects, and even long-term career trajectories, are especially sensitive to the cyclical state of the economy.\n3\nBeyond narrowing gaps between workers actively searching for a job, the strong pre-pandemic labor market also helped draw many new participants into the labor force. Among prime-age workers, those aged 25 to 54, the labor force participation rate began rising again around 2015, as shown in\nfigure 4\n, reversing a declining trend. This was true among both men, the solid black line, whose participation had been steadily declining since the 1950s, and women, the dashed red line, whose participation had previously peaked in early 2000. Labor force participation among women was rising especially briskly in the months just before the pandemic, essentially reversing its entire decline over the previous 20 years. While this partially reflects broader demographic trends such as increasing educational attainment, participation was rising for both women with and without a college degree after 2015, suggesting that the strong labor market played a part in this reversal.\nTurning now from employment and participation to earnings, nominal wages were growing solidly before the pandemic. As with gains in employment, the strong labor market was especially beneficial for some groups. Most noticeably, as shown in\nfigure 5\n, wage growth for the bottom quartile of earners, the solid red line, started to pick up about five years into the expansion, in late 2014, and by 2019 was significantly stronger than for workers in higher earnings quartiles, the solid purple line.\n4\nThese differences in wage growth are important, as they imply convergence in levels and, therefore, declining wage inequality as the bottom of the distribution catches up to higher earners. Similarly, wages were growing faster for non-white workers relative to white workers in 2019, though differences by educational attainment were less pronounced at the time.\nLooking back now, the U.S. economy in 2019 was in a good place. The labor market was tight but not overheating, bringing widespread gains to workers. Further, had it not been for the sudden and dramatic interruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, this strong labor market was expected to persist. In December 2019, the median Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participant expected the aggregate unemployment rate to remain below 4 percent through the end of 2022 while inflation was expected to move back up to the Committee's 2 percent objective.\n5\nHad this long, non-inflationary expansion continued as the Committee forecast, gaps in employment and earnings across groups may have continued to narrow as well.\nThe Labor Market Following the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe expansion, however, was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, the unemployment rate, as shown in\nfigure 6\n, briefly surged to 14.8 percent, its highest rate since the Great Depression while the share of Americans seeking jobs (not shown) plummeted. Moreover, those same groups that had benefited from the strong pre-pandemic labor market\u00e2\u0080\u0094African American and Hispanic workers, women, and individuals without a college degree\u00e2\u0080\u0094generally fared worse at the onset of the pandemic. Although some of these groups typically experience greater losses in economic downturns, factors unique to the pandemic, including greater exposure to the industries most affected by lockdowns, also contributed to disparities in job losses. For instance, unlike a typical recession, the pandemic disproportionately affected service industries, which employ a larger share of women than industries like construction and manufacturing, which are generally more cyclically sensitive.\nJust as the pandemic itself led to unprecedented losses in the labor market, the subsequent recovery was unprecedented in many ways. As the health risk abated and the economy reopened, labor demand surged as businesses attempted to re-hire workers, but many workers remained on the sidelines. By late 2021, the labor force participation rate was still well below its pre-pandemic level. Vacancies rose to record levels, while, at the same time, quits, as shown in\nfigure 7\n, surged as workers sought out new job opportunities, leading some to refer to the post-pandemic recovery as the \"Great Resignation.\" Consequently, as shown in\nfigure 8\n, the gap between available jobs, the solid black line, and available workers, the dashed red line, which had been just over 1 million positions in late 2019, widened to over 6 million, the equivalent of two job openings for every unemployed worker. This was an exceptionally tight labor market, far exceeding any in recent history, including the labor market before the pandemic.\nThe strong post-pandemic aggregate economy reversed the disparities between groups that initially widened in 2020. The aggregate unemployment rate fell to 3.4 percent in April 2023, its lowest since 1969. That same month, the unemployment rate for African Americans fell to 4.8 percent, the lowest level on record and 1/2 percentage point below the previous record set in 2019, as shown in\nfigure 9\nby the red solid line, which is the difference between the unemployment rate for African Americans and its own average in the year 2019.\nAlthough labor force participation was initially slower to recover, the labor force participation rate among prime-age women climbed to its highest level ever in 2023, well above even pre-pandemic levels, as shown in\nfigure 10\nby the red dashed line, which is the difference between the labor force participation rate for women and its own average in the year 2019.\nThe tight labor market also led to a surge in nominal wage growth, especially for workers lower in the earnings distribution. In fact, as shown in\nfigure 11\n, wage growth for low-wage workers, the solid red line, was strong enough, with a peak wage growth close to 7.5 percent in 2022, to drive a meaningful compression in the aggregate wage distribution (not shown). Economic research suggests that the pandemic recovery reversed around one-third of the increase in the aggregate ratio of the 90th percentile to the 10th percentile wage inequality since the 1980s.\n6\nThese gains at the bottom of the income distribution also were reflected in the experience of different demographic groups, as shown in\nfigure 12\n, with stronger wage growth for nonwhite workers, the dashed red line, relative to white workers, the solid black line, and, unlike even the pre-pandemic expansion, for workers with a high school education or less relative to those with a bachelor's degree or more.\nUnlike the noninflationary pre-pandemic expansion, however, these nominal wage gains coincided with rising prices, reducing many workers' actual purchasing power. Real wage growth deflated by the personal consumption expenditures price index, which adjusts for the effect of inflation on workers' purchasing power, was negative for many workers in 2022, despite strong aggregate employment growth. Further, the costs of inflation also vary across groups, and there is evidence that rising prices may hurt lower-income populations more.\n7\nThis underscores the connection between the two components of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to promote both maximum employment and stable prices, since the benefits of strong labor markets are eroded when accompanied by an unwelcome rise in inflation.\nThe Current Labor Market Situation\nLet me turn now to the labor market situation more recently. As the economy has recovered from the pandemic, the labor market has come into better balance. By mid-2024, the gap between available jobs and available workers\u00e2\u0080\u0094I'll show that\nfigure again\nhere\u00e2\u0080\u0094had essentially returned to where it was in 2019, reflecting both a decline in vacancies and improvements in labor supply. Various indicators pointed to a labor market that was still tight, but no longer overheating.\nCurrently, the labor market remains solid, on balance, and inflation continues a bumpy descent toward the FOMC's 2 percent objective. Layoff activity and initial claims for unemployment insurance, shown in\nfigure 13\n, remain low by historical standards even as job openings have moved down to more normal levels. The unemployment rate appears to have leveled off close to what the median FOMC participant currently sees as its long-run sustainable level of 4.2 percent.\n8\nWhile employment gaps between certain demographic groups have widened a touch since 2022, they remain historically narrow. Further, a welcome development as inflation has moderated is that real wage growth has picked up even as nominal wage growth has slowed. Though wages are now growing similarly across demographic groups, the narrowing of the wage gap across demographic groups realized in 2021 and 2022 persists.\nHow Do Strong Labor Markets Facilitate Broad-Based Prosperity?\nLooking back at long, noninflationary episodes like the pre-pandemic expansion raises the question of why strong labor markets have been especially beneficial for certain demographic groups. Although the literature has not reached a definite conclusion to this question, researchers have pointed to several economic mechanisms that may help explain these patterns.\nIn 1973, the economist Arthur Okun argued that \"high-pressure\" labor markets\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as those in 2019 and during the pandemic recovery\u00e2\u0080\u0094allowed workers to move up the job ladder, creating new opportunities for individuals on the margins of the labor market.\n9\n,\n10\nFurther, he argued that when job openings are difficult to fill, employers relax hiring standards, creating new opportunities for individuals who otherwise might struggle to find employment. Consistent with this argument, economic research shows that as the labor market strengthened from 2010 to 2014, employers reduced education and experience requirements in online job postings.\n11\nEconomic research also highlights the role of more productive job-worker matches as ",

Jefferson\nAt the Economics Department Special Lecture, Lafayette College, Easton, Pennsylvania\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Professor Smith. It is an honor to be speaking to you today here at Lafayette College.\n1\nI am glad to have the opportunity to return to such a historically important place as Easton, Pennsylvania, and the Lehigh Valley. This area was part of this country's colonial beginnings, it was instrumental in the rising of the industrial age, and, as the home to Crayola, it very literally played a role in coloring how we see the world. Today, this region is leading the way forward with its many outstanding institutions of higher education, very prominently including, of course, Lafayette College.\nSlide 1\nToday, I would like to take this opportunity to share with you my outlook for the U.S. economy and my views of appropriate monetary policy. This is a useful time to do that, as my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Federal Reserve's primary monetary policymaking body, held our first meeting of 2025 just last week.\nOverall, the U.S. economy is starting the year in a good position. I expect inflation's slow descent to continue, and I anticipate that economic growth and labor market conditions will remain solid. I have learned, however, that it is wise to be humble about my projections. There is always a great deal of uncertainty around any economic forecast, and currently we face additional uncertainties about the exact shape of government policies, as well as their economic implications.\nLast week, my FOMC colleagues and I discussed the latest economic developments and reviewed data that arrived since our previous policy meeting in December. At the conclusion of that meeting, I voted in support of the Committee's decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. This decision was made in support of our goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. I remain focused on setting policy to achieve the dual-mandate goals given to us by Congress: maximum employment and stable prices. Sound monetary policy and positive supply-side developments have contributed to the achievement of sustained economic growth in recent years, the return of low unemployment, and inflation moving sustainably toward our 2 percent objective. I remain committed to returning inflation to our target while sustaining the solid labor market. Now is an appropriate time to assess the path forward for the economy. I am happy to be here today to share my views with you.\nEconomic Activity\nThe U.S. economy appears to be maintaining its momentum after growing at a solid pace last year. Last year's growth was notable because many private forecasters in 2023 projected a significant downturn sometime in 2024.\n2\nHowever, data over the past year painted a very different picture. GDP grew 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to last week's data release.\n3\nAs you can see in\nfigure 1\n, that extends a stretch of solid quarterly growth over the past couple of years. Shortly, when I discuss the labor market, I will say more related to the large swing in GDP growth in 2020 that stands out in this chart. For all of 2024, the economy grew 2.5 percent, which is a modest slowing from the 3.2 percent growth in 2023. The economy has been benefiting from positive supply developments, including more workers joining the labor force and higher labor productivity.\nThe resilience of American consumers is the driving force behind the solid economic growth seen in recent quarters. Household spending, adjusted for inflation, grew 3.2 percent in 2024, slightly stronger than in 2023. The consumer spending data we have received recently have surprised me to the upside. As you can see in\nfigure 2\n, personal consumption increased at a faster pace each quarter last year. Nominal retail sales rose briskly in the second half of last year. Private-sector data are consistent with GDP figures. According to private surveys of businesses, activity in the services sector, which accounts for about two-thirds of all consumer spending, has been on a general upward trajectory since mid-2020.\n4\nElsewhere in the economy, growth has been less robust. Residential investment has been fairly flat over the past three quarters, and growth of business fixed investment cooled last year from its strong 2023 pace. Much of the equipment investment that did take place came from imports. Indeed, domestic manufacturing industrial production was flat last year. Overall, I see the economy as continuing to grow at a healthy pace this year, though I anticipate growth to be slightly lower than what we observed in 2024. Households and firms face an uncertain environment, and that tends to lower consumer spending and business investment. If consumer spending continues to grow at the same pace as it has in the past two years, however, that could cause me to revise up my outlook for overall economic growth.\nLabor Market\nTurning to employment, I see the labor market as being in a solid position, with conditions broadly returning to balance after a period of being overheated. It's helpful to step back and look at the labor market's path over the past five years. Looking at\nfigure 3\n, you can see that the unemployment rate surged in early 2020, peaking at 14.8 percent in April 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic first took hold and a wide swath of the global economy was shutdown. The unemployment rate subsequently fell swiftly as the economy recovered. By April 2023, it touched 3.4 percent, a half-century low. At that point, many employers reported that they were struggling to fill openings. Then, over the latter part of 2023 and early 2024, the unemployment rate rose nearly a percentage point, an unusual pattern outside of a recession. As a policymaker, I took note of this rise when considering our dual-mandate objectives. Now, I have also taken note that the unemployment rate has effectively held steady since the middle of last year. I view that as a sign that downside risks in the labor market have abated.\nThe latest jobs report showed that the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in December, the same reading as in June 2024.\n5\nThat is low by historical standards and close to estimates of the longer-run rate that is consistent with our employment mandate. In the three months ending in December, payrolls rose by an average of 170,000 jobs a month. While employment growth has eased somewhat from the early part of last year, the steady unemployment rate suggests that payroll gains have been sufficient to absorb new entrants to the labor market. The general moderation in hiring is consistent with other measures showing that the demand for labor has come into better balance with the supply of workers.\nLooking at\nfigure 4\n, you can see that as of November, there were 1.2 job openings for every unemployed person seeking work. That ratio is down from 2.0 in 2022, when the labor market was overheated. Also notice that the current vacancy-to-unemployment ratio is just a little below its value before the pandemic took hold. And while hiring has eased from the pace in 2023, layoffs have not increased. As you can see in\nfigure 5\n, the number of Americans seeking first-time unemployment benefits has trended at historically low levels for the past three years. Consistent with a moderation in hiring and a steady unemployment rate, workers' wage gains have slowed from when the labor market was overheated. Still, the pace of increase in average hourly earnings has been healthy, increasing 3.9 percent during the 12 months ending in December, and shows that, on average, worker pay has grown at a faster rate than the rate of inflation.\nLooking broadly across the past several months, I see a labor market that is in solid condition and not a source of significant inflationary pressure. While the downside risks of a rapidly weakening labor market appear to have lessened, I expect some further softening that could cause the unemployment rate to edge just slightly higher this year but stay in a range consistent with recent readings.\nInflation\nThinking about the other component of our dual mandate, inflation has come down a great deal over the past two and a half years but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent objective. Inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, peaked at 7.2 percent in June 2022. Looking at the blue line in\nfigure 6\n, you can see that it has since come down to 2.6 percent as of this past December. Economists also pay close attention to core inflation, which excludes often volatile food and energy costs. That core PCE inflation figure, shown by the red dashed line, peaked at 5.6 percent in 2022. By December 2024, it had eased to 2.8 percent. Annualized inflation over the past three months has been closer to our 2 percent objective. As you can see, the path of disinflation has been bumpy. I expect that to continue to be the case.\nI find it helpful to look at the components of inflation to better understand underlying trends. Looking at\nfigure 7\n, core goods inflation, the blue line, is running close to pre-pandemic levels, reflecting a better alignment between supply and demand after pandemic-related distortions. Nonhousing services inflation, the red dashed line, has cooled largely in line with slower wage growth. Housing services inflation, the purple dotted line, remains somewhat elevated, but I expect more progress in that category as the earlier slowing in growth of rents for new tenants feeds through into growth of average rents.\n6\nWith supply and demand conditions having moved into better balance, wage growth slowing to a more sustainable pace, and longer-term inflation expectations remaining well anchored, I see a path for inflation to continue its progress toward our longer-run goal. While the easing of overall inflation in recent years has been encouraging, the fact is that it remains above our 2 percent objective. Monthly inflation readings tend to be volatile, consistent with the bumpy path I described, but the 12-month readings have held in a fairly consistent range somewhat above our target over the second half of last year.\nMonetary Policy\nIn the current environment, I attach a high degree of uncertainty to my projections. As I have already mentioned, there have been notable recent instances where forecasters have been surprised. That said, I see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and I am attentive to the risks to both sides of our mandate. That better balanced position is partly a result of the monetary policy actions over the past few years, which I will review briefly.\nAs you can see in\nfigure 8\n, the FOMC responded to elevated inflation by raising the policy rate 5-1/4 percentage points over about 15 months, starting in March 2022, and then holding the rate at that restrictive level for more than a year. This contributed to inflation easing from a 40-year high to near current levels while maintaining a solid labor market. That outcome was historically unusual but greatly welcomed. By September of last year, I had growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market could be maintained in a context of moderate economic growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent. The FOMC reduced the federal funds rate by a full percentage point over the course of our final three meetings last year. As a result of those actions, our policy stance is now significantly less restrictive than it was when we began lowering the federal funds rate. Given current economic conditions\u00e2\u0080\u0094specifically, inflation that remains modestly above our target and a labor market that is solid\u00e2\u0080\u0094and my projections of future economic conditions, I voted last week to maintain our current policy stance. As long as the economy and labor market remain strong, I see it as appropriate for the Committee to be cautious in making further adjustments.\nOver the medium term, I continue to see a gradual reduction in the level of monetary policy restraint placed on the economy as we move toward a more neutral stance as the most likely outcome. That said, I do not think we need to be in a hurry to change our stance. In considering additional adjustments to the federal funds rate, I will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. As is always the case, monetary policy is not on a preset course. To that end, I could envision a range of scenarios for future policy. For example, if the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer.\nAlternatively, if the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, it may be appropriate to reduce the policy rate more quickly. Our current stance of policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.\nAs I conclude, I want to assure you that I am mindful that monetary policy decisions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. I highly value opportunities to visit places like Lafayette College and Easton to share my views, hear from you, and see how the economy is experienced firsthand in your community. I remain fully committed to supporting maximum employment and bringing inflation sustainably to our 2\u00e2\u0080\u00afpercent goal. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.\nThank you.\nSlide 10\n1.

Bowman\nAt The New England CEO Summit, Portsmouth, New Hampshire\nShare\nLet me begin by saying my thoughts and prayers are with the families of the passengers and crew who perished in the tragic flight accident in Washington, D.C. Wednesday evening.\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you today.\n1\nIt is a pleasure to be with you virtually for your CEO Summit. I always enjoy the opportunity to meet bankers from across the country, especially New England, to learn about the issues that are important to you. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded its January meeting earlier this week, so I will begin by offering some brief remarks on the economy, and then share my views on a number of mutual and community bank issues, before addressing some questions that were submitted by your members in advance of today's meeting.\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting\nAt our FOMC meeting this week, my colleagues and I voted to hold the federal funds rate target range at 4-1/4 to 4\u00e2\u0080\u00911/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. I supported this action because, after recalibrating the level of the policy rate towards the end of last year to reflect the progress made since 2023 on lowering inflation and cooling the labor market, I think that policy is now in a good place to position the Committee to pay closer attention to the inflation data as it evolves.\nLooking ahead to 2025, in my view, the current policy stance also provides the opportunity to review further indicators of economic activity and get clarity on the administration's policies and their effects on the economy. It will be very important to have a better sense of the actual policies and how they will be implemented, in addition to greater confidence about how the economy will respond.\nBrief Remarks on the Economy\nThe U.S. economy remained strong through the end of last year, with solid growth in economic activity and a labor market near full employment. Core inflation remains elevated, but my expectation is that it will moderate further this year. Even with this outlook, I continue to see upside risks to inflation.\nThe rate of inflation declined significantly in 2023, but it slowed by noticeably less last year. Without having seen the December data released this morning, I estimate that the 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094which excludes food and energy prices\u00e2\u0080\u0094likely remained unchanged at 2.8 percent in December, only slightly below its 3.0 percent reading at the end of 2023. Progress has been slow and uneven since the spring of last year mostly due to a slowing in core goods price declines.\nAfter increasing at a solid pace, on average, over the initial three quarters of last year, gross domestic product appears to have risen a bit more slowly in the fourth quarter, reflecting a large drop in inventory investment, which is a volatile category. In contrast, private domestic final purchases, which provide a better signal about underlying growth in economic activity, maintained its strong momentum from earlier in the year, as personal consumption rose robustly again in the fourth quarter.\nSome measures of consumer sentiment appear to have improved recently but are still well below pre-pandemic levels, likely because of higher prices. And since housing, food, and energy price increases have far outpaced overall inflation since the pandemic, lower-income households have experienced the negative impacts of inflation hardest, especially as these households have limited options to trade down for lower-cost goods and services.\nPayroll employment gains rebounded strongly in December and averaged about 170,000 per month in the fourth quarter, a pace that is somewhat above average gains in the prior two quarters. The unemployment rate edged back down to 4.1 percent in December and has moved sideways since last June, remaining slightly below my estimate of full employment.\nThe labor market appears to have stabilized in the second half of last year, after having loosened from extremely tight conditions. The rise in the unemployment rate since mid-2023 largely reflected weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs have remained low. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has remained close to the pre-pandemic level in recent months, and there are still more available jobs than available workers. The labor market no longer appears to be especially tight, but wage growth remains somewhat above the pace consistent with our inflation goal.\nI hope the revision of the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor data, which will be released next week, will more accurately capture the changing dynamics of immigration and net business creation and bring more clarity on the underlying pace of job growth. It is crucial that U.S. official data accurately capture structural changes in labor markets in real time, such as those in recent years, so we can more confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic policymaking. In the meantime, given conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and significant data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.\nAssuming the economy evolves as I expect, I think that inflation will slow further this year. Its progress may be bumpy and uneven, and the upcoming inflation data for the first quarter will be an important indication of how quickly this will happen. That said, I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market remains near full employment.\nDespite the prospect for some reduction in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Asia, global supply chains continue to be susceptible to disruptions, which could result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. In addition, the release of pent-up demand following the election, especially with improving consumer and business sentiment, could lead to stronger economic activity, which could increase inflationary pressures.\nThe Path Forward\nAs we enter a new phase in the process of moving the federal funds rate toward a more neutral policy stance, I would prefer that future adjustments to the policy rate be gradual. We should take time to carefully assess the progress in achieving our inflation and employment goals and consider changes to the policy rate based on how the data evolves.\nGiven the current stance of policy, I continue to be concerned that easier financial conditions over the past year may have contributed to the lack of further progress on slowing inflation. In light of the ongoing strength in the economy and with equity prices substantially higher than a year ago, it seems unlikely that the overall level of interest rates and borrowing costs are exerting meaningful restraint.\nI am also closely watching the increase in longer-term Treasury yields since we started the recalibration of our policy stance at the September meeting. Some have interpreted it as a reflection of investors' concerns about the possibility of tighter-than-expected policy that may be required to address inflationary pressures. In light of these considerations, I continue to prefer a cautious and gradual approach to adjusting policy.\nThere is still more work to be done to bring inflation closer to our 2 percent goal. I would like to see progress in lowering inflation resume before we make further adjustments to the target range. We need to keep inflation in focus while the labor market appears to be in balance and the unemployment rate continues to be at historically low levels. By the time of our March meeting, we will have received two inflation and two employment reports. I look forward to reviewing the first quarter inflation data, which, as I noted earlier, will be key to understanding the path of inflation going forward. I do expect that inflation will begin to decline again and that by year-end it will be lower than where it now stands.\nLooking forward, it is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance.\nBringing inflation in line with our price stability goal is essential for sustaining a healthy labor market and fostering an economy that works for everyone in the longer run.\nPerspective on Mutual and Community Banks\nTurning to banking, I will start with a brief discussion of the important role of mutual banks in the banking system before addressing other bank regulatory issues. One of the unique characteristics of the U.S. banking system is the broad scope of institutions it includes and the wide range of customers and communities it serves. Given this institutional diversity, regulators must strive to foster a financial system that enables each and every bank, no matter its size, to thrive, supporting a vibrant economy and financial system.\nMutual Bank Issues\nIn the Northeast, everyone is familiar with mutual banks given their significant presence in this region. Since the early 1800s, these banks have been dedicated to serving their local communities.\n2\nTheir ownership structure differs from traditional banks in that mutuals are owned by their depositors, rather than by shareholders. Like other community banks, they focus on local issues that are important to their communities and to their depositors.\nMany of the challenges mutual banks face are similar to those faced by other financial institutions, including competition from other banks, credit unions, and non-banks. But mutual banks also face unique issues that can add cost and expense to their operations. Two issues I would like to discuss are the challenges mutual institutions face raising capital, and unique procedural hurdles mutuals face in managing the dividend process. While these issues are unique to mutuals, both highlight the challenges of a lack of transparency, and insufficient focus on efficiency.\n3\nJust as with other community banks, a challenge for many mutuals is the difficulty of raising additional capital. This difficulty is exacerbated by their ownership structure, which typically requires mutuals to rely heavily on retained earnings. Although mutual institutions have historically been more highly capitalized relative to their stock-owned peers, if a mutual capital raise is needed, it would be helpful to provide some regulatory flexibility in the process. Recently, some mutuals have issued subordinated debt as a form of capital, but another form of regulatory capital may be preferable: mutual capital certificates.\nTo date, it has been unclear whether mutual capital certificates qualify as regulatory capital. These instruments could provide mutual banks an additional way to raise capital without disrupting their mutual structure. In my view, the banking agencies should be receptive to these kinds of instruments to ensure that mutual banks can both raise capital and maintain their depositor-owned structure. Mutuals need clarity and transparency about the regulatory treatment of these instruments and whether they qualify as regulatory capital.\nAnother concern for mutuals is the annual requirement to receive regulatory approval for a mutual holding company's waiver of a dividend issued by its subsidiary bank.\n4\nThe Board practice is to require a mutual holding company to submit an application each year to implement a waiver. This prior approval requirement is complex and imposes significant costs on these small institutions, reducing the investment they can make in their communities. Because of the time and expense of these waiver requirements, it is possible that the inefficiencies of the required application process erode the value of a mutual holding company structure, which would further constrain a mutual bank's ability to raise capital.\nSince the Board has nearly 20 years of experience considering these waiver requests, it seems appropriate to consider whether the applications process for these waivers is efficient. What lessons have we learned? Is the prior approval requirement effective in its review of holding companies waiving receipt of their dividends, or can this be resolved in a more efficient and cost effective manner? In my view, the Board should consider whether this process is effective and efficient in addressing concerns related to dividend waivers.\nMutual banks, like all community banks, are vital to the economic success of their communities. It is critical that our applications process not act as a limit on a particular type of institution simply due to regulatory inaction or lack of clarity and transparency. Regulators must find efficient and effective ways to support a vibrant and diverse banking system that enables these and other small institutions to thrive while supporting and investing in their local economy.\nTailoring\nTransparency and efficiency are just two of the necessary components of a regulatory approach that promotes a healthy and vibrant banking system. Another component that I speak about frequently is the use of \"tailoring\" in the regulatory framework. For those familiar with my philosophy on bank regulation and supervision, my interest and focus on tailoring will come as no surprise.\n5\nIn its most basic form, it is difficult to disagree with the virtue of regulatory and supervisory tailoring\u00e2\u0080\u0094calibrating the requirements and expectations imposed on a firm based on its size, business model, risk profile, and complexity\u00e2\u0080\u0094as a reasonable, appropriate and responsible approach for bank regulation and supervision. In fact, tailoring is embedded in the statutory fabric of the Federal Reserve's bank regulatory responsibilities.\n6\nThe bank regulatory framework inherently includes significant costs\u00e2\u0080\u0094both the cost of operating the banking agencies, and the cost to the banking industry of complying with regulations, the examination process, and supplying information to regulators both through formal information collections and through one-off requests. In the aggregate, these costs can ultimately affect the price and availability of credit, geographic access to banking services, and the broader economy. The cost of this framework\u00e2\u0080\u0094both to regulators and to the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0094reflects layers of policy decisions over many years. But this framework could be more effective in balancing",

Bowman\nAt the California Bankers Association 2025 Bank Presidents Seminar, Laguna Beach, California\nShare\nLet me begin by recognizing the devastation caused by the fires in the Los Angeles area. My thoughts and prayers are with those who have been impacted and the first responders who are fighting to bring the fires under control.\nI would like to thank the California Bankers Association for the invitation to speak to you today.\n1\nI appreciate the opportunity to reflect on the past year, on both the path of monetary policy and the economy and on how this past experience can inform the bank regulatory agenda as we look ahead to a new year.\nIn light of the policy decisions at the last few Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, I will begin by providing some perspective on my votes and then discuss my current views on the economy and monetary policy.\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC Meetings\nAt the September meeting last year, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate, for the first time since we began tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. Although I was unable to support such a large cut at that time, I did agree with the Committee's assessment that it was appropriate to begin the process of recalibrating policy to reflect the progress in both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market since the middle of 2023.\nMy dissent favored a smaller initial cut to begin the recalibration process and was the first FOMC dissent by a Board member in nearly 20 years. I explained my reasoning in a statement published after the meeting that noted that moving the policy rate down too quickly would carry the risk of unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures. In addition, since inflation continues to hover well above our 2 percent goal, there was a real risk that the Committee's large policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate.\nAt both our November and December meetings, the Committee lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, bringing it to 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. I supported the December policy action because, in my view, it represented the Committee's final step in the policy recalibration phase. The target range now reflects 100 basis points of cuts since September, and the policy rate is now closer to my estimate of its neutral level, which is higher than before the pandemic. But given the lack of continued progress on lowering inflation and the ongoing strength in economic activity and in the labor market, I could have supported taking no action at the December meeting. Still, I am pleased that the post-meeting statement continued to reference a flexible and data-dependent approach for considering future policy adjustments. It is important that we remain focused on returning inflation to 2 percent.\nI expect that the coming months should bring clarity on the incoming administration's policies and the carry over of inflationary pressures from 2024, reflecting private spending decisions and an apparent faster spend-out of existing federal government appropriations in recent months. It will be very important to understand how these factors will affect economic activity and inflation going forward.\nThe Economy Towards the End of 2024 and Risks to the Outlook\nThe U.S. economy remained strong through the end of last year, with solid growth in economic activity and a labor market near full employment. However, core inflation remains elevated, and I continue to see upside risks to inflation.\nThe rate of inflation declined significantly in 2023, but this progress appears to have stalled last year with core inflation still uncomfortably above the Committee's 2 percent goal. The 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094which excludes food and energy prices\u00e2\u0080\u0094moved back up to 2.8 percent in October and November, only slightly below its 3.0 percent reading at the end of 2023. Progress has stalled since the spring of last year mostly due to a slowing in core goods price declines. Persistently elevated core inflation continues to reflect pressures on housing services prices, possibly due to an increase in demand for affordable housing amid an inelastic supply. It also appears to be originating from a few other major components in recent months, such as in goods and in services with imputed prices.\nGross domestic product increased at a solid pace in the third quarter, maintaining the momentum from the previous four quarters. Growth continued to be driven by private domestic final purchases, as personal consumption, and retail sales in particular, strongly increased in the third quarter, more than offsetting further weakness in housing activity due to high mortgage rates. The latest data suggest continued strength in consumer spending in the fourth quarter as retail sales and sales of light vehicles continued to rise appreciably.\nPost-election consumer sentiment appears to be improving, but it remains well below pre-pandemic levels likely because of higher prices. And since housing, food, and energy price increases have far outpaced overall inflation since the pandemic, lower-income households have experienced the negative impacts of inflation hardest, especially as these households have limited options to trade down for lower-cost goods and services.\nThe most recent labor market report shows that payroll employment gains rebounded in November, following a temporary drag in October from hurricanes Helene and Milton and the Boeing strike. On balance, job gains averaged about 130,000 over those two months, a pace only slightly below the average gains in the second and third quarters. The unemployment rate rose to a still low 4.2 percent in November, but it has moved sideways since July. While unemployment is notably higher than in 2023, it is still at a historically low level and below my and the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of full employment, and we will receive the December employment report tomorrow.\nThe labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has remained close to the historically elevated pre-pandemic level in recent months. But there are still more available jobs than available workers, a condition that before 2018 had only occurred twice for a prolonged period since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength. Wage growth remains indicative of a tight labor market and above the pace consistent with our inflation goal.\nThe rise in the unemployment rate last year largely reflected weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force took longer to find work, while layoffs remained low. Although there has been some cooling in labor demand and the labor force participation rate declined a bit further in November, the household survey may have failed to capture the usual seasonal hiring ahead of the holidays due to the unusually early survey week and the late Thanksgiving holiday.\nMore concerningly, the labor market data have become increasingly difficult to interpret, as surveys and other measurements struggle to incorporate large numbers of new workers and to accurately account for other influences. As the dynamics of immigration and business creation and closures continue to change, it has become increasingly difficult to interpret the monthly data from the payroll and household surveys. It is crucial that U.S. official data accurately capture structural changes in labor markets in real time, such as those in recent years, so we can more confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic policymaking. In the meantime, given conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and significant data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.\nTurning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market remains near full employment, but it is possible that we could see a deterioration in labor market conditions. Global supply chains continue to be susceptible to shocks, including labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, namely in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Asia, which could result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets.\nThe potential release of pent-up demand following the election, especially with improving consumer and business sentiment, could also present inflationary risks, as could an increased demand for housing given the long-standing limited supply, especially of affordable housing. While it is not my baseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation could continue to stall.\nThe Path Forward\nLooking ahead, we should be cautious in considering changes to the policy rate as we move toward a more neutral setting. Future actions should be based on a careful assessment of ongoing and sustained progress in achieving our goals, and we must be clear in our communication about how further changes are intended to affect economic conditions. We should also refrain from prejudging the incoming administration's future policies. Instead, we should wait for more clarity and then seek to understand the effects on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation.\nI also continue to be concerned that the current stance of policy may not be as restrictive as others may see it. Given the ongoing strength in the economy, it seems unlikely that the overall level of interest rates and borrowing costs are providing meaningful restraint. With equity prices more than 20 percent higher than a year ago, easier financial conditions may be contributing to the lack of further progress on slowing inflation. In fact, concerns about inflation risks seem to partly explain the recent notable increase in the 10-year Treasury yield back to values last seen in the spring of 2024. In light of these considerations, I continue to prefer a cautious and gradual approach to adjusting policy.\nLooking forward, it is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. By the time of our next meeting later this month, we will have seen new reports on consumer and producer price inflation. In addition to closely watching the incoming data and broader financial conditions, I will continue to meet with a broad range of contacts as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance.\nIt is also important to clearly explain how we consider progress in meeting our inflation and employment goals in our policy deliberations. Restoring price stability is essential for fostering a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term.\nApproach to Bank Regulatory Policy\nTurning to banking, I will start by sharing my thoughts on bank supervision and regulation. This year will see a transition in leadership at the banking agencies, and I expect that this will translate into a shift in priorities and approach. I am optimistic that by working collaboratively to focus on our statutory mandates, the banking agencies can improve how we fulfill our responsibilities in a fair, efficient, and accountable way. Adopting a more pragmatic approach to policymaking, one that imposes discipline in the exercise of the extensive powers and important responsibilities granted by Congress, would be most effective.\n2\nPublic debates about the bank regulatory framework routinely focus on whether regulators are being \"hard enough\" on banks, or whether the framework is too \"lenient.\" Framing the debate this way suggests a binary approach that ignores the known tradeoffs in any regulatory action\u00e2\u0080\u0094like raising capital requirements or downgrading a bank's management rating for minor issues to show \"toughness.\" This approach interprets a rational prioritization of regulatory matters as being too bank friendly. While policy views may differ, policy debates should not misinterpret the dynamic of how banks and regulators should operate. In short, bank regulation and supervision need not be an adversarial system, with banks and regulators acting in opposition. Rather, banks and regulators often have the shared goal of a banking system that is safe, sound, and effective, with each serving an important role in furthering these objectives.\nAs we move away from this type of binary thinking, that leaves the question of how regulators can best accomplish their statutory objectives. As a starting point, we must identify the objectives we are trying to achieve. In conducting bank regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve has the important responsibility of promoting the safe and sound operation of individual banks and the stability of the broader financial system. In many cases, these goals are complementary. When individual banks operate in a safe and sound manner, the banking system generally promotes the stability of the U.S. financial system.\nOf course, these objectives require a degree of balance if we want the banking system to serve the U.S. economy and facilitate economic growth. When we promote safety and soundness\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example by raising capital requirements\u00e2\u0080\u0094that has an effect on the aggregate lending capacity of the banking system and the availability of credit, particularly for less qualified borrowers. We must approach the task of bank regulation with an understanding and appreciation of these tradeoffs, coupled with an affirmative acknowledgment that the banking system is an important driver of business formation, economic expansion, and opportunity. We have the same responsibility to understand and appreciate the tradeoffs when we exercise our supervisory authority.\nI am optimistic about the future of banking in the United States and believe that the banking regulators can support the banking system by adopting a more pragmatic approach. While this is a non-exclusive list, I continue to believe the areas that we should focus on should include (1) prioritizing safety and soundness, (2) renewing our commitment to regulatory tailoring, and (3) increasing transparency.\n3\nPrioritization of Safety and Soundness\nIn 2024, bank regulators were still operating under the shadow of the 2023 bank failures, particularly the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).

Waller\nAt Lectures of the Governor, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Paris, France\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Alvaro, and thank you for the honor of initiating this new series of lectures from central bankers.\n1\nI will begin with a few words on the U.S. economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy. But on this occasion, I thought it appropriate to then widen my perspective, to address what I see as the leading challenges that OECD economies face that are of particular importance to central bankers in how we approach monetary policy and our other responsibilities.\nI continue to believe that the U.S. economy is on a solid footing. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been above 2 percent for eight of the last nine quarters and is expected to grow above 2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024. Despite this robust economic growth, the labor market softened over 2024, and employment is now near what I judge to be the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) maximum-employment objective. I have seen nothing in the data or forecasts that suggests the labor market will dramatically weaken over coming months.\nWith regard to inflation, after a period of rapid disinflation in 2022 and 2023, progress appears to have stalled in the final months of 2024. Our latest reading of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation is 2.8 percent for the 12 months ending in November. This is down just a bit from where it was a year earlier, at 3.2 percent. This minimal further progress has led to calls to slow or stop reducing the policy rate. However, I believe that inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2 percent goal over the medium term and that further reductions will be appropriate.\nLet me explain why I expect inflation to continue toward our goal. First, as we saw a year ago when inflation briefly increased, progress has been uneven, but disinflation is more apparent if one smooths through the recent upticks. To tease out the underlying trend in inflation, I often look at the six-month percent change in core PCE prices, which is 2.4 percent at an annual rate for November and has mostly been moving down toward 2 percent over the course of the year. Second, the monthly reading for November came in much lower than expected at 0.11 percent after rising 0.26 percent in October. Third, inflation in 2024 has largely been driven by increases in imputed prices, such as housing services and nonmarket services, which are estimated rather than directly observed and I consider a less reliable guide to the balance of supply and demand across all goods and services in the economy. These two categories represent about one-third of the core PCE basket. If you look at the prices associated with the other two-thirds of core PCE, they on average increased less than 2 percent over the past 12 months through November. I don't support ignoring our best measures of prices for housing and non-market services, but I find it notable that\nimputed\nprices, rather than\nobserved\nprices, were driving inflation in 2024 and thus expectations of the policy rate path. Finally, the higher inflation readings from early in 2024 will begin to drop out of inflation numbers in January. This should result in a significant step-down in the 12-month inflation numbers through March.\nLooking further forward, geopolitical conflict could boost prices, as it has at times in recent years. In addition, tariff proposals raise the possibility that a new source of upward pressure on inflation could emerge in the coming year. Projections of the economic impact of these possible policy changes vary widely. If, as I expect, tariffs do not have a significant or persistent effect on inflation, they are unlikely to affect my view of appropriate monetary policy. Of course, we need to see what policies are enacted before we can seriously consider their effects.\nSo what is my view? If the outlook evolves as I have described here, I will support continuing to cut our policy rate in 2025. The pace of those cuts will depend on how much progress we make on inflation, while keeping the labor market from weakening. Based on the most recent Summary of Economic Projections, the median of policymakers' expected appropriate policy rate this year implies two 25 basis point cuts.\n2\nBut the range of views is quite large, from no cuts to as many as five cuts for different FOMC participants. As always, the extent of further easing will depend on what the data tell us about progress toward 2 percent inflation, but my bottom-line message is that I believe more cuts will be appropriate.\nLet me now turn to what I consider some of the leading challenges that will frame monetary policy actions for OECD members in 2025 and beyond. Each of the issues I raise are sizable challenges for all OECD countries, but some are bigger challenges in some places than others. I have not tried to rank these challenges in importance, so please don't take any signal from the order in which they are raised.\nI will start with the ongoing challenge all central banks face in reaching our targets for inflation. While 12-month measures of headline inflation are close to target in most jurisdictions, most central banks target inflation in the medium term, and indicators of the trajectory of future price changes, such as core inflation, are still running persistently above target. Like the Federal Reserve, most central banks in OECD economies are gradually easing monetary policy as inflation falls. I believe policy is still restrictive in most cases, which should support the goals of policymakers to have inflation at their targets going forward.\nThis common challenge, in the months ahead, has its roots, as we all know, in the common experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic conditions before and during the pandemic varied widely across OECD economies, as did the focus, timing, and forcefulness of policy responses. The surge in inflation during the pandemic was the result of both supply and demand factors, and while the timing of the inflation surge varied across countries, the COVID inflation was largely a global phenomenon, as shown by research conducted by Federal Reserve staff.\n3\nA common factor that drove inflation across our economies was the disruption of goods production and delivery.\n4\nShortages of key components and waves of COVID variants repeatedly disrupted supply chains, causing inflation to persist. Fortunately, these disruptions have receded, and delivery times have returned to pre-pandemic levels. That said, there are many geopolitical factors that are still keeping deliveries of supplies volatile, which potentially could affect economic activity and inflation.\nAnother common experience has been the fiscal response to the pandemic. The extent to which the fiscal policies rolled out in support of households and businesses during the pandemic contributed to inflation is the subject of ongoing debate.\n5\nRegardless of their effects on inflation, fiscal policy actions across OECD countries led to a doubling and tripling of budget deficits as a percentage of GDP with even larger percentages in some places. Those deficits have steadily fallen since then but are still higher in many countries than before the pandemic, and debt levels have grown for many OECD members.\nAnother recent challenge for OECD economies is the widespread weakness in manufacturing. Manufacturing boomed in many places with the onset of the pandemic, when consumers switched their spending from in-person services to goods. But as businesses and economies reopened with the easing of pandemic-related restrictions, the swing to service spending by consumers began what has been a sustained slide in manufacturing in OECD economies. This slide has been compounded by three other factors. First, because manufacturing is capital intensive, interest rate increases over the past couple of years raised capital costs in this sector. As monetary policy eases across countries, this effect may unwind. Also, higher energy costs after Russia's attack on Ukraine have hurt manufacturing more than other sectors. And lastly, China's push to reduce its reliance on imports and expand its global market share in sectors such as autos has had a big impact across OECD economies. While the manufacturing sector is a smaller share of economic activity in the United States than in some other OECD countries, we shall see whether the weakness in global manufacturing is affected by the prospect of changes in trade policy in the U.S. and elsewhere. The extent and timing of tariffs are highly uncertain, as are the effects. Overall, the evolution of manufacturing adds uncertainty to the forecasts of central bankers' outlooks.\nA short-to-medium-term challenge that is and will remain widespread among OECD countries is geopolitical risk. Indexes of geopolitical risk suggest that risks are elevated, but not nearly as high as they were when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Today however, you certainly can't see much evidence for geopolitical risk affecting financial markets. But geopolitical risk will nevertheless remain a challenge that central bankers will need to keep in mind. The outbreak of war in Europe and, more recently, in the Middle East were shocking developments that continue to reverberate, as we have seen recently in Syria. It is unclear how these events will ultimately affect security, trade, and migration flows around the world. The fact that these conflicts have not affected the global economy to a greater extent than they have so far doesn't mean they can't and won't. Research shows that higher levels of geopolitical risk, and economic uncertainty more broadly, tend to foreshadow lower investment and employment.\n6\nI expect that central bankers in OECD economies will continue to consider geopolitical risk in the medium term.\nThe next challenge for central bankers that I would like to address also has both shorter and long-term dimensions to it, and that is something that I will refer to as a \"rethink of globalization.\" For close to a decade now, many countries have been reexamining the costs and benefits from steadily freer global movement in capital, labor, and goods that was the norm over previous decades. Although global trade has not decreased in the last decade, we have clearly seen changes in trade patterns, with more countries and firms putting greater emphasis on rerouting trade flows and shortening supply chains to avoid geopolitical risk and tariffs. This isn't simply the result of some failed ministerial meeting or bilateral conflict. Rather, it has been a persistent and widespread trend that has been under way for some time. The presumption that the increasingly tighter global integration of our economies and financial markets would inevitably continue is no longer as safe as it long was.\nAt the same time, I have refrained from calling this development, as some have, the \"end of globalization,\" because I don't believe that this will be the outcome. As I think about the 38 governments represented by the OECD and consider how this organization has grown in size and in the depth of its engagement on different issues, I would say that globalization is not going away. What I do expect, however, is there will be more thought and consideration among our leaders for how globalization affects the people we serve, with a more careful weighing of both the potential costs of closer integration and the potential benefits. As these decisions by governments are made, central bankers will need to be prepared to respond appropriately in setting monetary policy and promoting financial stability.\nAnother longer-term challenge involves demographic trends. What I mean here is the aging of populations in OECD countries, and, to some extent, everywhere else. While this is mainly a problem for fiscal authorities, it does have some ramifications for central bankers in terms of long-run growth rates, productivity, and asset prices.\nIn the United States, those between the ages of 16 and 54 were 72 percent of the population in 2003, 62.7 percent in 2023, and are projected to be 61 percent in 2033. Aging is happening even more quickly in some other OECD countries. This is a slow-moving development but, as populations age and move from working to retirement, employment and economic output fall. This by itself lowers per capita GDP, which can affect consumption, investment and inflation. As aging populations sell accumulated assets to support consumption, asset prices and interest rates will adjust as well, with the latter potentially affecting the central bank's estimate of the neutral policy rate. There are mitigants to soften the effect of aging populations, such as an increase in retirement age, immigration and higher productivity growth for younger workers. Again, these demographic factors are more important for fiscal policy, but there are spillovers to monetary policy.\nProductivity growth is another issue facing central bankers and I know has been the subject of conversations at OECD gatherings this past year. According to one set of estimates, labor productivity growth is responsible for more than half of the cumulative GDP growth in the United States since the end of 2019, compared to much smaller shares in other countries. Productivity growth is notoriously volatile and, even years later, it is hard to say exactly what technological and other factors caused it.\n7\nHaving some understanding of the trajectory of productivity growth is helpful for policymakers thinking about how fast their economies can grow without inducing inflation. Central bankers must keep their eyes on productivity in judging whether wages can grow quickly without igniting inflation or whether potential growth has increased. Productivity growth also plays a role in assessing the real neutral policy rate, otherwise known as r*. Higher productivity growth is often associated with a higher value of r* for some policymakers and thus has implications for the interpretation of the degree of monetary accommodation or restrictiveness for policy.\n8\nOne way to try to understand some of the factors affecting productivity is to compare the United States to other OECD countries. While it is not particularly new for productivity to grow faster in the U.S. than in other advanced economies, some differences in our economies may have been particularly salient during and after the pandemic.\n9\nFirst, there was more disruption in employment in the United States during COVID than in many other OECD countries and after the pandemic subsided this may have led to better matching of workers with new jobs at which they could be more productive.

Cook\nAt the Seventh Conference on Law and Macroeconomics, University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Dean Logue. It is wonderful to be back in my adopted home state of Michigan and on the University of Michigan's beautiful campus. The fact that you got this Georgia native to visit in the first week of January shows you just how much I love it here. But, seriously, the program committee for the University of Michigan Law School's Seventh Conference on Law and Macroeconomics has put together an impressive program. I am grateful for the opportunity to present my views and to learn from all of you.\n1\nToday, I would like to speak about the Federal Reserve Board's work on financial stability. It is a topic that holds special importance to me, because I am the chair of the Board of Governors' Committee on Financial Stability. But before speaking on financial stability, given that it is the beginning of a new year, I thought it would be helpful to share my economic outlook and my views on appropriate monetary policy.\nOverall, the U.S. economy starts the year in good shape. Economic growth was quite strong in 2024. Inflation has fallen considerably from its peak two and a half years ago, though it remains somewhat above the Fed's 2 percent objective. The labor market is solid, with the unemployment rate still relatively low and Americans, on average, bringing home paychecks that are growing faster than inflation.\nMy focus, and that of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is on our dual-mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment. This year, I will continue to work on calibrating monetary policy to ensure inflation returns sustainably to our 2 percent target while maintaining a solid labor market. I will also carefully monitor financial stability risks and vulnerabilities and work with my colleagues at the Fed and other agencies to reduce the likelihood that financial stability problems will disrupt the economy.\nEconomic Activity\nAs I stated, the economy grew at a strong pace recently. Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the third quarter of last year, and many forecasters estimate growth of about 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter. Those readings indicate that 2024 growth was just below the pace in 2023. That is notable, because many forecasters were anticipating a much more significant slowdown at this time last year.\nThat raises an important question: How has the economy maintained this pace of growth in recent years? For that, I look mainly to the supply side of the economy. Labor supply has been boosted by a rebound in labor force participation, especially for workers aged 25 to 54. Since February 2023, labor force participation for these workers equaled or exceeded its peak just before the pandemic of 83.1 percent and was 83.5 percent in November. Another contribution to labor supply came from the post-pandemic increase in immigration. Faster productivity growth also has supported economic growth. Labor productivity rose at an annual rate of 1.8 percent since the end of 2019, higher than the average 1.5 percent growth over the previous 12 years.\nAlthough the rapid growth in labor supply is unlikely to persist in coming years, I see several reasons to expect that productivity growth will remain strong.\n2\nThe U.S. experienced a surge in new business formation since the start of the pandemic. These newer firms are more likely to innovate and adopt new technologies and business processes, thus boosting productivity. Another factor likely to boost productivity growth is the high rate of investment among U.S. firms in artificial intelligence and other new technologies. Generative AI, in particular, may significantly increase the arrival rate of ideas, which should support productivity and growth.\nOn the demand side, American households' robust spending has driven the economy, and that has continued in recent months. Retail sales outside of gasoline stations rose 4.4 percent in November from a year earlier, an acceleration from the previous month's reading. While the unusually large savings balances built up during the pandemic have shrunk for many households, strong labor income growth continues to underpin consumer spending. That income growth is due both to solid job growth and to rising inflation-adjusted wages.\nInflation\nPrice increases have cooled notably over the past two and a half years, but, despite this significant progress on disinflation, there is still further to go before reaching our inflation target of 2 percent.\nAnnual inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has eased to 2.4 percent in November 2024, the latest available reading, from a peak of 7.2 percent in June 2022. When excluding often volatile food and energy costs, core PCE was down to 2.8 percent in November from 5.6 percent in September 2022.\nInflation readings can be volatile month to month, and the path of disinflation has been bumpy and may continue to be. Monthly readings earlier in the fall were slightly stronger than expected. However, November's monthly change was lower than expected and consistent with a 2 percent inflation trend.\nOver the past year, core goods prices decelerated, reflecting that supply and demand have come into better alignment. Meanwhile, the more modest wage growth I mentioned has contributed to downward pressure on services inflation, outside of housing. Rent growth and other measures of housing inflation remain elevated but stepped down in the November report. I expect more progress in reducing housing services inflation this year as the earlier slowing in growth of rents charged to new tenants feeds through into the growth of average rents. I continue to see inflation as gradually\u00e2\u0080\u0094if unevenly\u00e2\u0080\u0094returning over time to our goal of 2 percent in a sustainable manner.\nLabor Market\nTurning to the labor market, I see it as solid, though as having cooled over the past year. The U.S. labor market has come into better balance after a period of being very tight, with high turnover, during the initial recovery from the pandemic.\nThe unemployment rate was 4.2 percent in November. While the latest reading is still below historical averages, it has risen from the multidecade low of 3.4 percent in April 2023.\nNew applications for unemployment benefits and other measures of layoffs also remain low, but the rate of hiring has slowed to below the pace recorded in the years before the pandemic. The number of open jobs has essentially come back in line with the number of unemployed Americans seeking work. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has fallen to 1.1 from a peak of 2.0 in 2022. I will continue to monitor developments in the labor market closely, including continuing claims, which have risen in recent months.\nAfter a period of elevated job-switching early in the recovery, workers are voluntarily leaving their jobs at lower rates. And the gap between wage growth for job switchers and job stayers has largely gone away. Thus, I do not see the labor market as a source of significant inflationary pressure.\nMonetary Policy\nThinking of how the economy has evolved over the past year, at the start of 2024 the federal funds rate was at its highest level in more than two decades, providing notable restraint. Over the course of last year, inflation made gradual progress toward our objective, while the labor market gradually cooled. Thus, in September, I voted along with my FOMC colleagues to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate half a point after maintaining it at a peak of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for more than a year, and we subsequently approved two more quarter-point cuts in November and December.\nI continue to view the risks to achieving the two sides of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment as being roughly in balance. Over time, I still think it will likely be appropriate to move the policy rate toward a more neutral stance. However, the 100 basis points of rate cuts since September have notably reduced the restrictiveness of monetary policy. All along, I envisioned moving more quickly in the early stages of our easing campaign and then easing more gradually as the policy rate came closer to neutral. In addition, since September, the labor market has been somewhat more resilient, while inflation has been stickier than I assumed at that time. Thus, I think we can afford to proceed more cautiously with further cuts.\nPolicy is not on a preset course. The magnitude and timing of future changes to policy rates will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. My policy decisions will be guided by our dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment, and I know delivering on those goals will produce the best economic outcomes for all Americans.\nOverview of Financial Stability\nNow, I would like to move from a discussion of monetary policy to a description of the Board's work on financial stability. It is a core part of the Fed's mission, because a stable financial system provides financing and services to allow households, communities, and businesses to invest, grow, and participate in a well-functioning economy.\nTo begin that discussion, I will start by saying that I assess the financial system as being sound and resilient. I will share the evidence I believe supports this view and raise a few potential vulnerabilities that will require close monitoring.\nSince November 2018, the Fed has published the semiannual\nFinancial Stability Report,\nwhich provides assessments of key vulnerabilities, with an emphasis on four broad categories: household and business borrowing, financial-sector leverage, funding risks, and asset valuations.\n3\nIt also looks at some potential shocks. An important distinction exists between shocks and vulnerabilities. Shocks are adverse events, such as the pandemic, that by their nature are difficult to predict. Vulnerabilities\u00e2\u0080\u0094aspects of the financial system that would exacerbate stress\u00e2\u0080\u0094tend to build up over time and can be identified, assessed, and monitored. Policies to build resilience in the financial system are appropriately targeted at reducing vulnerabilities.\nI am sure many in the room have reviewed the most recent report released in November, but I will briefly summarize some key findings. Households and businesses appear to be in good shape and can service their debt, which is at manageable levels overall. In terms of financial-sector leverage, high levels of capital and liquidity in the banking system are a key source of resilience. Funding risks in the banking system have declined somewhat: Smaller banks have replaced some of their uninsured deposit funding with brokered and reciprocal deposits, which are less prone to runs but are still less stable than core bank deposits. Some nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs), including some large hedge funds, do have high leverage. NBFIs may also be exposed to liquidity stress that could be brought on by, among other things, bouts of market volatility. Valuations are elevated in a number of asset classes, including equity and corporate debt markets, where estimated risk premia are near the bottom of their historical distributions, suggesting that markets may be priced to perfection and, therefore, susceptible to large declines, which could result from bad economic news or a change in investor sentiment. Prices of some commercial properties have fallen substantially since 2022, particularly office buildings. I continue to be attentive to developments here.\nIdentifying Areas to Monitor\nI would like to use the remainder of my time today to talk about a few areas that I am paying close attention to, specifically private credit, stablecoins, cyber events, and AI. The rapid growth of novel products, business models, or technologies can lead to a buildup of familiar vulnerabilities by, for example, promoting excessive leverage or increasing interconnectedness. They can also bring novel shocks. But I want to stress that experience has also taught us that financial and technological innovations are hallmarks of a healthy financial system, and my remarks today should be viewed in that context.\nLet me start with private credit, which generally refers to direct loans made to businesses, mostly middle-market firms, by nonbank entities such as private debt funds and business development companies. Private credit has grown quite rapidly in the U.S., from around $500 billion in 2016 to more than $1.5 trillion at the end of 2023, making it comparable in size to both the high-yield bond and leveraged loan markets.\n4\nPrivate credit funds appear well positioned to hold the riskiest parts of corporate lending. These intermediaries generally use little leverage and are organized as closed-end funds, which means that investors\u00e2\u0080\u0094including pension funds, insurers, sovereign wealth funds, and certain retail investors\u00e2\u0080\u0094cannot redeem their fund shares, which limits the potential for runs.\nAt the same time, it is important to monitor and emphasize proper risk management of rapidly growing products or business models, especially those that have not been tested through a full credit cycle.\nFor instance, because of its role in credit creation, private credit has become a more macro-relevant sector that can transmit shocks through the real economy in the same way as shocks to other material sources of nonfinancial credit.\nWe also need to look at private credit in the context of the overall private finance ecosystem. Opacity and complexity can obscure buildups of operating leverage when borrowing by multiple entities in an intermediation chain is not apparent. Vulnerabilities due to this stacking of leverage may be exacerbated by interconnections within intermediation chains. Those could include overlapping management of private credit and private equity, private credit being provided to businesses sponsored by private equity, and unobserved provision of leverage to private credit funds by other financial intermediaries. Moreover, few private credit providers have experienced a complete credit cycle, which makes it difficult to predict how the industry might respond to a negative shock.\nI will now move to a discussion of stablecoins, which are digital assets that seek to maintain a stable value relative to a reference asset such as a national currency. They may also be accepted in different parts of the payment system. With assets under management of around $170 billion, stablecoins have a relatively small footprint in the U.S.\n5\nThey are not widely used as a cash-management vehicle or for transactions for real econ",

Kugler\nAt the Detroit Economic Club, Detroit, Michigan\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Jason, and thank you for the opportunity to speak here in Detroit today.\n1\nThis visit has allowed me to see the many encouraging signs in this region: growth here in downtown; the area's famously hard-working labor force; and the gritty Detroit Lions, with 11 wins this season and counting. The nation has taken notice. But, truly, one of my favorite parts of serving as a Governor on the Federal Reserve Board is visiting communities across the country and hearing directly from the families, workers, and businesses we serve.\nI am also glad to have the chance to speak with you near the end of the year. I think it is an appropriate time to look back and assess how the U.S. economy has developed over the course of 2024. I will also share with you my outlook and offer my views on U.S. monetary policy.\nI will start by saying that I view the economy as being in a good position after making significant progress in recent years toward our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The labor market remains solid, and inflation appears to be on a sustainable path to our 2 percent goal, even if there have been some bumps along the way, as I will discuss later.\nReaching this point for the economy was far from assured, especially if you reflect on the pandemic disruptions of nearly five years ago. Even the more recent performance of the economy, at least on the surface, has been surprising to many forecasters. Economic growth remained solid, while inflation moderated from its recent peak without the painful job losses that have often accompanied past efforts to counter high inflation.\nHeading into this year, that was not necessarily the forecast of many observers, who were expecting a notable deceleration of economic activity. For example, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators in December 2023 expected 1.3 percent GDP growth for all of 2024. More recent estimates show the economy is on track to grow at almost twice that rate this year.\n2\nSo how does one interpret these positive, if somewhat unexpected, results? For me, I turned to looking at not just the realities around me and listening to people around the country, but also to my background as an academic researcher who uses an evidence-based approach to recognize two very important developments that have shaped the economy this year: growth in the labor force stemming from an increase in immigration, and a surge in productivity. I have been closely monitoring these developments and discussing them for more than a year.\nAssessing the Economy Entering 2024\nEntering this year, I took notice of several peculiar puzzles that seemed to be playing out in the economy. In terms of overall growth, I noticed a significant divergence between two important measures of output: gross domestic product, or GDP, and gross domestic income, or GDI. While, over time, these two gauges should move together, they appeared to be out of sync heading into this year. The GDI data suggested rather anemic growth, averaging about 1 percent a quarter in 2023, contrary to very strong GDP readings of more than 2.5 percent. The two measures of output had contrasting implications for productivity growth.\nThere was a second puzzle in the labor market. Many forecasters expected that the labor market would remain somewhat tight this year, as rebalancing in the labor market had already attracted a large fraction of the available working-age population: The labor force participation of prime-age workers had reached levels not seen since the late 1990s. However, upon closer examination, I saw a more mixed picture.\nOn the one hand, payroll gains, while slowing, were still averaging a very robust pace of more than 200,000 jobs per month. Data from that time suggest that workers were easily able to find jobs, and measures of layoffs were low by historical standards. In fact, in certain industries, such as health care as well as leisure and hospitality, employment had not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. That raised questions about whether the supply of workers for those fields could keep pace with demand.\nBut, on the other hand, the unemployment rate was flat instead of declining. This was puzzling considering a robust pace of payroll gains and the assumption that labor supply was constrained. And the two most important labor market surveys sent somewhat divergent signals. The payroll survey of employers showed hiring was abnormally above the gain recorded by the survey of households. Was the economy expanding at a robust pace, as indicated by the payroll survey? Or was it slowing more, as suggested by the household survey?\nIn considering these questions, I interpreted the strong pace of payrolls from the establishment survey and the cooling of various measures of resource utilization as a signal that perhaps the official population estimates were understated to the downside. Starting at the end of 2023, I asked, what if substantial increases in the labor force due to the arrival of workers from other countries had not yet been picked up in Census estimates?\nWe had seen something similar before. In the late 1990s, official measures of the population were substantially revised up due to mismeasured immigration. During this period, establishment and household counts of workers also significantly diverged.\nAnd a third puzzle, with inflation, also warrants attention. Inflation had steadily progressed toward the FOMC's target during 2023, perhaps faster than some economists expected. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index eased from a peak of 7.2 percent in June 2022 to about 3 percent at the end of 2023, measured on a 12-month basis. When excluding volatile food and energy prices, core inflation similarly eased from a peak of 5.6 percent in February 2022 to 3 percent at the end of last year. Wage growth measures were consistent with inflation declining.\nEconomic Developments This Year\nAt the turn of the new year, new data and other economic developments appeared to cloud the picture further. An uptick in consumer spending and overall economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as a stretch of above-trend hiring gave a signal of unexpected strength to start the year. Adding to the puzzling figures, core inflation rose 0.5 percent in January, a notable acceleration from an average monthly increase of 0.15 percent in the previous quarter. Stronger-than-expected economic activity, faster hiring, and a reacceleration of prices gave some economists pause: Was this a temporary acceleration, or a more sustained reheating of the economy? I viewed it as likely temporary, as it turned out to be.\nMy view has always been that progress in the fight against inflation has to be judged from trends, not from a data release or two. I also anticipated that the process of bringing down inflation was likely to be sometimes bumpy. However, I viewed the elevated inflation readings as partly stemming from seasonal and one-off factors not fully accounted for in the data. In addition, price changes in some categories are difficult to measure, as I have described in previous speeches.\n3\nThat is particularly true for certain services categories for which direct sources of prices are not available; for example, the cost of living in an owner-occupied home or costs associated with certain financial transactions. And, as I have also discussed, the slow adjustment in workers' wages and relative prices may have contributed to bumps on the road to disinflation. Indeed, by the second quarter of the year, it became clear that the earlier firmer inflation figures were indeed temporary. Inflation stepped back down to average monthly increases of less than 0.2 percent. A factor in that was a cooling labor market, which I will discuss in a moment. With the labor market less tight, wage growth leveled off, and that in turn allowed prices for labor-intensive services to moderate.\nThere was another important development early this year: Estimates of population growth were revised substantially higher, according to a Congressional Budget Office report.\n4\nThe report showed about 6 million additional immigrants than were included in official estimates. Those workers added to the supply of labor, which had rebounded early in the pandemic recovery at a time when the unemployment rate was trending near half-century lows.\nThat information was consistent with my hypothesis that the strength in the economy was in part due to a larger-than-estimated labor force, or what economists call a positive supply shock. You may be more familiar with negative shocks, like the pandemic causing constrained supply chains. But the increase of workers was a positive shock and is notable because the underlying demographics of the U.S. heading into the pandemic were consistent with a slow-growing population and lower labor force participation, and that dynamic got worse as the pandemic generated excess retirements and a fall in immigration.\nIn terms of the labor market, I anticipated that after several months of strong job growth at the turn of the year, the labor market would cool significantly. And, indeed, by the middle of this year, the process of the labor market normalizing was taking shape. Payroll gains declined from an average pace of 260,000 in the first quarter to less than 200,000 in the second. Reports on the labor market included unusually large downward revisions to previous gains, and the unemployment rate moved higher, from 3.7 percent in January to 4.1 percent in June. At this point, other economists quickly shifted from worrying about a labor market that might be too hot early in the year to one that might be cooling too quickly. As a Fed policymaker, I had to consider if this movement was consistent with our mandate for maximum employment.\nEven with the easing in the labor market, consumer spending and overall economic activity continued to show solid growth. The combination of strong spending data and a cooling labor market was confounding. In thinking about this, I examined the productivity data that I follow closely and did not see the type of productivity growth I would have expected based on several other observations of the economy.\nFor example, new business formation had surged in the post-pandemic period. It has been shown that newer firms foster innovation and boost productivity growth. Business formation has remained elevated, from which I infer that the boost to productivity growth is not just a one-time phenomenon. Also, in the post-pandemic period, workers switched jobs at much higher rates than typical. This likely led to better matches where workers can find more productive uses of their skills. In some cases, immigrants filled job openings for which employers traditionally struggle to attract workers. Therefore, immigration can also contribute to improvements in job matches in specific but key sectors. As the economy reopened from the pandemic, many firms also invested in technology to substitute for workers, who were in short supply, which should support productivity gains. Emerging technologies, most notably artificial intelligence, may also be starting to contribute to enhanced productivity.\nTherefore, my speculation was that higher productivity was a possible explanation for the unusual combination of strong economic output, a cooling labor market, and declining inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094even if it was not apparent in the quarterly data.\nThat hunch was confirmed in September, when annual revisions to important economic data showed that economic activity and productivity growth had been stronger than previously estimated. The new figures indicated an average annual rate of productivity growth of 1.9 percent since 2020, notably higher than the approximate 1.4 percent annual rate in the five years before the pandemic. So that reveals our second positive shock: American workers have been more productive in recent years. This is a hugely important development because it increases the productive capacity of the economy and allows more rapid economic growth without overheating. What's more, revisions resulted in much better aligned GDP and GDI measures, and the two measures now also had much more aligned implications for productivity.\nIn summary, the surprising and largely desirable outcomes for the economy in 2024 are easier to understand once we solve the puzzles I discussed. My thorough assessment of a wide range of data sources revealed that an unusual combination of reports over the past year were gradually resolved once we understood the two positive supply shocks I discussed: growth in the labor force due to an increase in immigration, and higher productivity growth.\nEconomic Outlook\nThe data we have received in recent weeks have been consistent with the economic forces I described earlier. Real GDP increased at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter. The latest readings of retail sales have been strong. If household demand remains resilient, that would support growth in the fourth quarter and into next year.\nMonthly payroll gains have eased from earlier in the year, consistent with a gradual cooling of the labor market. It was difficult to draw a clear signal from the most recent jobs report, due to significant effects from hurricanes and labor strikes. I look forward to reviewing additional labor data on Friday. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent in October, is near the level I judge as roughly consistent with our maximum-employment mandate. After rising earlier this year, the rate has stabilized, though this was partly due to some withdrawals from the labor force. That bears watching moving forward.\nThe trend in immigration slowed in the second half of this year, and there is reason to expect immigration flows could further slow. I will closely monitor this data.\nInflation readings released last week show that overall PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in October, and core PCE prices increased 2.8 percent. I still view those readings, as of now, as consistent with inflation on a path to return to our 2 percent goal, and I am encouraged that inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored. But they also show the job is not yet done. Housing services inflation, in particular, remains elevated. And while global inputs to inflation have been mostly modest in recent months, it is difficult to predict future pressures.\nI have observed that the trade policy uncertainty index has risen in recent months, likely reflecting risks of changes in trade policy.\n5\nOf course, the incoming Administration and Congress have not enacted any policies yet, so it is too early to make judg",

Waller\nAt \"Building a Better Fed Framework,\" American Institute for Economic Research Monetary Conference, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Lydia, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I thought I might use my time with you to address the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) ongoing effort to return inflation to our 2 percent target while keeping the labor market and the economy strong.\n1\nAfter significant progress in reducing inflation and evident moderation in the labor market, in September the Committee judged that the time had come to begin easing monetary policy toward a more neutral setting to limit the risk of unduly weakening the labor market as progress continues toward 2 percent inflation. After reducing the policy rate 75 basis points since our September meeting, I believe that monetary policy is still restrictive and putting downward pressure on inflation without creating undesirable weakness in the labor market. I expect rate cuts to continue over the next year until we approach a more neutral setting of the policy rate.\nBut recent data have raised the possibility that progress on inflation may be stalling at a level meaningfully above 2 percent. This risk has raised concerns that the FOMC should consider holding the policy rate constant at our upcoming meeting to collect more information about the future path of inflation and the economy. Based on the economic data in hand today and forecasts that show that inflation will continue on its downward path to 2 percent over the medium term, at present I lean toward supporting a cut to the policy rate at our December meeting. But that decision will depend on whether data that we will receive before then surprises to the upside and alters my forecast for the path of inflation.\nLet me turn to the economic outlook. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a strong annual pace of 2.8 percent in the third quarter of 2024, and indications are that growth in the fourth quarter will be a bit slower. An average of private sectors forecasts predicts 2.2 percent, while based on fairly limited data so far, the Atlanta Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GDPNow model currently predicts 3.2 percent.\nOn the consumer side of the economy, real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 0.1 percent in October after a 0.5 percent rise in September. Given the recent volatility in these numbers, I won't read too much into the monthly swing. The modest increase in October might partially reflect some payback to the stronger growth in September. Overall, household balance sheets continue to be in generally good shape, and this position should help maintain spending going forward.\nOn the business side of the economy, the S&P Global U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) rose slightly in November but still stands at a level indicating a slight deterioration in overall business conditions among manufacturers for the fifth straight month. Today's Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey had a similar leaning. These readings are consistent with industrial production data for manufacturing remaining flat, as it has been for the past several months.\nBut these aggregate data mask quite different performances for interest-sensitive sectors and other businesses not so affected by rates. In the spring of 2022, when the FOMC began raising interest rates, production by more interest rate\u00e2\u0080\u0093sensitive manufacturers, such as business equipment, grew at about the same rate as production by less rate-sensitive manufacturers. But starting around the middle of 2023, when the policy rate hit its peak, those stories diverged, and production by interest-sensitive manufacturing declined, while other manufacturing rose, driving a sizable gap between the two types of industries. This divergence is an indication to me that, even after the Committee cut rates 75 basis points, restrictive policy is working the way it is intended to, affecting production in sectors where rates matter. It is also a reminder that there is still some distance to go in reducing the policy rate to neutral. As that occurs, I expect the gap between the two types of industries will narrow. As for the service sector, which is the larger share of business activity, the November S&P Global U.S. PMI continued to increase, extending the strong momentum for services over the past year or two.\nWhile the picture for economic activity is pretty clear right now across the major data that we look at, things aren't as clear in recent data on the labor market. As expected, the October employment report showed very little increase in the number of jobs, but likely because of the temporary effects of the recent hurricanes and the strike at Boeing, which also affected businesses serving Boeing and its workers. The strike is over, and it is likely that most of the job losses from the hurricane have reversed. So I do expect a rebound in payroll data in the November employment report that is due out later this week, but it may take more time for the full swings in the payroll data to fully wash out.\nFor that reason, I am leaning on other metrics to reveal what is really going on in the labor market. And when I look at a broader range of data, it tells a fairly consistent story over the past year about moderating demand relative to supply, consistent with continued progress toward 2 percent inflation and without an undesirable weakening in the labor market.\nThe unemployment rate started 2024 at 3.7 percent and climbed gradually, briefly hitting 4.3 percent before falling back down to 4.1 percent in September and October. While that is still quite low in historical terms, it indicates a labor market significantly looser than we saw from the middle of 2022 to the middle of 2023, when unemployment was close to 3.5 percent and fast wage growth contributed to high inflation. Other data sharpen this image of a looser but still-strong labor market. The share of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs, an indication of tightness in the labor market, has trended down to levels lower than before the pandemic. The number of job openings continues to gradually fall, another sign of moderating demand relative to supply, but the number of layoffs is still low, consistent with a healthy labor market.\nGrowth in wages and other forms of compensation has moderated at the same time that labor productivity has grown strongly. This story is very different than a couple of years ago when, for example, average hourly wages grew at an annual rate above 5 percent in 2022, at the same time that the productivity of workers was declining. This double whammy put significant upward pressure on inflation. But over the second and third quarters of 2024, average hourly wages have grown at less than a 4 percent annual rate, while productivity has grown around 2 percent. The math is pretty simple\u00e2\u0080\u00944 percent wage growth minus the 2 percent gain from higher productivity tells you that wage growth is consistent with bringing inflation down to 2 percent.\n2\nWhile I am pleased at how well the labor market has held up under restrictive monetary policy, I am less pleased about what the data have been telling us the past couple of months about inflation. After making a lot of progress over the past year and a half, the recent data indicate that progress may be stalling. Inflation based on the Commerce Department's measure of prices for PCE rose more than expected in September and October and so did \"core\" PCE inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices and is a better guide to future inflation. Three-month annualized core PCE inflation has risen over the past two months, while six-month annualized inflation has made only a small improvement. These rates now stand at 2.8 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively. These recent readings have contributed to 12-month core PCE inflation of 2.8 percent in October.\nIf we compare components of core inflation this October with last October, we see 12-month housing services inflation has softened and goods inflation has moved to slight deflation, but there has been an increase in nonmarket core services excluding housing. Overall, I feel like an MMA fighter who keeps getting inflation in a choke hold, waiting for it to tap out yet it keeps slipping out of my grasp at the last minute. But let me assure you that submission is inevitable\u00e2\u0080\u0094inflation isn't getting out of the octagon.\nWhile the recent increase and the level of inflation raise concerns that it may be getting stuck above the FOMC's 2 percent goal, let me emphasize that this is a risk but not a certainty. I take the recent inflation data seriously, but we saw a similar uptick in inflation a year ago that was followed by a continued decline, so I also don't want to overreact. And I expect housing services inflation to continue to moderate and I do not take much signal from the elevated inflation for other non-market services.\nNow let me turn to the implications for monetary policy based on my assessment of the underlying economic outlook. While some near-term aspects of the outlook may be a little unclear, something that is clear is the direction for monetary policy and our policy rate over the medium term, which is down. This downward trajectory reflects the fact that the level of aggregate demand in the economy, relative to supply, has moderated significantly over the past year\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is plainly visible in the data on spending and the labor market. Inflation over that time is also significantly lower, so it makes sense to be moving policy rates toward a more neutral setting.\nAnd there is a ways to go. In September, the median of the projections of FOMC participants was that the federal funds rate would be 3.4 percent at the end of next year, which is about 100 basis points lower than it is today. That number can and probably will change over time, but whatever the destination, there will be a variety of ways to get there, with the speed and timing of cuts determined by economic conditions we encounter on the way.\nThe motivation for continuing to cut the policy rate at the FOMC's next meeting begins with how restrictive the current setting is. After we cut by 75 basis points, I believe the evidence is strong that policy continues to be significantly restrictive and that cutting again will only mean that we aren't pressing on the brake pedal quite as hard. Although monthly core inflation has flattened out in recent months, there is no indication that the pace of price increases for key service categories such as housing and nonmarket services should remain at their current levels or increase. Another factor that supports a further rate cut is that the labor market appears to finally be in balance, and we should aim to keep it that way.\nConversely, based on what we know today, one could argue that there is a case for skipping a rate cut at the next meeting. Monthly readings on inflation have moved up noticeably recently, and we don't know whether this uptick in inflation will persist, or reverse, as we saw a year ago. Due to strikes and hurricanes, recent labor market data are giving us a cloudy view of the true state of the labor market that won't be clearer for a couple of months. As a result, one could advocate for not changing the policy rate at our upcoming meeting and adjusting our policy stance in a measured way going forward. In fact, if policymakers' estimates of the target range at the end of next year are close to correct, then the Committee will most likely be skipping rate cuts multiple times on the way to that destination.\nIn deciding which of these two approaches to take at the FOMC's next meeting, I will be watching additional data very closely. Tomorrow, we get the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. On Friday, we get the employment report, which, as I noted, may have misleading payroll data. Then next week, we get consumer and producer price indexes for November, which will allow a good estimate of PCE inflation for the month. Finally, on the first day of the FOMC meeting, we receive retail sales data for November that will give us an idea of how consumer spending is holding up.\nAll of that information will help me decide whether to cut or skip. As of today, I am leaning toward continuing the work we have started in returning monetary policy to a more neutral setting. Policy is still restrictive enough that an additional cut at our next meeting will not dramatically change the stance of monetary policy and allow ample scope to later slow the pace of rate cuts, if needed, to maintain progress toward our inflation target. That said, if the data we receive between today and the next meeting surprise in a way that suggests our forecasts of slowing inflation and a moderating but still-solid economy are wrong, then I will be supportive of holding the policy rate constant. I will be watching the incoming data closely over the next couple weeks to help me make my decision as to what path to take.\n1.

Bowman\nAt the 27th Annual Symposium on Building the Financial System of the 21st Century: An Agenda for Japan and the United States, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nDiscussions of artificial intelligence (AI) inevitably center on two main points: risks and benefits.\n1\nBoth of these can be frustratingly vague and amorphous. Proponents of AI project its widespread adoption will be as momentous as the industrial age\u00e2\u0080\u0094radically improving efficiency, increasing labor productivity, and changing the world economy. Skeptics largely focus on the risks, noting that it may introduce new and unpredictable variables into the economy and the financial system, including new forms of cyber-risk and fraud.\nIt would be impossible to predict what the future holds for AI, or how its use and impact will evolve over time. But as the technology continues to mature, as new use cases evolve, and it is rolled out more broadly, we will almost certainly be surprised by how it is ultimately used.\nLooking at the financial industry-specific implications of AI, it is helpful to consider not only how it may change the financial system, but also how regulatory frameworks should respond to this emerging technology. Are the existing frameworks sufficient? If not, how can regulators best balance the risks AI may pose to bank safety and soundness and financial stability with the need to allow for continued innovation?\nBroader availability of generative AI and large language models have created headlines and spiking stock prices, but the financial services sector has been using AI for some time.\n2\nOver time, it has become clear that AI's impact could be far-reaching, particularly as the technology becomes more efficient, new sources of data become available, and as AI technology becomes more affordable.\nDo We Need a Definition of AI?\nBefore discussing the implications of AI and regulatory policy approaches, we should ask whether we need a definition of AI. As it has advanced, the number and variety of definitions used to define AI have expanded.\n3\nSome definitions focus on the algorithms\u00e2\u0080\u0094like the use of machines to learn and reason in a way that simulates human intelligence. Others focus on the outputs\u00e2\u0080\u0094the ability to perform complex tasks normally done by humans. In 2021, an interagency request for information from federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve, sought comment on banks' use of AI, but notably avoided using any single definition. Instead, this request listed a few possible use cases, features, and forms. These included the use of structured and unstructured data; the use of alternative data sources; voice recognition and natural language processing; the algorithmic identification of patterns and correlations in training data to generate predictions or categorizations; and \"dynamic updating,\" where an algorithm has the capacity to update without human intervention.\n4\nWhile each definition of AI may serve its own purpose in the context of how it is used, any single narrow definition can be criticized. A more generic definition runs the risk of oversimplifying the range of activities, use cases, and underlying technology. A definition that captures the variability of AI technology in a more granular way runs the risk of being unwieldy in its length, and obsolete in the short-term as new forms and use cases emerge.\nWithin this definitional question\u00e2\u0080\u0094of whether and how you define AI\u00e2\u0080\u0094lies a more important policy question: Specifically, for what purpose is a definition required? In the context of the financial system, the definition of AI may help to delineate how the regulatory system addresses it and establishes the parameters for how it can be used by regulated institutions. Other specific contexts could also be included, like third-party service providers that support banks or other financial services providers, or use by regulators in support of their mandates.\nA definition helps regulators and regulated institutions understand the activities that are subject to rules and requirements by defining the scope. While this definitional question is important to establish clarity about the scope of what constitutes AI, it can also distract us from a more important point\u00e2\u0080\u0094what is the appropriate policy framework to address the introduction and ongoing use of AI in the financial system?\nI have no strong feelings about the ideal or optimal definition of AI, and some version of the many definitions floating around are probably adequate for our purposes. At a minimum though, a definition must establish clear parameters about what types of activities and tools are covered. But before leaving the topic, I want to offer a cautionary note. A broad definition of AI arguably captures a wider range of activity and has a longer \"lifespan\" before it becomes outmoded, and potentially never becomes outdated. But a broad definition also carries the risk of a broad\u00e2\u0080\u0094and undifferentiated\u00e2\u0080\u0094policy response. This vast variability in AI's uses defies a simple, granular definition, but also suggests that we cannot adopt a one-size-fits-all approach as we consider the future role of AI in the financial system.\nInnovation and Competitiveness\nKnowing that the technology and use of AI continues to evolve leads to the question of how it should be viewed by regulators, particularly in light of the need for innovation and the effect on competition.\nInnovation\nAI tools have the potential to substantially enhance the financial industry. In my view, the regulatory system should promote these improvements in a way that is consistent with applicable law and appropriate banking practices.\nOne of the most common current use cases is in reviewing and summarizing unstructured data. This can include enlisting AI to summarize a single report or to aggregate information from different sources on the same or related topics. The AI \"output\" in these cases may not directly produce any real-world action, but it provides information in a more usable way to assist a human. AI use cases like this may present opportunities to improve operational efficiency, without introducing substantial new risk into business processes. In some ways, the joining of AI outputs with a human acting as a \"filter\" or \"reality check\" can capture efficiency gains and control for some AI risks. Similarly, AI can act as a \"filter\" or \"reality check\" on analysis produced by humans, checking for potential errors or biases.\nAI tools may also be leveraged to fight fraud. One such use is in combatting check fraud, which has become more prevalent in the banking industry over the last several years. In a recent report, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network noted that from February to August of 2023, there were over 15,000 reports received related to check fraud, associated with more than $688 million in transactions (including both actual and attempted fraud).\n5\nThe growth in check fraud over the past several years has caused significant harm not only to banks and the perceived safety of the banking system but also to consumers who are the victims of fraudulent activity. The regulatory response to help address this growing problem has unfortunately been slow, lacking in coordination, and generally ineffective.\nCould AI tools offer a more effective way for banks to fight against this growing fraud trend? We already have some evidence that AI tools are powerful in fighting fraud. The U.S. Treasury Department recently announced that fraud detection tools, including machine learning AI, had resulted in fraud prevention and recovery totaling over $4 billion in fiscal year 2024, including $1 billion in recovery related to identification of Treasury check fraud.\n6\nWhile the nature of the fraud may be different in these cases, we should recognize that AI can be a strong anti-fraud tool and provide significant benefits for affected bank customers.\nIf our regulatory environment is not receptive to the use of AI in these circumstances customers are the ones who suffer. AI will not completely \"solve\" the problem of fraud\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly as fraudsters develop more sophisticated ways to exploit this technology. But it could be important if the regulatory framework provides reasonable parameters for its use.\nAnother often-discussed use case for AI in financial services is in expanding the availability of credit. AI is not the first technology with potential to expand access to credit for the \"un-\" or \"underbanked.\" We have long viewed alternative data as a potential opportunity for some consumers, like those with poor or no credit history but with sufficient cash flow to support loan repayment.\n7\nAI could be used to further expand this access, as financial entities mine more data sets and refine their understanding of creditworthiness. Of course, we also know that using AI in this context\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a way that has more direct impact on credit decisions affecting individual customers\u00e2\u0080\u0094also presents more substantial legal compliance challenges than other AI use cases.\nAI also has promise to improve public sector operations, including in regulatory agencies. As I have often noted, the data relied on to inform the Federal Open Market Committee decision-making process often is subject to revisions after-the-fact, requiring caution when relying on the data to inform monetary policy.\n8\nPerhaps the broader use of AI could act as a check on data reliability, particularly for uncertain or frequently revised economic data, improving the quality of the data that monetary policymakers rely on for decision-making. Additional data as a reliability check or expanded data resources informed by AI could improve the FOMC's monetary policymaking by validating and improving the data on which policymakers rely.\nWhile these use cases present only a subset of the possibilities for the financial system, they illustrate the breadth of potential benefits and risks of adopting an overly cautious approach that chills innovation in the banking system. Over-regulation of AI can itself present risks by preventing the realization of benefits of improved efficiency, lower operational costs, and better fraud prevention and customer service.\nEffect on Competition\nThe regulatory approach and framework can also promote competition in the development and use of AI tools in the financial system.\nAn overly conservative regulatory approach can skew the competitive landscape by pushing activities outside of the regulated banking system or preventing the use of AI altogether. Inertia often causes regulators to reflexively prefer known practices and existing technology over process change and innovation. The banking sector often suffers from this regulatory skepticism, which can ultimately harm the competitiveness of the U.S. banking sector.\nIn the United States, we often think about the financial system based on the regulatory \"perimeter.\" We view institutions within the scope of federal banking regulation (banks and their affiliates) as being \"in the perimeter,\" while entities that operate under other regulatory frameworks (including money transmitters licensed under state law) are \"outside the perimeter.\" Of course, the global financial system includes institutions that operate on a cross-border basis, and tools and approaches often permeate throughout the financial system once they have been deployed successfully in some other part of the system. But we know that the regulatory perimeter is permeable, and there is always the risk that activity pushed outside the perimeter can transmit risk back into the system even as the activities garner less scrutiny and regulation than banks. Put differently, the overly conservative approach may present only a fa\u00e7ade of safety, masking underlying risks to the financial system and those who rely on it.\nOf course, there are risks to being overly permissive in the AI regulatory approach. As with any rapidly evolving technology, supervision of its use should be nimble. Its users must make sufficient risk-management and compliance investments to conduct activities in a safe and sound manner, and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. While the banking system has generally been cautious and deliberate in its AI development and rollout, others have not. When left improperly managed and unmonitored, it can result in unintended outcomes and customer harm. For example, certain generative AI models have been known to generate nonsensical or inaccurate outputs, sometimes called \"hallucinations.\" In some cases, AI hallucinations have not involved significant harm, for example when discovered in a testing environment without customer-facing implications.\nThe Sufficiency of Existing Regulatory Tools\nWhile helpful to acknowledge the risks of over-regulation and under-regulation, we must understand our currently regulatory stance\u00e2\u0080\u0094what tools do we have to promote AI's benefits while helping to mitigate the risks? To address this topic, we should widen the lens to consider our approach to innovation broadly. Supporting innovation in the financial system can and should apply to the introduction and use of AI.\n9\nWhen we consider AI risks, many of these are already well-covered by existing frameworks. For example, AI often depends on external parties\u00e2\u0080\u0094cloud computing providers, licensed generative AI technologies, and core service providers\u00e2\u0080\u0094to operate. AI can also pose model risks in the banking context, with associated data management and governance concerns. AI can also impact a bank's cyber-resiliency as AI-related fraud tools become more widespread and more anti-fraud tools become available.\nWhile AI may be on the frontier of technology, it does not operate outside the existing legal and regulatory framework. AI is not exempt from current legal and regulatory requirements, nor is its use exempt from scrutiny. This is particularly true with AI; its use must comply with current laws and regulations, including fair lending, cyber security, data privacy, third-party risk management, and copyright. And when AI is deployed in a bank, an even broader set of requirements may apply depending on the use case.\nRegulators are often playing \"catch-up\" with banks at the forefront of innovation. As a result, they often suffer from significant disadvantages in terms of understanding how the technology works, understanding the uses of AI within financial institutions, and keeping up-to-date with the latest AI developments. Of course, further compounding this challenge is that much of the work in AI innovation occurs far outside the banking system, including in the development and testing of generative AI models and in compiling the data sources on which to train the models.\nDespite these challenges\u00e2\u0080\u0094and th",

Bowman\nAt the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches, West Palm Beach, Florida\nShare\nGood afternoon.\n1\nIt is a pleasure to join you for today's meeting of the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. It is truly humbling for me to be invited to speak to your membership, in the company of the many influential leaders, authors, and other public figures this organization has hosted since its founding in 1976.\nBefore turning to the main topic of my remarks today, I want to briefly share with you a bit about my background. I am one of the longest serving members currently on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), having served as a Board member since November 26, 2018. As a member of the Board, I am a permanent voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and serve in other capacities\u00e2\u0080\u0094I lead the Board committees on smaller and community banks and on consumer and community affairs and serve as a member on other committees that broadly address supervision and regulation and payments. I also provide input into the full range of matters that come before the Board.\nI am the first Governor appointed to fill the role created by Congress for someone with demonstrated primary experience working in or supervising community banks, banks with less than $10 billion in assets.\n2\nI have been both a banker, working in the community bank owned and operated by my family since 1882, and a bank supervisor\u00e2\u0080\u0094as the Kansas State Bank Commissioner. Early in my career, I spent almost a decade working in public service in several federal government roles, including setting up the Department of Homeland Security after 9/11 and as a Deputy Assistant Secretary and policy advisor to the first Homeland Security Secretary, Tom Ridge. I also served as a counsel on several U.S. House Committees, and as a staff member for the former U.S. Senator from Kansas, Bob Dole.\nThese experiences have provided me with a uniquely broad perspective about the role of government and the functioning of the U.S. economy\u00e2\u0080\u0094from the view of a regulated business, an executive branch agency, the legislative branch, and state and federal regulatory agencies.\nThroughout my career, but particularly in my current role as a member of the Board of Governors, I have approached my responsibilities in an independent way, relying on facts, analysis, my own experience and judgment, and the pursuit of the congressionally mandated goals that guide the work of the Board.\nIn some cases, this approach has led me to depart from the views of my colleagues. At its September meeting, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate, for the first time since we began tightening to combat inflation, by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. I dissented from that decision, preferring instead to lower the target range by 1/4 percentage point. In my statement published after the meeting, I agreed with the Committee's assessment that, given the progress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market, it was appropriate to reflect this progress by beginning the process of recalibrating the policy stance toward a more neutral setting. As my statement noted, I preferred a smaller initial cut in the policy rate. With inflation continuing to hover well above our 2 percent goal, I saw the risk that the Committee's large policy action might be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate. In addition, with the U.S. economy remaining strong, moving the policy rate down too quickly, in my view, would carry the risk of stoking demand unnecessarily and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures.\nMy dissent was notable in that the last dissenting vote from a Fed Board member on an FOMC vote occurred nearly 20 years ago. My dissent was guided by my view and interpretation of the available data and my understanding of the Fed's dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices, which I will discuss more in a moment.\nEveryone in this room knows that experience is important. My experiences have shaped and reinforced my views on how policymakers can best serve the public\u00e2\u0080\u0094narrowly, including in monetary policy decisionmaking and the regulation of the banking industry, but also more broadly in thinking about policymaking in support of an agency's mission balanced with its extensive impact on the affected industry and the U.S. economy.\nA Pragmatic Approach to Policymaking\nA Goal-Oriented Approach\nIn the past, I have discussed the role of policymaking from the perspective of a Federal Reserve Board member. But taking a step back, there are some broader themes relevant to agency policymaking more generally, themes that are useful beyond the context of the Federal Reserve. At a basic level, I think of this as a pragmatic approach. It requires tradeoffs to balance regulation while also not inhibiting economic growth.\nThe first question I like to ask when confronted with a policy issue is, \"Why are we here?\" You may recognize this question from Philosophy 101, but this question also applies to the exercise of executive authority by regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve has extensive responsibilities, and equally extensive powers, but it must exercise these powers only in furtherance of specific goals established by statute. The sheer scope of the Fed's powers can present a temptation to go beyond the statutory authority. For example, to play a more active role in the allocation of credit, or to displace other sources of bank funding even when market sources of liquidity are functioning well. It could also include the temptation to venture into policy matters unrelated to the Fed's responsibilities that are better addressed by Congress or other policymakers (here, a push for banking sector climate change related regulation comes to mind). The goals Congress has laid out for the Fed are complicated and important. Congress should not expect the Federal Reserve, or any other agency for that matter, to solve problems beyond that agency's limited purpose. Doing so would contravene the intent and authority of Congress.\nTo begin, I will provide a few concrete examples of how the starting point for policy is the agency's mission, including in: (1) the execution of monetary policy, and (2) the conduct of banking regulation and supervision.\nIn conducting monetary policy, Congress has given us the dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. Achieving these goals has often proven challenging, particularly over the last several years, as these policy objectives can sometimes be in tension. Policy actions to tame inflation, like raising the target range for the federal funds rate, can have an adverse effect on employment. A critical input to the FOMC decisionmaking process is an analysis of economic conditions and outlook. The real economy continues to be strong, with solid momentum in economic activity, robust household spending and business investment, and a healthy labor market that remains near full employment. Although economic conditions have been supportive of our employment mandate, they have been unsatisfying for our price stability mandate as inflation continues to be elevated.\nWe have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but progress seems to have stalled in recent months. The 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094which excludes food and energy prices\u00e2\u0080\u0094has moved sideways at around 2.7 percent since May, and the latest consumer and producer price index reports point to a similarly elevated or even higher reading for October. The persistently high core inflation largely reflects pressures on housing services prices, perhaps due to an increase in demand for affordable housing and an inelastic supply.\nGross domestic product (GDP) increased at a solid pace in the third quarter, maintaining the momentum from the previous four quarters. Growth continued to be driven by private domestic final purchases, as personal consumption, and retail sales in particular, strongly increased last quarter, more than offsetting further weakness in housing activity due to high mortgage rates. Retail sales continued to rise in October, even though Hurricanes Helene and Milton may have exerted a small drag on sales last month. The annual revision of the national income and product accounts confirmed that GDP has been providing the right signal about the ongoing strength in economic activity, as gross domestic income and personal income were revised up considerably for 2023 and the first half of this year.\nThe October employment report seems to have been affected by the recent hurricanes and the Boeing strike. It also featured the lowest response rate to the payroll survey in decades. After accounting for these special factors, it seems that payroll employment continued to increase in October at a pace close to the average monthly gain seen in the second and third quarters. The unemployment rate remained low at 4.1 percent in October, down from 4.3 percent in July. The labor force participation rate remains well below pre-pandemic levels and edged down further in October due to lower prime-age participation. While unemployment is notably higher than a year ago, it is still at a historically low level and below my and the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of full employment.\nThe labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has been close to the historically elevated pre-pandemic level in recent months. But there are still more available jobs than available workers, a condition that before 2018 has only occurred twice for a prolonged period since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength. Wage growth has slowed further in recent months, but it continues to indicate a tight labor market.\nThe rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs remain low. In addition to some cooling in labor demand, a mismatch between the skills of the new workers and available jobs could further raise unemployment, suggesting that higher unemployment has been partly driven by the stronger supply of workers.\nMonetary Policy\nIn the monetary policy function, we rely on the best data available, but without question the data are imperfect. We also consider a range of possible future economic conditions to help inform our monetary policy decisionmaking, which requires that we make assumptions and predictions about the future. Looking back over time, our crystal ball has never been perfect at predicting the risks that may emerge, how those risks may influence economic conditions, and how that should be considered in analyzing our monetary policy goals. To illustrate this point in terms of recent events, we have not yet met our inflation goal and, as I noted earlier, progress in lowering inflation appears to have stalled.\nI see greater risks to the price stability side of our mandate, especially while the labor market remains near full employment, but it is also possible that we could see a deterioration in labor market conditions. These predictions always come with a dose of humility, however, particularly because they rely on imperfect data. The labor market data have become increasingly difficult to interpret, as surveys and other measurements struggle to incorporate large numbers of new workers and to account for other influences that we do not yet fully understand and have not yet been able to accurately measure. As the dynamics of immigration and business creation and closures continue to change, it has become increasingly difficult to understand the payroll employment data. In light of the dissonance created by conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.\nWhile the mandate for monetary policy is straightforward, its execution is complex. Our decisions are guided by our dual mandate, but arriving at them entails careful analysis of sometimes flawed data, and informed judgments about unknowable future conditions.\nBank Regulation and Supervision\nIn conducting bank regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve promotes the safe and sound operation of individual banks, and the stability of the broader financial system. These bank regulatory goals have obvious synergies\u00e2\u0080\u0094individual banks operating in a safe and sound manner tends to create conditions that promote financial stability in the banking sector. The Fed's bank regulatory objectives include implicit tradeoffs: we aim to foster a banking system that is safe, sound, and efficient, while serving the U.S. economy, and facilitating economic growth. The objectives must also support the full breadth of the banking system from the very largest to the very smallest.\nStriking a balance among these competing goals can certainly be a challenge, and policy views on where that balance should be struck may vary. We should approach the task of bank regulation with an understanding and appreciation of these tradeoffs, coupled with an affirmative acknowledgment that the banking system is an important driver of business formation, economic expansion, and opportunity. A banking system that is safe and sound yet irrelevant would not fulfill our regulatory objectives, but would be the inevitable outcome of following a path that strives for elimination of risks rather than promotion of effective risk management. Banks are unique individual businesses, not public utilities.\nThe pursuit of these bank regulatory goals requires an approach that considers a range of regulatory and supervisory tools, from the quantitative\u00e2\u0080\u0094like the setting of bank capital and liquidity requirements\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the more subjective\u00e2\u0080\u0094like evaluating bank management during the examination process. And while the goals themselves seem straightforward, the tools available and the complexity and evolution of the financial system over time present real challenges from a policymaking perspective.\nWhen we consider drafting a new regulation, we should always ask \"What problem would this new regulation solve?\" Policymakers should exercise restraint in the promulgation of a new regulation, by articulating the problem it purports to solve and presenting an efficient way to address it. Identifying the problem that requires addressing often poses one of the most significant challenges. Ideally, the process would begin by identifying the problem, then move to an analysis of whether proposed so",

Cook\nAt the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia\nShare\nThank you, Christa. It is wonderful to be with you here on the University of Virginia's beautiful campus. This is my first visit here as an adult. As a child, I was fortunate enough to be able to attend the commencement ceremony of my aunt and uncle, who received their doctoral degrees from UVA several decades ago. My family and I are grateful to the University of Virginia for all the educational opportunities it has afforded us over the years. I look forward to connecting with many of the exceptional students and faculty during my visit.\n1\nAs a member of the Federal Reserve Board, I always find it a pleasure to hear from people in communities across the country and to share some views of my own. At the Fed, I am committed to pursuing the best policy to achieve the dual-mandate goals given to us by Congress of maximum employment and price stability. Today, I would like to share with you my outlook for the economy, including some international comparisons of productivity and inflation, and offer my views on U.S. monetary policy.\nBroadly, I view the economy as being in a good position. Inflation has substantially eased from its peak in mid-2022, though core inflation remains somewhat elevated. Unemployment remains historically low, but the labor market is no longer overheated. Economic growth has been robust this year, and I forecast the expansion will continue. Looking ahead, I remain confident that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent objective, even if the path is occasionally bumpy. Meanwhile, I see employment risks as weighted to the downside, but those risks appear to have diminished somewhat in recent months.\nInflation\nInflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has eased notably from a peak of 7.2 percent in June 2022. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data released last week indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in October. Core PCE prices\u00e2\u0080\u0094which exclude the volatile food and energy categories\u00e2\u0080\u0094increased 2.8 percent, down from a peak of 5.6 percent in February 2022.\nDespite this significant progress on disinflation, the elevated core figure suggests that we have further to go before credibly achieving our inflation target of 2 percent. Although most price indicators suggest that progress is ongoing, I anticipate bumps along the road. For instance, when measured on a monthly basis, estimated core PCE inflation stepped up in September and October after four months of lower readings. Even so, I still see headline and core inflation falling to 2.2 percent next year and to lower levels after that. Moreover, disinflation has been widespread across a broad range of goods and services. Taken together, recent data support my view that the disinflationary process is continuing.\nThinking of the components of inflation, core goods and core services inflation excluding housing are now at rates consistent with previous periods when inflation averaged about 2 percent. As a result, housing services account for most of the excess of core inflation over our target. Despite a slowing in rent increases for new tenants over the past two years, recent research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland suggests that existing rents for continuing tenants may still be notably below new tenant rent levels.\n2\nExisting rents rising toward market rent levels is keeping housing services inflation temporarily elevated. My view is that housing services inflation will come down gradually over the next two years as the earlier slowing of growth in new tenant rent feeds through into the overall rate.\nRecently, other inflation factors have been subdued. Core import prices have continued to step down from the surprisingly strong pace in the first half of the year. Global oil prices have fluctuated, largely in response to developments in the Middle East, but are back near the lows reached in late summer.\nMy confidence in continued disinflation is further reinforced by the moderation in wage growth. The employment cost index report showed that hourly compensation for private-sector workers rose at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the lowest since 2021. The 12-month change in average hourly earnings in October was 4 percent, down from 4.3 percent during the previous year. The wage premium for job switchers, a significant contributor to wage growth early in the pandemic recovery, has largely disappeared, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\nLabor Market\nTurning to the labor market, on balance, recent data suggest that it remains solid. Monthly increases in firms' payrolls have slowed from earlier this year but are consistent with only a gradual cooling in the labor market. The October employment report did show a sharp slowdown in job creation, but that was largely due to the temporary effects of recent hurricanes and a labor strike.\nWhile economists and forecasters often focus on aggregate data for the national economy, it is important to acknowledge that hurricanes Helene and Milton resulted in the tragic loss of life and devastating destruction in many parts of the country, including some here in the state of Virginia. My thoughts remain with those affected communities. The Federal Reserve System remains in touch with these communities to help the financial institutions that serve them in any way we can.\n3\nThe broader trend I see is that national job growth is solid but perhaps not quite strong enough to keep unemployment at the current low rate. Net hiring so far this year is running somewhat below estimates for what economists call the breakeven pace, or the rate of hiring needed to keep the unemployment rate constant, when accounting for changes to the size of the labor force. With job growth coming in below the breakeven pace, which was likely more than 200,000 jobs a month over the past year, the unemployment rate has risen from a historical low of 3.4 percent in April 2023 to 4.1 percent in October.\nOther data are also consistent with a gradual cooling in labor demand. The vacancies-to-unemployment ratio has fallen from a peak of 2.0 in 2022 to 1.1 in September, slightly below where it stood just before the pandemic. The rate at which workers are quitting their jobs continued to slide in recent months to well below its pre-pandemic level, which could indicate that workers are less optimistic about finding a better job should they leave their current role. Notably, firms' hiring rates and hiring plans remain subdued, while workers report reduced availability of jobs. Although layoffs remain low, less hiring makes it harder for labor market entrants and reentrants to find jobs. Also, our contacts report that employers are being more selective, waiting to find workers with the skills they seek, rather than pursuing a hire-and-train strategy.\nOverall, I see a labor market that has largely normalized after being overheated because of pandemic disruptions and dislocations. The labor market is in a good position\u00e2\u0080\u0094with the supply and demand for workers being roughly in balance\u00e2\u0080\u0094such that it is no longer a source of inflationary pressure in the economy. I will continue to watch incoming data carefully and remain attuned to signs of undesirable further cooling in the labor market.\nEconomic Output and Productivity Growth\nAlong with generally solid labor market data and moderating inflation, recent indicators show economic activity moving along at a strong pace. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter, consistent with the solid growth recorded in the first half of the year.\nAmerican consumers remain resilient, with broad-based gains in household spending on both goods and services. This supports broader economic growth because consumer spending constitutes roughly two-thirds of GDP. Spending at retailers and restaurants rose 2.8 percent in October from a year earlier, a faster 12-month rate of increase than the prior two months. Recent data revisions show that household income and savings have been higher than previously thought, improving the outlook for consumer spending and GDP growth.\nIt is remarkable that the U.S. economy has been growing rapidly even as inflation has been declining significantly over the past two years. One reason why this solid growth could be occurring is that potential growth, or the maximum rate at which an economy can grow without causing inflation over the medium term, may have increased.\nOne factor that appears to have supported both potential and actual growth is a faster pace of productivity gains. Recent data indicate labor productivity has grown at a 1.8 percent annual rate since the end of 2019, surpassing its 1.5 percent growth rate over the previous 12 years. Several forces could have boosted productivity in recent years. As I discussed in a recent speech in South Carolina, the U.S. experienced a surge in new business formation since the start of the pandemic.\n4\nThese newer firms are more likely to innovate and adopt new technologies and business processes, thus boosting productivity.\nTwo other factors boosting productivity relate in part to changes in the U.S. economy during and after the pandemic. Worker reallocation across jobs and locations surged early in the pandemic and remained high for some time. There is some research suggesting that such reallocation resulted in better and more productive matches between some workers and jobs, thus raising labor productivity.\n5\nAt the same time, severe labor shortages during the post-pandemic recovery spurred many businesses to invest in labor-saving technologies and to restructure aspects of production more efficiently, which may also have given at least a one-time boost to productivity.\nMore broadly, the continued sizable investment in new technologies may promote ongoing strength in productivity growth. Much of this investment has gone toward artificial intelligence (AI), which has the potential to transform many aspects of the economy and job market, as I discussed in speeches earlier this fall.\n6\n,\n7\nInternational Comparisons\nCompared with productivity abroad, recent U.S. productivity growth looks quite exceptional. As shown in\nfigure 1\n, before the pandemic, the U.S. had faster productivity growth\u00e2\u0080\u0094as shown by the green portion of the bars\u00e2\u0080\u0094than other advanced economies, but the difference was small. Since the pandemic, however, U.S. productivity growth has far exceeded that of Europe, Canada, and Australia, as shown in\nfigure 2\n. To explain this notable outperformance, some have highlighted our country's relatively flexible labor market and greater business dynamism compared with these other economies.\n8\nMoreover, to the extent that investment in technology has been a driver of cross-country differences, it is notable that private investment in AI has been much higher in the U.S. than abroad.\n9\nThis productivity outperformance is likely a main reason why U.S. GDP growth has been stronger than that of foreign economies; the path of inflation, however, has largely been similar across the globe. As shown in\nfigure 3\n, inflation in the U.S. and abroad rose sharply in 2021 and 2022, amid supply bottlenecks and a post-pandemic recovery in demand. Inflation reached a higher peak in European economies that were most directly affected by the energy price shock from Russia's war in Ukraine. Inflation has since declined globally as supply normalized and monetary policy tightening restrained demand. U.S. inflation, as shown by the black line, is nearly back to its 2 percent target level, while core inflation, as shown in\nfigure 4\n, has come down but remains somewhat above 2 percent.\nMonetary Policy\nAs I stated, the totality of the data suggests that a disinflationary trajectory is still in place and that the labor market is gradually cooling. As such, I view the risks to achieving the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability as being roughly in balance. Consistent with those balanced risks, in my view, it likely will be appropriate to move the policy rate toward a more neutral stance over time.\nMy colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I acted earlier this month to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point. That action came after we reduced the rate by 1/2 percentage point in September. Together, these moves were a strong step toward removing policy restriction.\nGoing forward, I still see the direction of the appropriate policy rate path to be downward, but the magnitude and timing of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. I do not view policy as being on a preset course, and I am ready to respond to a changing outlook. In fact, I find it helpful to consider a range of scenarios when thinking about the path of policy.\nIf the labor market and inflation continue to progress in line with my forecast, it could well be appropriate to lower the level of policy restriction over time until we near the neutral rate of interest, or the point when monetary policy is neither stimulating nor restricting economic growth. However, if inflation progress slows and the labor market remains solid, I could see a scenario where we pause along the downward path. Alternatively, should the labor market weaken in a substantial way, it could be appropriate to ease policy more quickly.\nMy policy decisions will be guided by our dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices, and I know delivering on those goals will produce the best economic outcomes for all Americans.\nThank you for having me here today. I look forward to your questions.\n1. The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nReturn to text\n2.

Powell\nAt Conversation with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Dallas, Texas\nShare\nWatch Live\nGood afternoon. Thank you to the World Affairs Council, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and the Dallas Regional Chamber for the kind invitation to be with you today. I will start with some brief comments on the economy and monetary policy.\nLooking back, the U.S. economy has weathered a global pandemic and its aftermath and is now back to a good place. The economy has made significant progress toward our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The labor market remains in solid condition. Inflation has eased substantially from its peak, and we believe it is on a sustainable path to our 2 percent goal. We are committed to maintaining our economy's strength by returning inflation to our goal while supporting maximum employment.\nRecent Economic Data\nEconomic growth\nThe recent performance of our economy has been remarkably good, by far the best of any major economy in the world. Economic output grew by more than 3 percent last year and is expanding at a stout 2.5 percent rate so far this year. Growth in consumer spending has remained strong, supported by increases in disposable income and solid household balance sheets. Business investment in equipment and intangibles has accelerated over the past year. In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been weak.\nImproving supply conditions have supported this strong performance of the economy. The labor force has expanded rapidly, and productivity has grown faster over the past five years than its pace in the two decades before the pandemic, increasing the productive capacity of the economy and allowing rapid economic growth without overheating.\nThe labor market\nThe labor market remains in solid condition, having cooled off from the significantly overheated conditions of a couple of years ago, and is now by many metrics back to more normal levels that are consistent with our employment mandate. The number of job openings is now just slightly above the number of unemployed Americans seeking work. The rate at which workers quit their jobs is below the pre-pandemic pace, after touching historic highs two years ago. Wages are still increasing, but at a more sustainable pace. Hiring has slowed from earlier in the year. The most recent jobs report for October reflected significant effects from hurricanes and labor strikes, making it difficult to get a clear signal. Finally, at 4.1 percent, the unemployment rate is notably higher than a year ago but has flattened out in recent months and remains historically low.\nInflation\nThe labor market has cooled to the point where it is no longer a source of significant inflationary pressures. This cooling and the substantial improvement in broader supply conditions have brought inflation down significantly over the past two years from its mid-2022 peak above 7 percent. Progress on inflation has been broad based. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data released this week indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in October and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. Core measures of goods and services inflation, excluding housing, fell rapidly over the past two years and have returned to rates closer to those consistent with our goals. We expect that these rates will continue to fluctuate in their recent ranges. We are watching carefully to be sure that they do, however, just as we are closely tracking the gradual decline in housing services inflation, which has yet to fully normalize. Inflation is running much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal, but it is not there yet. We are committed to finishing the job. With labor market conditions in rough balance and inflation expectations well anchored, I expect inflation to continue to come down toward our 2 percent objective, albeit on a sometimes-bumpy path.\nMonetary Policy\nGiven progress toward our inflation goal and the cooling of labor market conditions, last week my Federal Open Market Committee colleagues and I took another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate 1/4 percentage point.\nWe are confident that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the economy and the labor market can be maintained, with inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent. We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks to both sides. We know that reducing policy restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.\nWe are moving policy over time to a more neutral setting. But the path for getting there is not preset. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, we will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates. The strength we are currently seeing in the economy gives us the ability to approach our decisions carefully. Ultimately, the path of the policy rate will depend on how the incoming data and the economic outlook evolve.\nWe remain resolute in our commitment to the dual mandate given to us by Congress: maximum employment and price stability. Our aim has been to return inflation to our objective without the kind of painful rise in unemployment that has often accompanied past efforts to bring down high inflation. That would be a highly desirable result for the communities, families, and businesses we serve. While the task is not complete, we have made a good deal of progress toward that outcome.\nThank you, and I look forward to our discussion.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            November 14, 2024",

Kugler\nAt the Albert Hirschman Lecture, 2024 Annual Meeting of the Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association and the Latin American and Caribbean Chapter of the Econometric Society, Montevideo, Uruguay\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for your generous introduction, Marcela, and thank you for the opportunity to be here and speak to you today.\n1\nI believe I am the first central banker from the U.S. to address this annual meeting, but I know, and am proud to say, that I am the first who is also Latin American. And, of course, I have been part of the LACEA Executive Committee and I have presented papers at many LACEA conferences over the years, so it is a pleasure to be back here among many colleagues.\nWhen the United States suffered very high inflation beginning in 2021, it was a new and unfamiliar experience for many too young to recall the last time this occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. Of course, very high inflation is not such a distant memory for people from Latin America and the Caribbean, and that includes me. Growing up in Colombia, I vividly recall the daily challenges of trying to plan and live with sustained double-digit inflation, and I especially remember the pain it imposed on disadvantaged people.\nGaining control over inflation requires a commitment by society to accept the tradeoffs and sacrifices often needed, and it also requires deliberate and principled decision making by central banks.\n2\nCentral bankers must both formulate their best judgment of the correct policies that will achieve a desired level of inflation and follow through by executing and maintaining those policies. It has been widely recognized\u00e2\u0080\u0094and is a finding of economic research\u00e2\u0080\u0094that central bank independence is fundamental to achieving good policy and good economic outcomes. It is not sufficient by itself to achieve those goals, but, over time, it is almost always necessary.\nLet me start by defining terms. An independent central bank is one that can carry out monetary policy insulated from pressures arising from other parts of government or elsewhere. When there is central bank independence, the role of national or jurisdictional governments is typically one of representing the public in specifying a mandate for the central bank and holding the central bank accountable by monitoring its performance and appointing central bank leadership. In this arrangement, the public, through representative government, specifies the overall objectives that central banks should pursue.\nSome noteworthy examples of central bank mandates include the dual mandate established by the U.S. Congress that requires the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to promote maximum employment and price stability. The European Central Bank's primary mandate of price stability is spelled out in a treaty enacted by the legislatures of its constituent member states. The central bank of Brazil pursues price stability as its primary objective as well. In the United Kingdom, its parliament has mandated that the Bank of England pursue monetary and financial stability.\n3\nSimilarly, the objectives of the central banks of Chile and Uruguay are both to keep inflation low and stable and to foster the stability and efficiency of the financial system.\nBefore we discuss why monetary policy independence can benefit the economy, let me take a step back and discuss the tradeoffs associated with the conduct of monetary policy. Central banks significantly influence prices, interest rates, employment, and income in the economy, so it is natural that sometimes there would be differing views on their decisions. For instance, monetary policy actions that promote economic activity and employment growth can put upward pressure on inflation. Conversely, policies to lower inflation tend to slow economic activity and employment growth. This tradeoff typically means that returning inflation to a specific target level when inflation has been allowed to run high may require more restrictive policy and a reduction in demand and higher unemployment. As I pointed out in a speech last spring at Stanford University, however, we have seen this tradeoff dissipate over the past couple of years, pointing to the possibility that we have been now for some time on the steep part of the Phillips curve, where inflation can come down substantially without a big increase in unemployment. Yet there is a possibility that this tradeoff may become more prominent as we move toward the flatter part of the Phillips curve.\nThe economic literature points out that striking a balance in these tradeoffs can be difficult for an elected or otherwise representative government for various reasons. One reason highlighted in the literature is that an elected government may be naturally focused on the short-term goals of its constituents and may have an incentive to try to lower the unemployment rate in the short run, with less concern about the longer-term effects on inflation and growth. The literature has labeled this fundamental problem \"time inconsistency.\"\n4\nThis incentive may generate undesirable economic cycles, potentially destabilizing prices. And if the public learns over time that the central bank is responsive to these incentives to increase inflation to boost employment temporarily, expectations of future inflation would rise, a symptom of a loss of credibility of the monetary policy authority. Governments also may have an incentive to increase inflation to monetize their debts, which become effectively smaller as the purchasing power of money declines. Also, if elected officials are responsible for monetary policy decisions, the typical alternation in control of government between different parties may lead to different preferences in the tradeoff between employment and inflation, destabilizing prices and the economy in the long term.\n5\nIn summary, economic research argues that demands on government to address concerns in the short term may result in excessively discretionary monetary policy and do not provide the best incentives for effective monetary policy that promotes the long-term health of the economy.\nA solution devised by governments and explored in economic research is to delegate monetary policy to an independent entity: the central bank.\n6\nBy establishing policy mandates in laws or treaties, the government voluntarily constrains itself from suddenly altering policy, and thus it also discourages public pressure to do so. As in Homer's\nOdyssey,\nin which Odysseus asks his crew to tie him to the mast of his ship to avoid being bewitched by the Sirens' songs, policy mandates help central banks avoid being swayed by short-term desires to the detriment of longer-term goals.\nNow that we have discussed the reasons for delegating the authority to conduct monetary policy to an independent entity, we are left with the task of describing how such independence should be designed and implemented in practice. There are two broad categories of central bank independence. The first of these is goal independence\u00e2\u0080\u0094to what extent is the central bank free to define its goals? The research literature makes a distinction between instrument independence\u00e2\u0080\u0094the prerogative to make monetary policy decisions, which I will discuss more later\u00e2\u0080\u0094and goal independence.\n7\nIn particular, the Federal Reserve's goals are defined by law, so it is not goal independent. Nevertheless, in spelling out those goals, the law provides the Federal Reserve with some degree of independence in defining them in detail.\nFirst, let's talk about the extent to which the law has defined the Federal Reserve's monetary policy goals. Unlike some other central banks that target inflation, the FOMC has been handed two coequal goals\u00e2\u0080\u0094maximum employment and price stability. The Committee is not free to pursue one or the other\u00e2\u0080\u0094it must pursue both. And these two sides of the mandate are pretty clear. Maximum employment means, in effect, the lowest unemployment rate that is consistent with stable prices. The law does not spell out a level of inflation that fulfills the goal of stable prices, but it has traditionally been viewed as a low and stable inflation rate.\nMandates limit goal independence, but the form of those mandates can allow some role for the central bank in setting out its goals. The 1977 law defined the Federal Reserve's dual mandate, allowing the FOMC to work out the details. In 2012, the FOMC defined price stability as a longer-run annual inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by the Commerce Department's estimate of the rate of increase in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator. Because maximum employment is unobserved and likely changes over time, it can be estimated only with considerable uncertainty; thus, the Committee chose not to define it in numerical terms. But Committee participants estimate a related number, the longer-run rate of unemployment, which is published every three months in the Summary of Economic Projections.\nAnother aspect of independence is instrument independence, which affords central banks flexibility in how to use the tools of monetary policy, such as policy interest rates, to achieve their goals. In the case of the FOMC, instrument independence has allowed it to adopt new ways to achieve its goals, as the financial system has evolved over the decades. This has been particularly important when the economy faced unprecedented challenges, as it did during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and during the 2020 pandemic. Because of this flexibility, the Federal Reserve Board and the FOMC were able to respond promptly and, as it turned out, very effectively.\nAcross countries and jurisdictions, goal independence and instrument independence have different dimensions and many variations. In some countries, including India, Brazil, and South Korea, the targets for inflation rates are jointly decided by the central bank and the ministry of finance. In contrast, the central banks of Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, among others, are given authority to choose their own inflation objectives.\nTo understand how governments have come to embrace the independence of central banks, it is helpful to review how they have evolved from their origins in the 17th century. Sweden's Riksbank was established by the private sector in 1688 to lend the government funds, and the Bank of England followed in 1694, with a similar structure and purpose.\n8\nOther European central banks followed in the 19th century and a wave of many more in the 20th, including the Federal Reserve. At different times, these central banks made the transition from wholly private to wholly public institutions and became accountable to government, and by the mid-20th century, there was a growing recognition that independence made for a more practical and, ultimately, more effective central bank. In the United States, the moment of truth came in 1951. During World War II, the Federal Reserve had agreed to peg interest rates on Treasury securities in order to ensure smooth funding of the war effort, and after the war, it continued to peg the longer-term Treasury rate. In the early 1950s, inflation soared, but Treasury favored continuing a cap on longer-term interest rates so that debt management costs could continue to be low during the Korean War. After a series of high-level meetings, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury reached an agreement in 1951 that freed the Fed from the obligation to fix interest rates and allowed it to use monetary policy independently to pursue national economic goals.\nResearchers have analyzed the historical experiences of particular central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, to understand the transition toward central bank independence and how it affects economic performance.\n9\nIn addition, researchers have also developed large cross-country indexes measuring the level of central bank independence while capturing multifaceted aspects of this independence based on banks' legal statutes over long periods.\n10\nThe empirical regularity that stands out in many different studies analyzing these indexes is the rise in central bank independence starting in the 1980s, with studies analyzing at least 120 countries.\n11\nEconomic research has cited several factors driving this adoption of central bank independence. In the 1980s and 1990s, emerging economies saw central bank independence as a way to facilitate access to global trade and financial markets, which were liberalized during that time.\n12\nAnother important factor was the experience of developing country debt crises during this period, which led to demands by creditor banks and international lenders for central bank independence.\n13\nTo whatever extent these other factors pushed governments toward central bank independence, a consensus developed that such an arrangement yielded better economic outcomes. Based on measures of central bank independence, researchers indeed have found a relationship between independence and lower inflation, especially for advanced economies.\n14\nWhile evidence of a negative relationship between independence and inflation has been a bit more elusive in the case of emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), the economic literature does find a relationship between independence and lower inflation volatility in these countries.\n15\nAmong the reasons I would cite for why it is more difficult to find a relationship between independence and lower inflation in EMDEs is that legal measures of central bank independence, also called \"de jure independence,\" may not reflect the relationship between the central bank and the government that exists in practice\u00e2\u0080\u0094referred to as \"de facto independence.\" In countries where the rule of law is not as strongly embedded in their institutions, there can be wide gaps between the formal, legal institutional arrangements and their practical effect.\n16\nIndeed, alternative measures of independence, such as turnover of central bank governors, point to de facto measures being negatively associated with inflation, especially in emerging economies.\n17\nAnother possible reason is that emerging economies may be more exposed to volatile shocks and governmental regime changes, leading to greater turnover in central bank leadership and clouding the relationship between central bank independence and inflation.\n18\nThe relationship between central bank independence and lower inflation and inflation volatility is therefore clear. But the connection to faster growth in economic activity is not. On the one hand, the primary reason for central bank independence in most countries with a single mandate is to provide price stability, so the lack of association between ",

Waller\nAt The Clearing House Annual Conference 2024, New York, New York\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for inviting me to speak here today.\n1\nThe Clearing House is a great place to talk about the evolution of clearing and settlement of payments in the United States. The key question I want to address today is, what roles should the private sector and the Federal Reserve play in payments?\nAs a strong believer in the benefits of a capitalist system, I hold the view that it is generally the private sector that can most reliably and efficiently provide goods and services to the economy. And I apply this view to the payments ecosystem.\nIt is that perspective that underlies a question I often ask when forming my positions on the appropriate role the Federal Reserve should play in a wide variety of initiatives: What is the fundamental market inefficiency that would be solved by government intervention and can only be solved by government intervention? If there isn't a satisfactory answer, then I believe government shouldn't intervene in private markets. Does this mean I believe the Federal Reserve should not be involved in payments? No. While I generally believe that government shouldn't directly compete with the private sector, there are situations where government involvement is needed to solve for market inefficiencies that may arise because of things like incomplete markets, coordination problems, or a lack of resilience.\nAs a policymaker, I have applied that same question to issues ranging from bank regulation to monetary policy. For an example in the payments area, three years ago there was an increase in public discussion about creating a new payment instrument called a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Federal Reserve Board was compiling a report and seeking public comment on the potential benefits and risks of the idea. In a speech I gave in August 2021, I asked, what problem would a CBDC solve? In other words, what market failure or inefficiency demands this specific intervention?\n2\nIn more than three years, I have yet to hear a satisfactory answer as applied to CBDC.\nGiven today's audience and my position serving as the chair of the Board's payments committees, I want to focus on the important roles the private sector and the Federal Reserve play in our ever-evolving payment system. To set the stage for that discussion, I think it is helpful to recap some history around payments and clearing in the United States.\n3\nIn the early decades following the country's founding, banks generally had state charters. While state banknotes and checks circulated locally as payment instruments, there were difficulties clearing and settling checks across states. One way of describing this is to say that the early U.S. payment system suffered from incomplete markets. The Second Bank of the United States was created in 1816 and, due to its federal charter, it was able to create a national system for clearing checks and banknotes. This in turn led to a more complete national clearing and settlement process.\nWhen the charter for the Second Bank lapsed, clearing and settlement of banknotes and checks fell back to state-chartered banks. Many of the earlier inefficiencies resurfaced. For example, porters in New York City would deliver checks and exchange them for gold or other coins and then transport that \"specie\" to the payee. Hauling these money bags around New York posed obvious risks, and these risks multiplied by the mid-19th century when the number of banks in New York grew rapidly. As this audience is well aware, the New York Clearing House Association (NYCH) was founded in 1853 and served as a central location for the clearing process, which soon evolved, with certificates replacing coins. Furthermore, by being part of a common infrastructure, all members had a reasonably good idea of the quality of each other's balance sheets. In modern economic language, the NYCH became a coordination mechanism that improved clearing by getting banks to clear and settle payments in a well-organized manner. It also reduced asymmetric information about the quality of member balance sheets. By performing this function for New York banks, which constituted a relatively large share of the U.S. financial system, the clearing and settling of payments improved nationally. In this sense, the NYCH was the closest thing the United States had at that time to a central bank.\n4\nWhile this was an improvement, not all important financial intermediaries were members of the NYCH or other such private arrangements. That is, there were gaps. And financial panics, sometimes driven by gaps and problems in check clearing, were a regular feature of the latter 19th and early 20th century.\nThe Panic of 1907 was a classic example of that. Depositors and investors lost confidence in certain New York banks that had been combined into large, complex, and opaque trust companies that were not members of the NYCH. This resulted in runs on those trusts, which led to broader liquidity problems. Although the NYCH had the ability to provide liquidity to those trusts, the provision of that liquidity was delayed. It appears that at the time, the NYCH was, reasonably, observing some form of Bagehot's dictum when deciding whether to provide liquidity. Under that dictum, you want to know that the institution to which you're providing liquidity is solvent. If it isn't, then the liquidity extension could be akin to throwing good money after bad. But because the trust companies at the time weren't member institutions, the clearinghouse didn't have a good enough understanding of their balance sheets to know whether they were solvent.\n5\nSome banks refused to clear checks from other institutions, which led to an erosion of depositor confidence and more failures. This historical example points to another aspect of a payment system that is important\u00e2\u0080\u0094resilience of the system.\nThese problems highlighted by the 1907 panic\u00e2\u0080\u0094coordination failures and a lack of resilience\u00e2\u0080\u0094could have been mitigated with the help of a central bank. Paul Warburg, an influential banker at the time, argued that such a central bank could \"establish and maintain a perfect system of credit, enabling the general banks to transform cash credits into actual cash with such absolute ease and certainty that the use of cash credit, instead of actual cash, will not cease, no matter what may happen.\"\n6\nIn 1913, Congress agreed and created the Federal Reserve. It positioned the Federal Reserve at the center of the banking system by establishing a nationwide check-clearing system and a telegraph wire transfer service that is now known as Fedwire\u00ae. The Fed was also intended to function as a lender of last resort so that suspension of payments would no longer be necessary. In the 1970s, the Fed promoted more efficient check-clearing by adding the automated clearinghouse service. Our job in providing these services and carrying out our responsibilities was and continues to be to make sure the payment system functions efficiently and resiliently, promoting the kind of confidence that is vital for a modern economy.\nThe lesson from this history, as relevant now as ever, is that the payment system has been one of those areas in which the best efforts of the private sector have sometimes fallen short. The decentralized and diverse nature of banks in the United States is a feature that goes back to the 1800s and has the merits of promoting competition and a vibrant economy. However, when engaging in clearing and settling payments, coordination problems and information asymmetries across banks can be, and were, destabilizing. While the private sector made advances in resolving those issues, the Panic of 1907 showed that those steps were not sufficient. As successful as the NYCH was for its members, it could not protect its members and the economy from risks in the growing share of finance occurring outside its walls. This contributed to the motivation to establish the Federal Reserve and its role in payments.\nFast forward to today, and we are once again in an era of rapid change and innovation in money and payments. Some of this will not pan out. Some of this change is about delivering services already available but doing so with new technologies. And some of it is leveraging new technology to rethink existing payment, clearing, and settlement structures. How will all of this come together? And what will be the respective roles of the private sector and the Federal Reserve? Let's break it down, keeping in mind my principle that the Federal Reserve should focus on addressing issues that the private sector cannot address alone and, in doing so, promote an efficient and resilient U.S. payment system.\nI'll start by discussing the important roles that the private sector now plays in the payment system and in the evolution of payments under way. The private sector connects consumers and businesses to the payment system, with financial institutions competing to provide services to their customers. Such competition can lead to better products and services for consumers as profit-seeking competitors look for opportunities to win over customers including through the adoption of new technologies. I have noted my concern that some see these new technologies as an opportunity for the public sector to play a\nbigger\nrole in payments, which may crowd out private investment. I believe this would be a policy mistake and a better approach is one in which the private sector continues to have a significant footprint, with the role of government limited.\nOne important reason for that is that the private sector, through competition, is typically best situated to sort out good ideas from bad ideas, rather than central banks or other public-sector institutions choosing winners and losers. At the early stages of innovation, the true value-added of the application of new technologies is murky. Market competition helps sort that out and typically leads to a wider range of products that can be better suited to the needs of consumers.\nBut just as was the case in the time of Warburg, there remain problems in payments that can't be fully resolved by the private sector. And just as we have done throughout history, the Federal Reserve stands ready to support the evolution in payments and do so primarily through our operational role in the payment system, by providing core clearing and settlement infrastructure on which the private sector can innovate. Notably, the Fed has the unique ability to provide the infrastructure to reliably settle interbank obligations using balances at the central bank, which enhances the stability of the banking system and the broader economy, reflecting the lessons learned in 1907 and through earlier banking panics.\nCompared with many other countries where a small number of large banks dominate, the United States has thousands of banks and credit unions. Connecting those many organizations to a payment network requires a significant amount of coordination. One recent example of an area in which we're playing such a coordination role is in instant payments. The role we're playing with FedNow is to help with that coordination problem using our existing connections to those thousands of institutions. And that approach is consistent with my overall view of the appropriate role of government\u00e2\u0080\u0094to narrowly address problems like those of coordination that can't always be efficiently solved by the private sector alone. In doing so, we complement the private sector and promote responsible and efficient innovation in the broader market.\nWith respect to new and emerging technologies in finance, I can think of two ways in which the private sector is uniquely positioned to develop and deploy them while the government is not well suited to do so. First is the question of innovation risk\u00e2\u0080\u0094the investment in new payment technologies is large and comes with risk of failure. Private-sector entities, risking their own funds and seeking to turn a profit, will have a greater incentive to accurately gauge demand for these technologies and bring those products to market faster. Second, despite the current fascination around the world with industrial policy, rarely can the government match the ability of the private sector to efficiently allocate resources and explore how well new technologies can address actual shortcomings in the current payment system. It is too early to tell whether some of the new technologies will relieve significant frictions in the payment system, but it is going to be the private sector, betting with its own money, that is best positioned to explore this question.\nIf problems emerge, as they did with check clearing in the 19th century, then government can play a constructive role in overcoming them. Well before this point, however, it makes sense for the public and private sectors to look down the road together and engage in dialogue about potential issues and opportunities that might arise. For example, through the Bank for International Settlements, the Fed is engaged with the private sector to explore how tokenization technology might be used to facilitate cross-border payments in a faster and cheaper manner. This project brings together multiple central banks and private-sector financial firms in collaboration to potentially facilitate a better-functioning monetary system.\n7\nThat process of working together to promote the efficiency and safety of the payment system, as the Federal Reserve has done for decades, can lead to outcomes that benefit households, businesses, and the overall economy.\nAmerican entrepreneurship and technical prowess have generated exciting innovations in payments, and they will continue to do so. The role of the Federal Reserve is to support that initiative and engage with the private sector to promote innovation while guarding against risks to financial stability. We've managed this balancing act before and will continue to do so. And, together, we will ensure that the payments ecosystem continues to move forward for the benefit of households and businesses.\n1.

While I am disappointed not to be able to join you in person this morning, I am pleased to be among the more than 1,000 participants joining today's discussion online. The agenda today promises to be just as informative and thought-provoking as yesterday's session.\nGiven that this conference provides an opportunity to engage in discussions about fintech and its importance in the financial services industry, I'd like to reiterate something I have highlighted a number of times in the past. Regulators have an obligation to understand the functionality of new innovations, including the benefits that innovation can bring and the accompanying risks.\n2\nConferences like this enable us to expand our knowledge and understanding of these benefits and risks by bringing together experts throughout the financial system to discuss important developments and emerging issues related to financial technology. These discussions help to inform our work throughout the Federal Reserve System.\nOften the pace of technological change can be rapid. New or improving technologies have the potential to make our banking system faster and more efficient. They can result in both lowering the cost of and expanding the availability of products and services for consumers. But they can also carry risks.\nTo be effective in the face of this ongoing evolution, regulators must be aware of the potential risks and how existing technology could be leveraged for new services. Therefore, we must remain vigilant but nimble in our approach. This requires us to recognize and follow three innovation related principles: First, we must be willing to develop an understanding of new technology. Second, we must be open in considering how we approach innovation. And finally, we must prioritize how we integrate innovation as we revise or enhance regulatory frameworks.\nTurning back to why we are here today: This conference was launched back in 2017. It has grown in standing and relevance every year since. As President Harker noted in his remarks yesterday, the conference has become a System highlight because of its ability to focus on and keep pace with the change of technology. This conference also embodies the principles I just articulated of working to understand new technologies, having an openness to innovation, and considering policy choices that enable integration of financial technology in the banking and financial system. Year-after-year, this event provides an opportunity for us to come together to engage and learn about fintech issues, keeping an eye toward the future.\nBut we must recognize that the success and growth of this conference is due to the leadership and vision of President Harker. For those who may not be aware, at the end of June next year, President Harker will reach the Federal Reserve retirement requirements, and unfortunately, this will be his final Fintech Conference as President and CEO of the Philadelphia Fed.\nI want to congratulate Pat on the creation and success of this conference, and to look forward to the ongoing and future legacy he has created for the Philadelphia Reserve Bank with this event.\nPresident Harker is, by his own admission, an \"accidental economist.\" He's an engineer first and, in fact, came to the field of economics through an engineering issue that required economics to solve. Well, as someone who has sat at the Federal Open Market Committee conference table with President Harker for the past six years, I can attest to this approach\u00e2\u0080\u0094he enlists this engineering perspective to assist in understanding economic issues.\nThat methodical approach to issues, and his willingness to look deep under the proverbial hood, is his hallmark at the Philadelphia Fed. Through his leadership, the Bank has built strong partnerships with communities throughout the Third District who know they can rely on this institution for expert knowledge and data research that are critical to working through local concerns.\nIt was also under his leadership that the Philadelphia Fed's Consumer Finance Institute took its current shape. Today, the Institute's multidisciplinary approach to issues\u00e2\u0080\u0094bringing together economists, industry and regulatory experts, and community development specialists\u00e2\u0080\u0094is redefining our understanding of consumer credit and payments. And, he has positioned the Philadelphia Fed as a true thought leader in technology and innovation, and in the application of both hard and soft data.\nThis conference is just the most public example of this. His decision, nearly a decade ago, to give the green light to a conference specifically geared to fintech proves that President Harker is clearly standing in the center of the intersection of engineering and economics.\nSo, while I do not wish to detract from any of our speakers, panelists, and presenters today, I must recognize and thank President Harker for his forward-looking leadership. The Third District and the Federal Reserve System are both better for his service. Pat, thank you!\nTo close, thank you again for allowing me these few moments to start the day. I look forward to today's discussion and to our conversations.\n1.

Waller\nAt the Vienna Macroeconomics Workshop, Institute of Advanced Studies, Vienna, Austria\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for inviting me to speak today.\n1\nI have participated in this conference for nearly 20 years and have often presented my research on monetary theory, banking, and payments. So, I believe this is the right audience to speak to regarding the role of centralized finance and the emergence of decentralized finance, or defi for short. Over the past few years, there has been a lot of attention and work on defi, which will be a major focus of my remarks. Many argue that defi will replace traditional centralized finance while others argue that it merely extends traditional finance methods and trading activities onto new platforms. It is in this sense that I want to address the question of whether centralized finance and defi are substitutes or complements to each other.\nAdvances associated with defi have the potential to profoundly affect financial market trading. While I believe these advances could lead to efficiency gains, I recognize the significant value that has been delivered for centuries by financial intermediaries and through centralized financial markets. Before I share my views on the promise of these new technologies, let me tell you where I'm coming from on these issues.\nI am an economist, and so my first inclination is to think about the underlying economics driving an issue. But to understand the value proposition of defi, it is useful to first recall why\ncentralized\nfinancial market trading arose in the first place. Centralized finance clearly provides benefits to people, but obviously also comes with some costs. I am going to take a few minutes to discuss those benefits and costs before turning to the question at hand.\nLet's start with the economics of trading. Most financial trades are \"pairwise\" in that the seller of an object needs to find a buyer of that exact object. The problem is that it is often complicated, costly, and time-consuming to search for a buyer. This gives rise to the need for someone to step in and help buyers and sellers match in a faster and less costly manner. In short, there is a profit opportunity for someone to intermediate the trade.\nAnother name for intermediaries is middlemen. Why would we pay a middleman? In their paper from nearly 40 years ago, Ariel Rubenstein and Asher Wolinsky described it eloquently: \"What makes the middlemen's activity possible is the time-consuming nature of the trade, which enables middlemen to extract surplus in return for shortening the time period that sellers and buyers have to wait for a transaction.\"\n2\nLet me contextualize the value of middlemen with an example I used for years when teaching money and banking. Suppose you had some extra income from saving and wanted to lend it out to earn interest. How would you do that? First, you would have to advertise that you had funds to lend. Then, you would have to wait for the right person who needed that exact amount of funds, which could be a long time. Once you met the right person, you would have to negotiate when repayment would occur. Next, you would need to know a lot of information about the person receiving your funds and the likelihood you would get repaid. This is needed to assess the risk of the transaction and the compensation you would need to give up your funds. You would also need a lot of legal advice to draw up a contract and stipulate how the contract would be enforced under a range of conditions. Finally, since you are the sole source of funding, you will bear the entire cost of a default. It should be clear that this would be a daunting exercise for most people and explains why they would turn to a middleman who specializes in this type of activity to do all this on their behalf.\nIt is for these reasons that banks arose as early as in ancient Mesopotamia to carry out some of these functions.\n3\nSimilar issues arise when it comes to other ways of transferring resources from one person to another, as occurs from non-bank debt, equities and insurance contracts. Many point to trades of shares in the Dutch East India Trading Company in Amsterdam in the 1660s as the origins of the first modern stock exchange. Lloyds of London was founded as a means of pooling funds to share risk and return in the shipping industry, thus becoming the first insurance firm. The fact that similar arrangements still exist centuries later is a testament to the value of intermediation and centralized financial trading.\nHowever, these arrangements are not without drawbacks. An obvious drawback of intermediation from the perspective of those wishing to trade is that those middlemen must get paid. That is, there are transaction costs. Another drawback of intermediation is that you typically must turn over control of your assets, such as savings or stocks, to the intermediary for them to be traded. This creates a classic \"principal-agent\" problem whereby incentives between the principal\u00e2\u0080\u0094you\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the agent\u00e2\u0080\u0094the intermediary\u00e2\u0080\u0094may not be aligned. That can raise concerns about custody arrangements and recourse to regain control of one's assets. Intermediation also requires recordkeeping arrangements that customers can trust accurately reflect their true holdings. In other words, centralized finance requires a substantial amount of trust. With all that in mind, let me turn to how and why technological innovations have given rise to defi.\nIn a capitalist system, the existence of profits provides incentives for others to enter the market, offer a better product, and compete away any excess profits. This can be done by the creation of new financial firms that can provide the same or better service at a lower cost. Often that occurs through innovations and exploiting new technologies. Think about how the invention of the telegraph and the telephone revolutionized trading. More recently, the advent of the internet further advanced the ease and speed of financial trading. These are examples of how financial trading has evolved over time. And the next wave of innovations in financial market trading could be driven by technological advances that alleviate some potential drawbacks of the centralized approach.\nOften broad technological advances emanate from narrower efforts to design products or processes that solve specific problems. For example, one technology used to support portable home appliances like vacuum cleaners was originally developed to support the space program.\n4\nSimilarly, the development of crypto-assets led to the development of technologies that are fueling possibilities in defi.\nWe don't have enough time for me to cover the full history of crypto-assets, but I will focus on several key elements that have affected the evolution toward defi. An early crypto-asset\u00e2\u0080\u0094Bitcoin\u00e2\u0080\u0094was developed to function in a world in which trust among individuals did not exist. Rather than relying on intermediaries which require trust, Bitcoin relied on technology to facilitate trade. Bitcoin was also designed for privacy. No one would know who was buying or selling Bitcoin. This was achieved through cryptographic technology and private keys. In addition, it allowed individuals to maintain control of their crypto-assets throughout the entire trading process. That is, they no longer had to delegate control to others. Finally, all records were kept on a form of distributed ledger called a blockchain, which has design features that promote transparency and are censorship-proof. No individual or government could destroy the records of trades or take ownership of the objects traded.\nWith that history in mind and before we delve into the question of whether defi and centralized finance are substitutes or complements, I think it is useful to carefully define some terms. This will make sure we're all talking about the same things. As I described in a speech last year, I think of the crypto ecosystem as consisting of three parts:\na crypto-asset, which generally refers to any digital object traded using cryptographic techniques;\ntechnology that directly facilitates trading crypto-assets; this includes smart contracts and tokenization;\n5\nand\na database management protocol used to record trades and ownership of assets, commonly referred to as the blockchain, which includes both permissioned and permissionless distributed ledger technologies.\nIt is easy to see how the emergence of these technologies could lead one to think of defi as a\nsubstitute\nfor centralized finance. For example, the technologies are allowing for individuals to trade assets without giving up control of those assets to an intermediary\u00e2\u0080\u0094a critical distinction with centralized finance.\nHowever, there are other uses emerging from these technologies that look more like\ncomplements\nto centralized finance. For example, distributed ledger technology, or DLT, may be an efficient and faster way to do recordkeeping in a 24/7 trading world. We already see several financial institutions experimenting with DLT for traditional repo trading that occurs 24/7. But before these ledgers can be used to facilitate transactions in traditional assets\u00e2\u0080\u0094like debt, equity, and real estate\u00e2\u0080\u0094these assets must be tokenized. Undertaking the process to tokenize assets and use distributed ledgers like blockchain can speed up transfers of assets and take advantage of another innovation: smart contracts.\nRather than relying on each party to separately carry out the transaction, smart contracts can effectively combine multiple legs of a transaction into a single unified act executed by a smart contract. This can provide value as it can mitigate risks associated with settlement and counterparty risks by ensuring the buyer will not pay if the seller does not deliver. While these efforts are still in early stages, the functionality could expand to a broad set of financial activities. The bottom line is that things like DLT, tokenization, and smart contracts are just technologies for trading that can be used in defi or also to improve efficiency in centralized finance. That is why I see them as complements.\nStablecoins are another important innovation in defi. Stablecoins were created in the crypto universe in hopes of providing a \"safe\" asset with a stable value for trading. Nearly all stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar one-for-one. They provide an opportunity for buyers and sellers to transact in a decentralized fashion with the stablecoin used as the settlement instrument. Because they are effectively digital currency, stablecoins can reduce the need for payment intermediaries and thereby reduce costs of payments globally. But their safety is not assured. History is replete with cases in which synthetic dollars became subject to runs. Stablecoins thus face all of the same issues any substitute for genuine U.S. dollars faces. If appropriate guardrails can be erected to minimize run risk and mitigate other risks, such as their potential use in illicit finance, then stablecoins may have benefits in payments and by serving as a safe asset on a variety of new trading platforms.\nThese technologies will almost certainly lead to efficiency gains over time, but as they develop, we should think carefully about their role in the broader financial landscape.\nIs it really possible to completely decentralize finance using these technologies? The answer is obviously \"no.\" Intermediation is still valuable for the average person, and we see this by the existence of trading exchanges in the crypto world. All these platforms involve giving custody of one's crypto-assets to an intermediary, who conducts trades on behalf of the client. This reintroduces the need for trust in these platforms just as trust is needed in modern banking systems.\nReturning to the technologies behind defi, one must ask whether there are unique risks associated with the use of these technologies. If so, what is the nature of these risks? Are they contained to just those people directly engaging with the technologies, or could there be broader spillovers to society? For example, can these technologies increase the risk of inadvertently providing funds to bad actors? In centralized finance there are regulations that require banks to know who their clients are. Are similar rules and regulations needed around some of these new technologies? When it comes to our financial plumbing, which affects every person or business in one way or another, I think a balanced view of expeditious disruption and long-term sustainability is merited.\nSo where does that leave us? Ultimately, I believe that advances in technology have the potential to drive efficiency gains in finance, just as technological innovation has done for centuries. While there are certain services emerging through defi that cannot be provided by centralized finance, the technological innovations stemming from defi are largely complementary to centralized finance. They have the potential to improve centralized finance, thereby increasing the significant value that financial intermediaries and centralized financial markets deliver. I look forward to seeing the continued evolution of financial technology and the benefits that evolution will bring to the households and businesses served by the financial system.\n1.

Waller\nAt \u00e2\u0080\u009cA 50 Year Retrospective on the Shadow Open Market Committee and  Its Role in Monetary Policy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a conference sponsored by the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Stanford, California\nShare\nThank you, Athanasios, and thank you for the opportunity to be part of this very worthy celebration.\n1\nIn support of the theme of this conference, I do have some thoughts on the Shadow Open Market Committee's contributions to the policy debate, in particular its advocacy for policy rules. But before I get to that, I am going to exercise the keynote speaker's freedom to talk about whatever I want. To that end, I want to take a few minutes to offer my views on the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy. So let me start there, and afterward I will discuss the role that policy rules play in my decision making and in the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nIn the three weeks or so since the most recent FOMC meeting, data we have received has been uneven, as it sometimes has been over the past year. I continue to judge that the U.S. economy is on a solid footing, with employment near the FOMC's maximum employment objective and inflation in the vicinity of our target, even though the latest inflation data was disappointing.\nReal gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the first half of 2024, and I expect it to grow a bit faster in the third quarter. The Blue Chip consensus of private sector forecasters predicts 2.3 percent, while the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model, based on up-to-the moment data, is predicting real growth of 3.2 percent.\nEarlier, there were concerns that GDP in the first half of this year was overstating the strength of the economy, since gross domestic income (GDI) was estimated to have grown a mere 1.3 percent in the first half of this year, suggesting a big downward revision to GDP was coming. But revisions received after our most recent FOMC meeting showed the opposite\u00e2\u0080\u0094GDI growth was revised up substantially to 3.2 percent. This change in turn led to an upward revision in the personal saving rate of about 2 percentage points in the second quarter, leaving it at 5.2 percent in June. This revision suggests that household resources for future consumption are actually in good shape, although data and anecdotal evidence suggests lower-income groups are struggling. These revisions suggest that the economy is much stronger than previously thought, with little indication of a major slowdown in economic activity.\nThat outlook is supported by consumer spending that has been and continues to be strong. Though the growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has moderated since the second half of 2023, it has continued at an average pace of close to 2.5 percent so far this year. Also, my business contacts believe that there is considerable pent-up demand for durable goods, home improvements, and other big-ticket items, demand that built up due to high interest rates for credit cards and home equity loans. Now that rates have started to come down and are expected to come down more, consumers will be eager to make those purchases. For business spending, purchasing managers for manufacturers describe ongoing weakness in that sector, but those for the large majority of businesses outside of manufacturing continue to report a solid expansion of activity.\nNow let's talk about the labor market. Only a couple months ago, it appeared that the labor market was cooling too quickly. Low numbers for job creation and a jump in the unemployment rate from 4.1 percent in June to 4.3 percent in July raised risks that the labor market was deteriorating. To remind you of how bad the markets viewed the July data, some Fed watchers were calling for an emergency FOMC meeting to discuss a rate cut. While the unemployment rate ticked down in August, job growth was once again well below expectations. Many were arguing that the labor market was on the verge of a serious deterioration and that the Fed was behind the curve even after a 50 basis point cut in the policy rate at the September FOMC meeting.\nThen we got the September employment report. Job creation in September was unexpectedly strong at 254,000 and the unemployment rate fell back down to 4.1 percent, which is where it was in June. The report also showed big upward revisions to payroll gains for the previous two months. Together, the message was loud and clear: While job creation has moderated and the unemployment rate has risen over the past year, the labor market remains quite healthy.\nAlong with other new data on the labor market, the evidence is that labor supply and demand have come into balance. The number of job vacancies, a sign of strength in the labor market, has fallen gradually since the beginning of the year. The ratio of vacancies to unemployed is at 1.2, about the level in 2019, which was a pretty strong labor market. To put this number into perspective, recent research has shown that this ratio has been above 1 only three times since 1960.\n2\nThe quits rate, another sign of labor market strength, has fallen lower than it was in 2019, a decrease which partly reflects that the hiring rate has fallen as labor supply and demand have come into better balance.\nIn sum, based on payrolls, the unemployment rate and job revisions, there has been a very gradual moderation in labor demand relative to supply, but not a deterioration. The stability of the labor market, as reflected in these two measures as well as the other metrics I mentioned, bolsters my confidence that we can achieve further progress toward the FOMC's inflation goal while supporting a healthy labor market that adds jobs and boosts wages and living standards for workers.\nI will be looking for more evidence to support this outlook in the weeks and months to come. But, unfortunately, it won't be easy to interpret the October jobs report to be released just before the next FOMC meeting. This report will most likely show a significant but temporary loss of jobs from the two recent hurricanes and the strike at Boeing. I expect these factors may reduce employment growth by more than 100,000 this month, and there may be a small effect on the unemployment rate, but I'm not sure it will be that visible. Since the jobs report will come during the usual blackout period for policymakers commenting on the economy, you won't have any of us trying to put this low reading into perspective, though I hope others will.\nLooking ahead, I expect payroll gains to moderate from their current pace but continue at a solid rate. The unemployment rate may drift a bit higher but is likely to remain quite low in historical terms. While I believe the labor market is on a solid footing, I will continue to watch the full range of data for signs of weakness.\nMeanwhile, inflation, after showing considerable progress for several months toward the FOMC's 2 percent target, likely moved up in September. The consumer price index grew 0.2 percent over the past month, 2.1 percent over the past three months, 1.6 percent over six months and 2.4 percent in the past year. Oil prices fell over most of the summer but then more recently have surged. Excluding energy and also food prices that likewise tend to be volatile, and just as it did in August, core CPI inflation printed at 0.3 percent in September and 3.3 percent over the past year.\nPrivate-sector forecasts are predicting that PCE inflation, the FOMC's preferred measure, will also move up in September. Core PCE prices are expected to have risen around 0.25 percent last month. While not a welcome development, if the monthly core PCE inflation number comes in around this level, over the last 5 months it is still running very close to 2 percent on an annualized basis. We have made a lot of progress on inflation over the course of the last year and half, but that progress has clearly been uneven\u00e2\u0080\u0094at times it feels like being on a rollercoaster. Whether or not this month's inflation reading is just noise or if it signals ongoing increases, is yet to be seen. I will be watching the data carefully to see how persistent this recent uptick is.\nThe FOMC's inflation goal is an average of 2 percent over the longer run and there are some good reasons to think that price increases will be modest going forward. I am hearing reports from firms that their pricing power seems to have waned as consumers have become more sensitive to price changes. There has also been a steady slowing in the growth of labor compensation. It is true that average hourly earnings growth in September ticked up to 4 percent over the past year. And though it might seem like wage increases of 4 percent a year would put upward pressure on inflation that is near 2 percent, that might not be true if one considers productivity, which has grown at an average annual rate of 2.9 percent for the past five quarters. Some of this strength was making up for productivity that shrank due to the pandemic, but the longer it continues\u00e2\u0080\u0094up 2.5 percent for the second quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0094the better productivity supports wage growth of 4 percent, or even higher, without driving up inflation. All that said, I will be watching all the data related to inflation closely.\nWith the labor market in rough balance, employment near its maximum level, and inflation generally running close to our target over the past several months, I want to do what I can as a policymaker to keep the economy on this path. For me, the central question is how much and how fast to reduce the target for the federal funds rate, which I believe is currently set at a restrictive level. To help answer questions like this, I often look at various monetary policy rules to assess the appropriate setting of policy. Policy rules have long been of serious interest to the Shadow Open Market Committee. So before I turn to my views on the future path of policy, I thought I would talk about monetary policy rules versus discretion and begin with some background about the use of rules at the FOMC.\nFor a brief overview of the history of the advent of rules at the Board, I have been directed to the second chapter of\nThe Taylor Rule and the Transformation of Monetary Policy\nwritten by George Kahn, and I have also consulted the memories of longtime members of the Board staff.\n3\nRules came along in the 1990s as the Fed was moving away from monetary targeting, focusing more on interest-rate policy, and taking its first major steps toward increased transparency. There was immediate interest in Taylor-type rules among Fed staff, and even some contributions of research.\n4\nThere was a presentation to the FOMC on rules in 1995, and that was the same year that John Taylor's Bay Area colleague, Janet Yellen, was apparently the first policymaker to mention the Taylor rule at an FOMC meeting. While FOMC decisions mimicked a Taylor rule much of the time under Chairman Alan Greenspan, he was famously an advocate of \"constructive ambiguity\" in communication, and he and other central bankers since have resisted the suggestion that decisions could be handed over to strict rules. Today, of course, a number of rules-based analyses are included in the material submitted to policymakers ahead of every FOMC meeting, and we publish the policy prescriptions of different rules as part of the Board's semi-annual\nMonetary Policy Report\n. Rules have become part of the furniture in modern policymaking.\nAs everyone here knows, but for the benefit of other listeners, Taylor rules relate the level of the policy interest rate to a limited number of other economic variables, most often including the deviation of inflation from a target value and a measure of resource use in the economy relative to some long-run trend.\n5\nThere are numerous forms of the Taylor rule, but they generally fall into two categories.\nThe first of these, an inertial rule, has the property that the policy rate changes only slowly over time. I tend to think of it as an approach that captures the reaction function of a policymaker in a stable economy where the forces that would tend to change the economy and policy build over time. When change does occur, a gradual response may give policymakers time to assess the true state of the economy and the possible effects of their decision. One example I can use is the steadfastness of policymakers in the latter part of 2023, when inflation fell more rapidly than was widely expected, and again in early 2024, when it briefly escalated. The FOMC did not change course either time, an approach validated by inertial rules.\nA non-inertial rule, on the other hand, allows and in fact calls for relatively quick adjustments to policy. The guidance from these rules is more useful when there is a turning point in the economy, and policymakers need to stay ahead of events. One saw these non-inertial rules prescribe a sharper rise in the policy rate above the effective lower bound starting in 2021 as inflation began climbing above the FOMC's 2 percent target. Non-inertial rules are also more useful in the face of major shocks to the economy such as the 2008 financial crisis and the start of the pandemic.\nThe great promise of rules is that they provide a simple and reliable guide to policy, but what should one do when different rules recommend different policy actions given the same economic conditions? Right now, inertial rules tell us to move slowly in reducing policy rates toward a neutral stance that neither restricts nor stimulates the economy. On the other hand, non-inertial rules tell us to cut the policy rate more aggressively, subject to the caveat that one is certain of the values of all the 'star' variables: U*, Y* and r*. I think the answer is that while rules are valuable in helping analyze policy options, they have limitations. Among these are the limits of the data considered, which is typically narrower than the range of data that policymakers use to make decisions, and also the fact that simple policy rules do not take into account risk management, which is often a critical consideration in policy decisions. So, while policy rules serve as a good check on discretionary policy, there are times when discretion is needed. As a result, I prefer to think of them as \"policy rules of thumb\".\nTurning to my view for the path for policy, let me discuss three scenarios that I have had in mind to manage the risks of upcoming decisions in the medium term.\nThe first scenario is one where the overall strong economic developments that I have described today continue, with inflation nearing the FOMC's target and the unemployment rate moving up only slightly. This scenario implies to me that we can proceed wi",

Among many things, banks offer financial education, sponsorships and funding for community programs and events. Without question, community banks are important and integral to the local economy.\nBut community banks also face challenges that require proactive risk management, effective and efficient prioritization of compliance resources, and the need to innovate. Today, I would like to briefly highlight some of the issues banks are facing and discuss ways that community banks and regulators can more effectively work together in the future.\nThe Challenges Facing Community Banks\nAs this audience knows well, community banks face a number of challenges. They often rely on third-party service providers to offer products and services to their customers. It may be more difficult for them to hire and retain qualified staff or plan for future leadership with management succession planning. Given limited staffing, they may be overwhelmed by the recent onslaught of new regulations and guidance. And in light of all of this, it may be challenging to prioritize resources in order to appropriately focus on the most important risks facing their businesses. While the headwinds may seem overwhelming, community banks are always resilient in the face of change.\nOften, one of the greatest challenges facing a community bank is not about managing any particular risk but rather how to address all of the risks they face\u00e2\u0080\u0094and how to\nprioritize\nthe approach to address each of those risks. Regulators have, at times, exacerbated these challenges through policy choices. The risk of mis-prioritization is not limited to community banks. In my mind, this was most recently evident in the events and supervision leading to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. Management failed to address growing interest rate risk and funding risks, and supervisors failed to prioritize and escalate these issues. Our goal should be to identify, understand, and learn from these past mistakes, and to avoid repeating them.\nBoth regulators and banks should be working toward a common goal\u00e2\u0080\u0094a banking system that supports economic activity throughout the country, in which banks operate in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with consumer laws and regulations. In considering the challenges facing community banks, both regulators and banks have an important role to play.\nCompetition\nCommunity banks face competitive pressures from many sources. These pressures may result from local or regional economic conditions, the needs of retail and business customers, and the products and services available in the market. Competitors can take the form of traditional banks, internet banks, and non-banks like fin-techs and mortgage companies. While fin-tech partnerships can be beneficial to both the customer and the bank, if the relationship is not managed according to safe and sound banking principles, serious problems can result. When deposits are accepted through fin-tech relationships but not handled appropriately, deposit insurance can be jeopardized and the ability to access deposited funds may be impacted.\n3\nCompetition can also come from other local competitors like credit unions, large banks with a broader operational footprint, payday lenders, or other nonbank credit sources. As bank customers grow increasingly comfortable and familiar with new mechanisms for doing business, the use of online banking has continued to expand. This has tended to increase the footprint of non-local banks or lenders, enabling them to effectively compete for business outside of their geographic area. Even against this backdrop, research shows that community banks have maintained an important role in many banking markets, including in small- and medium-sized business lending.\n4\nThe regulatory framework establishes expectations for how community banks can compete, and often creates an unlevel playing field with many of these competitors. This includes whether they are subject to the same regulation as banks that engage in the same activities and how competition is evaluated.\nA core concept in financial regulation is to impose the same regulation\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I suggest we expand this to include the same regulation, guidance, and supervisory expectations\u00e2\u0080\u0094on entities that are engaged in the same activities. Banks compete against many non-bank providers, including financial technology firms, credit unions, and other non-bank lenders. In some of these head-to-head competitions, community banks face distinct disadvantages that can pose challenges when competing for the same banking opportunities. For example, banks are subject to taxes and additional regulatory requirements (including the Community Reinvestment Act). They are also subject to a broader range of restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements or the \"soft\" power of supervision. In all of these cases, the disparity in the legal framework can have a distortive effect on competition. In short, where the financial regulatory framework can provide for parity of treatment, it should do so. The regulatory framework should not knowingly distort competition, or effectively impose a regulatory allocation of credit.\nThe framework also plays an important role in assessing competition among banks. The mergers and acquisitions (M&A) approval process can have a disproportionate impact on community banks because the \"screens\" that are used to evaluate the competitive effects of a proposed merger often result in a finding that M&A transactions in rural markets can have an adverse effect on competition and should therefore be disallowed.\n5\nEven when these transactions are eventually approved, the mechanical approach to analyzing competitive effects\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is grounded in the effect of proposed transactions on the control of deposits within individual banking markets\u00e2\u0080\u0094often requires additional review or analysis, and can lead to delays in the regulatory approval process.\nCybersecurity\nCommunity banks often note cybersecurity and third-party risk management as areas that raise significant concerns. Cyber-related events, including ransomware attacks and business email compromises, are costly and time-consuming experiences, and they pose unique challenges for community banks. For example, the maintenance of and the technology resources required to support a successful cybersecurity program are often difficult for smaller banks. Regulators can promote cybersecurity, and stronger cyber-incident \"resilience\" and response capabilities by identifying resources and opportunities for banks to develop \"muscle memory\" in cyber incident response.\nRecent incidents, like the Crowdstrike-related outage, have highlighted the heavy dependence many banks have on technology, third-party providers, and the broader supply chain. In the current risk environment, it is important for banks of all sizes to implement sound operational resilience, cybersecurity, and third-party risk-management practices. One important resource for community banks is the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) website, which includes the FFIEC Cybersecurity Resource Guide and links to other external cybersecurity resources.\nThe Federal Reserve plays an important role in supervising banks and supporting risk management practices. For example, the Federal Reserve hosts the Midwest Cyber Workshop, with the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis.\n6\nOver the past two years, this workshop has provided a forum to further cyber risk discussions among community bankers, regulators, law enforcement, and other industry stakeholders. Today's Symposium also includes an interactive cyber workshop, during which participants will participate in a cyber exercise, working through the various decisions that would be required in responding to a hypothetical cyberattack.\n7\nWe know well that cyber threats pose real risks to the banking system. We also recognize that community banks may have unique needs in preventing, remediating, and responding to cyber threats. Therefore, regulators should ensure that a range of resources are available to support community banks and seek further opportunities to help build community bank resilience against these threats.\nThird-Party Risk Management\nThird-party risk management can pose an additional challenge for community banks. Due to their size and scale, community banks often leverage centralized resources\u00e2\u0080\u0094technical experts who have greater expertise than the bank could fully maintain on staff\u00e2\u0080\u0094to advise and assist on a range of issues. Often these third-party service providers are significantly larger, and their bank clients\u00e2\u0080\u0094including smaller banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094may lack leverage in conducting due diligence and negotiating the terms of the relationship.\nIn 2023, the federal banking agencies published supervisory guidance addressing third-party risk management, which was expressly applicable to community banks. As I noted at the time it was issued, the guidance included shortcomings that were known and identified but not addressed in advance.\n8\nWhat many of you may not know is that after nearly a year from the original publication, the regulators published a guide to assist community banks\ninterpret\nand\napply\nthe guidance to their third-party risk management activities. The guide was intended to provide additional context for the guidance\u00e2\u0080\u0094including step-by-step examples of how to address third-party risk management\u00e2\u0080\u0094making the guidance more useful. While I am pleased that the community bank implementation guide was eventually published, the delays in its publication suggest a shortcoming in our regulatory approach. We must ensure new guidance provides clarity to regulated firms on its own, or that we provide additional resources at the time the guidance is published.\nConsumer Compliance\nLike third-party risk management, consumer compliance can be another area that may present challenges to community banks given their size and scale. An effective and well-run consumer compliance program balances consumer protection with the complexity and cost to establish a robust compliance management program. One challenge for community banks is the difficulty in retaining qualified consumer compliance experts. Notwithstanding these challenges, community banks devote significant time and resources to their consumer compliance risk management programs. Compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations, including fair lending laws, is essential to ensuring that the banking system provides fair and broad access to credit and financial services.\nCommunity banks take these responsibilities seriously, and the overwhelming majority of banks that we supervise invest in strong compliance management systems to prevent violations and detect problems before they occur. When consumer compliance concerns arise, banks address them by making their customers whole and adopting the necessary changes to ensure that issues do not persist or reoccur. In a very small subset of cases, banks fall short of their obligations, and we hold those institutions accountable through enforcement actions or other supervisory actions.\nThe Federal Reserve's consumer compliance supervision program is risk-focused and tailored to a bank's compliance risk, focused on the activities that present the greatest risk. One example related to third-party risk management is our recent system supervisory focus on consumer compliance risks associated with fin-tech relationships. As a result of this work, our supervisors seek to identify the parties to relationships that pose the greatest risk of consumer harm. This effort promotes our understanding of higher risk fin-tech partners across the Federal Reserve System, and helps supervisors proactively identify relationships that pose greater risk of consumer harm.\nOther Core Risks\nThere are a number of \"core\" risks that are essential for bank management to address. These \"core\" risks\u00e2\u0080\u0094including funding, liquidity and credit risk\u00e2\u0080\u0094should already be integrated into management priorities, since they pose the greatest threats to a bank's operations.\nFocusing on core risks is second nature for community banks. In contrast, supervision can be susceptible to diversion from core to non-core risks leading supervisors to neglect the build-up of traditional risk. Diverting resources to non-core risks can often leave a bank vulnerable, especially when regulators direct banks to allocate resources in other ways, whether by regulation, guidance, or through supervisory expectations.\nMitigating Risks to Community Banks\nThe design of regulation, guidance, and supervisory approach regulators rely upon for community banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the intentional policy choices that underpin this framework\u00e2\u0080\u0094are important for ensuring their effectiveness in supporting the safety and soundness of the banking system. These design choices can enable community banks to operate successfully while mitigating risks, leveraging tailoring, transparency, and consistency across institutions.\n9\nI have spoken at length about these themes in the past, but I would like to reiterate just a few of the critical elements of a regulatory agenda that will allow community banks to thrive in the future:\nFirst, we need to revisit size thresholds over time as inflation and economic growth slowly erode our regulatory categories. The bank regulatory framework is built largely upon asset-based size thresholds, and these thresholds should reflec",

Cook\nAt the 2024 Women for Women Summit, Charleston, South Carolina\nShare\nThank you for the kind introduction, Jennet.\n1\nLet me start by saying my thoughts are with all the people in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia who have felt the force of Helene's and Milton's impact. I am saddened by the tragic loss of life and widespread disruption in this region. The Federal Reserve Board and other federal and state financial regulatory agencies are working with banks and credit unions in the affected area. As we normally do in these unfortunate situations, we are encouraging institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the needs of their communities.\n2\nIt is an honor to stand before you and speak to this group of audacious, innovative women. I am also very happy to be back in Charleston. I grew up in Milledgeville, Georgia, just about 250 miles down the road. Some of my fondest childhood memories of traveling in the South, especially as a Girl Scout, include South Carolina.\nToday I would like to talk with you about the important role startups, new businesses, and entrepreneurship play in our economy from the perspective of a Federal Reserve policymaker. I also want to share a bit of my story. Just like many of you\u00e2\u0080\u0094including those who have started a business or those who dream of doing that someday\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have faced and overcome hurdles along a winding path.\nMy Story\nI was born and raised in Milledgeville, where my mother, Professor Mary Murray Cook, was a faculty member in the Nursing Department of Georgia College and State University. She was the first tenured African American faculty member at that university. My father, Rev. Payton B. Cook, was a chaplain and then in senior leadership at the hospital there. My family lived through the events that brought Milledgeville out of a deeply segregated South. My sisters and I were among the first African American students to desegregate the schools we attended. I drew strength from the example set by my family, others in the Civil Rights Movement, and the village that raised me and from their conviction in the hope and promise of a world that could and would continually improve.\nWhile I had an interest in economics even before I entered high school, that was not the initial field of study I pursued. I entered Spelman College in Atlanta as a physics and philosophy major. After graduation, I had the honor of studying at the University of Oxford as a Marshall Scholar.\nAfter Oxford, I continued my education at the University of Dakar in Senegal in West Africa. However, at the end of my year in Africa, it was the chance to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania in East Africa where I discovered my love of economics. I hiked alongside a British economist, and, by the end of the trek, he convinced me that studying economics would provide me with the tools to address some big and important questions I had pondered for a long time.\nI went on to earn my Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley\n. Entering the economics profession came with its usual challenges, and, for women, a few more challenges existed. To this day, women are still underrepresented in economics. Women earned just 34 percent of bachelor's degrees in economics and 36 percent of Ph.D.'s in economics in 2022, the most recent available data from the U.S. Department of Education. The share of women earning those degrees rose only modestly from 1999, when women earned about 32 percent of economics bachelor's degrees and 27 percent of Ph.D.'s. The data stand in sharp contrast to all science and engineering degrees, including in social science fields, where women earned roughly half of degrees granted in 2022.\n3\nEducation was paramount in my family and was construed as a means of realizing the promise of the Civil Rights Movement and continual improvement of our society and economy. Of course, economics, like physics, is a field where math skills are vitally important. Between my mother, my aunts, and my extended family, I had essentially understood STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics)-related jobs to be women's work. I was grateful to have these role models in my orbit to give me the confidence to undertake study in a STEM field.\nAccess and encouragement for girls to pursue study in math and science are a significant concern. Economist Dania V. Francis's research shows that Black girls are disproportionately under-recommended for Advanced Placement calculus.\n4\nThe course is often a gateway for economics, for STEM classes, and for college preparation, in general.\n5\nMy mentors and role models encouraged careful study, teaching, and scholarship and helped me block out the voices saying I did not belong at each juncture. They encouraged my work and have been champions for me. As a result, I have been committed to serving as a mentor, as well. For several years, I was the director of and taught in the American Economic Association's Summer Program, an important training ground for disadvantaged students considering economics careers. Each year, the share of students who are women oscillated between 41 percent and 67 percent, much higher than the enrollment in undergraduate economics courses nationally.\n6\nI told those students\u00e2\u0080\u0094and continue to tell them as they make their way through graduate programs in economics and through the economics profession\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"You belong here. Your insights are unique, and the profession will benefit from them.\"\nIn my career as an economist, I studied, researched, and taught in roles at universities and worked in the private sector and in government before I was nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate to become a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 2022. I am honored and humbled to serve in this role and proud to be the first African American woman and first woman of color to serve on the Board of Governors. As Fed policymakers, we make decisions affecting the entire economy and the well-being of every American by focusing on the dual mandate given to us by Congress: maximum employment and stable prices.\nEntrepreneurs' Vital Role in the Economy\nIn my years of conducting research and while at the Board, I have met many inventors, innovators, and entrepreneurs who made important contributions to the economy. Many of them happened to be women who were very knowledgeable, creative, and inspiring. So I want to discuss the vital role entrepreneurship and new business creation play in our economy.\nYou might ask what interest I have in this subject, as a monetary policymaker focused closely on the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. Well, this topic has interested me for a long time, and I conducted a fair amount of research on entrepreneurship and innovation before joining the Board. But the topic is also important precisely because of our dual mandate. To convince you of this, I will explain a few of the ways in which economists think about entrepreneurship, and how they relate to the dual mandate.\nThe first is the most basic: For many people\u00e2\u0080\u0094many millions, in fact\u00e2\u0080\u0094entrepreneurship or self-employment is a career choice.\n7\nIt is their preferred way of participating in the labor market and obtaining income for themselves and their families. They prefer to be their own bosses, with all the benefits and risks that entails.\n8\nBut whether they end up hiring others or not, self-employed individuals support the labor market by providing a job for themselves.\nA second way economists think about entrepreneurship is a little broader: New business creation is a large contributor to overall job growth. In fact, new businesses punch above their weight. For example, during the handful of years before the pandemic, in a typical year only about 8 percent of all employer firms were new entrants, but these new entrants accounted for about 15 percent of annual gross job creation.\n9\nAnd research has found that this job creation effect is long lasting. Even though many new firms do not survive, those that do survive tend to grow rapidly over 5 to 10 years, largely offsetting the job losses from those firms that shut down.\n10\nA third way economists think about entrepreneurship, which I have explored in my own research, is that a small but critical subset of new firms are innovators\u00e2\u0080\u0094they introduce new products or business processes that change how we consume or produce.\n11\nAs such, they make large contributions to overall productivity growth over time. That is, innovative entrepreneurs help enable us to do more with less\u00e2\u0080\u0094and even more so if access to innovation participation is equitable.\n12\nIt is important that everyone, including women, historically underrepresented groups, people from certain geographic regions, and other diverse representative groups, can participate in the entrepreneurship and innovation economy. In my research, I have found that investors underrate the prospects of Black-founded, or simply outsider-founded, startups in early funding stages. Better assessment of the early stages of invention and innovation could broaden the range of new entrants and the ideas they contribute to their local communities and the broader economy.\nConsider the Dual Mandate\nSo let's return to the dual mandate. You can now understand that self-employment and entrepreneurial job creation are relevant for our employment mandate. Indeed, one could argue that entrepreneurs are critical to Fed policymakers' efforts to promote maximum employment. And the productivity gains we reap from entrepreneurship are like productivity growth from any other source. When the pace of productivity growth increases, it allows for economic activity and wage growth to be robust while also being consistent with price stability.\nThe importance of business startups to our dual mandate objectives is why I have watched closely as various measures of new business formation have surged since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nApplications for new businesses jumped to a record pace shortly after the pandemic struck the U.S.\n13\nThe pace of applications has remained elevated above pre-pandemic norms all the way from the summer of 2020 to the most recent data, even though the pace appears to be cooling some this year.\n14\nAt first, it might have seemed like these business applications were mainly being submitted by people who lost their jobs, or perhaps by an increase in \"gig economy\" work. There was doubtless some of that going on, but research and data since then have painted a more optimistic picture.\nWhen researchers look across areas of the country, the pandemic business applications had only a weak connection with layoffs. The surge in applications persisted long after overall layoffs fell to the subdued pace we have seen since early 2021. The applications did have a strong relationship with workers voluntarily leaving their jobs. Some quitting workers may have chosen to join these new businesses as founders or early employees. And surging business applications were soon followed by new businesses hiring workers and expanding. Over the last two years of available data, new firms created 1.9 million jobs per year, a pace not seen since the eve of the Global Financial Crisis.\n15\nThe industry patterns of this surge reflect shifts in consumer and business needs resulting from the pandemic and its aftermath. For example, in large metro areas, new business creation shifted from city centers to the suburbs, perhaps because of the increase in remote work. Suddenly, people wanted to eat lunch or go to the gym closer to their home, rather than close to their downtown office. Likewise, consumer and business tastes for more online purchases, with the shipping requirements that entails, are evident in the surge of business entry in the online retail and transportation sectors. But this is not only about moving restaurants closer to workers or changing patterns of goods consumption. There was also a particularly strong entry into high-tech industries, such as data processing and hosting, as well as research and development services.\n16\nThat may have more to do with developments like artificial intelligence than with the pandemic specifically, as I discussed in a speech in Atlanta last week.\n17\nEconomists will spend years debating the various causes of the surge in business creation during and soon after the pandemic. Perhaps strong monetary and fiscal policy backstopping aggregate demand played some role, or pandemic social safety net policies, or simply the accommodative financial conditions of 2020 and 2021.\n18\nIndeed, more research is needed and will be the subject of many dissertations in the near future.\nI do think a large part of the story is ultimately a case of resourceful and determined American entrepreneurs, perhaps including some of you, responding to the tumultuous shocks of the pandemic. They, like some of you, stepped in to meet the rapidly changing needs of households and businesses. This points to a fourth way economists like to think about entrepreneurship, which is that entrepreneurship plays a big role in helping the economy adapt to change. Research suggests that entrepreneurs and the businesses they create are highly responsive to big economic shocks, and the COVID-19 pandemic was certainly a seismic shock.\n19\nTo be sure, the future is uncertain. It is unclear what the productivity effects of the pandemic surge of new businesses, particularly in high tech, will be.\n20\nAnd whether that surge will continue is an open question; after all, the pre-pandemic period was a period of declining rates of new business creation, and the pandemic surge itself does appear to be cooling off recently.\n21\nConclusion\nFor now, let me say that I am grateful that entrepreneurs continue to give us a hand in meeting our employment mandate, and whatever productivity gains we may reap in coming years as a result may help ease tradeoffs with inflation as well.\nFinally, I will share one last story about why South Carolina will always hold a special place in my and my sisters' hearts. Every summer and at Thanksgiving, we would travel through the Palmetto State to our grandparents' house in Winston-Salem. Sitting in the back seat of the station wagon, we were entranced by the many colorful signs along Interstate 95 advertising what I, as a child, viewed as South Carolina's number one attraction: the South of the Border roadside amusement park. We begged our parents to stop every time. It was an epic struggle that went on for more than a decade. Once or twice they did relent, a sweet childhood victory! And here is the funny thing about travels\u00e2\u0080\u0094paths can cross. The timing is such that my sisters ",

Jefferson\nAt the Charlotte Economics Club, Charlotte, North Carolina\nShare\nThank you, Steve, for that kind introduction and for the opportunity to talk to this group today.\n1\nLet me start by saying that I am saddened by the tragic loss of life, destruction, and damage resulting from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, and throughout this region. My thoughts are with the people and communities affected. For our part, the Federal Reserve and other federal and state financial regulatory agencies are working with banks and credit unions in the affected area to help make sure they can continue to meet the financial services needs of their communities.\nYesterday I shared my historical perspective on the discount window at Davidson College.\n2\nIn 1913, when the Federal Reserve was established, the discount window was the main tool it used to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system. More than 110 years later, the discount window continues to play an important role in supporting the liquidity and stability of the banking system, and the effective implementation of monetary policy.\nToday I would like to discuss with you how the discount window has evolved in the 21st century, including recent steps the Federal Reserve Board has taken to solicit feedback from the public on discount window operations. Before I address our most recent efforts, however, I will review some important episodes in discount window history that brought us to where we are today.\nFirst, I will recount briefly events in the 1980s and early 1990s that provide important context for the reappraisal of the discount window in the early 2000s. Second, I will summarize revisions to the discount window that the Fed made in 2003 and some additional changes made since then. Third, I will describe efforts that the Fed has taken to ensure that the discount window remains effective today, including the request for information that the Board recently issued on operational aspects of the discount window and intraday credit. After completing my discussion of the discount window, I will conclude with my outlook for the U.S. economy.\nEvents before the 2003 Discount Window Revisions\nI would like to pick up today where I left off yesterday in my speech at Davidson College: the 1980s and early 1990s. This was a period of widespread problems in the commercial banking sector. Troubled institutions borrowed from the discount window for extended periods of time as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) sought to find merger partners or otherwise manage the closure of these institutions. As a result, the discount window became associated strongly with lending to troubled institutions. Healthy banks' reluctance to borrow from the discount window increased. The greater reluctance to borrow from the discount window made it less effective both as a monetary policy tool and as a crisis-fighting tool.\n3\nThis led to a reassessment of the discount window in the early 2000s and to eventual revisions implemented in 2003.\nA Reassessment of the Discount Window in the Early 2000s\nThe key challenge in the reassessment of the discount window was to establish a lending program that would not only operate effectively and support monetary policy implementation, but also mitigate moral hazard and provide sufficient controls to minimize risk to Reserve Banks and, ultimately, to American taxpayers. After the reassessment, the Fed implemented several changes aimed to achieve the right balance.\nThe Board replaced the adjustment credit program, which was extended at a below-market rate, with a new type of discount window credit called primary credit. This new type of discount window credit became effective in 2003.\n4\nIt is available as a backup source of liquidity to depository institutions in generally sound financial condition at an above-market rate. Making the discount rate a penalty rate is more consistent with the long-standing practice of other major central banks. This feature was intended to reduce the need for administrative pressures based on Reserve Bank staff judgment of inappropriate usage when the discount rate was below market rates. Although those measures effectively limited usage that was deemed inappropriate at the time, they also presented communication challenges regarding when it was appropriate to use the discount window and perpetuated the perception that the Fed discouraged its use.\nPrimary credit is a \"no questions asked\" facility in which eligible depository institutions are no longer required to have exhausted other sources of funding or be subject to restrictions on the use of the borrowed funds. The Fed initially set the primary credit rate 100 basis points above the target federal funds rate.\n5\nSince March 2020, the Fed has set the primary credit rate at a level equal to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate.\n6\nAt the same time primary credit was established, another new program, called secondary credit, replaced the extended credit program. Secondary credit is available to depository institutions that are not eligible for primary credit. It was initially available at an interest rate 50 basis points higher than the primary credit rate, which is the spread in effect today. In contrast to primary credit, extensions under secondary credit are subject to higher collateral discounts and may involve ongoing oversight on the use of funds obtained under the program, reflecting the less-sound condition of secondary credit borrowers. Typically, Reserve Banks review a depository institution's plan to repay the loan and return to market sources of funding.\nThis two-tiered structure of providing the no-questions-asked primary credit program for healthy depository institutions and the secondary credit program for less-than-healthy depository institutions was designed primarily to instill public confidence in the health of institutions borrowing from the primary credit program and to reduce the reluctance of healthy depository institutions to borrow.\n7\nIn addition, having two separate facilities would reinforce the notion that healthy and troubled depository institutions alike should regard borrowing from the Fed as an option in the event of a need for additional funds.\nIn the early years of the switch to the new facilities, there were signs that healthy depository institutions became more willing to borrow from the discount window. For example, some research found that after the 2003 discount window revisions, banks borrowed more from the discount window when the federal funds rate spiked than they had previously.\n8\nThis finding suggests that the redesign of the discount window was effective in reducing banks' reluctance to borrow. As a result, the discount window may have been more effective in placing a ceiling on short-term funding rates, aiding the implementation of monetary policy, and serving as a liquidity tool when needed.\nNevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that it is difficult to measure reluctance to borrow from the discount window. When the interest rate on primary credit is above the target federal funds rate and the federal funds rate is close to its target, the aggregate volume of primary credit is expected to be low. In other words, a low average level of discount window borrowing does not necessarily mean that there is a reluctance to borrow; instead, it could simply reflect a situation in which depository institutions do not currently need to borrow. In addition, when there is an abundance of liquidity in the banking system, as is the case in the current ample-reserves monetary policy regime, depository institutions may have less need to obtain additional liquidity via the discount window. Again, this does not necessarily mean that there is a reluctance to borrow. Conversely, the presence of discount window borrowing does not necessarily reflect the absence of a reluctance to borrow. It could be the case that, although aggregate usage increases, there are still some depository institutions that are willing to pay well above the primary credit rate even when they could have borrowed readily from the discount window. For these reasons, it is important that we complement data with market outreach information to assess the effectiveness of the discount window.\nChanges and Challenges since the Introduction of Primary and Secondary Credit\nPrimary and secondary credit exist today, but some changes have been made to primary credit since its inception. For example, although the discount window was used extensively and played an important role in the emergency measures taken during the financial crisis of 2007\u00e2\u0080\u009309, some depository institutions during this period still were willing to borrow funds from the market at rates above the discount rate.\n9\nThis suggested that there was a reluctance to borrow before the crisis, and that reluctance appeared to grow over the course of the crisis. To promote the restoration of orderly conditions in financial markets and provide depository institutions with greater assurance about the cost and availability of funding, the Board approved temporary changes to its primary credit discount window facility during the crisis.\n10\nIn addition, in late 2007, the Board established the Term Auction Facility (TAF).\n11\nConcerns about lending to troubled depository institutions reemerged after the 2007\u00e2\u0080\u009309 financial crisis. In the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was enacted in 2010, Congress required the Fed to publish detailed individual institution borrowing data with a two-year lag.\n12\nThis action was intended to enhance the transparency and accountability of Federal Reserve lending while still preserving a measure of confidentiality to avoid discouraging depository institutions from borrowing.\nMore recently, in March 2020, the Fed announced changes to the provision of primary credit that were intended to encourage depository institutions to use the discount window to meet demands for credit from households and businesses in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes included setting the primary credit rate at a level equal to the top of the federal funds target range\u00e2\u0080\u0094a step that enhanced the ability of the discount window to support trading within the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) target range for the federal funds rate\u00e2\u0080\u0094and communicating the terms of borrowing as 90 days, prepayable and renewable on a daily basis. To further encourage depository institutions to use the discount window, the Fed also made changes to its reporting of Reserve Bank\u00e2\u0080\u0093level aggregate weekly discount window borrowing. It consolidated amounts previously reported as \"loans,\" which include discount window borrowing, into a broader category of assets.\n13\nThe changes made in 2020 remain in effect.\nDuring and after the spring 2023 stress events, the discount window again played an important role in supporting both monetary policy and financial stability. Depository institutions that came under severe stress turned to the discount window. The discount window also served an important role in providing ready access to funding, especially for depository institutions experiencing spillovers from the bank failures. To further ensure that depository institutions had the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors, the Board announced the creation of a new emergency program, the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). Although the BTFP was established pursuant to the Board's emergency lending authority in section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the BTFP used the discount window infrastructure to lend to eligible depository institution borrowers.\n14\nBy relying on the existing discount window infrastructure, the BTFP was able to begin operating right away. The program ceased extending new loans on March 11, 2024, as scheduled.\nToday the discount window continues to be an effective tool, but it is important to acknowledge that economic and banking conditions continue to evolve. Since the 2003 discount window reassessment, we have seen an increased focus on liquidity in banking regulation, including the advent of quantitative liquidity requirements for large banking organizations; technological changes in the banking system; a general trend toward faster and 24-7-365 payment systems; changes in the composition and posture of Federal Home Loan Bank lending; and the move to an ample-reserves monetary policy implementation regime.\nIn light of these developments, the Federal Reserve System has taken important steps to ensure that the discount window performs its functions successfully in the 21st-century economy. For example, last year the Board, along with the other federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration, issued guidance on contingency funding plans that encouraged depository institutions to be ready to borrow from the discount window.\n15\nThis includes taking steps to establish borrowing relationships with the Federal Reserve, such as providing certain legal documentation and ensuring that collateral to secure loans is ready to pledge. In connection with interagency initiatives, Reserve Banks have conducted outreach to depository institutions and made efforts to guide them in using the discount window.\nData suggest that this encouragement is working. By the end of 2023, 3,900 banks, or roughly 80 percent of all banks, had completed the legal documentation required to borrow from the discount window.\n16\nOf those, nearly 2,000 banks had pledged collateral, with an aggregate lendable value of over $2.6 trillion after applying appropriate discounts. These figures are notably above their levels at the end of 2021 and 2022. Although I am pleased to see the improvements in discount window readiness statistics, continued outreach is still important. To that effect, this summer, Federal Reserve Banks hosted an Ask the Fed\u00ae session to discuss the purpose of the discount window, its facilities, and recommendations for depository institutions on how to prepare to borrow from the Fed.\n17\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserve System has made important investments to enhance the technology that supports discount window activities. Earlier this year, the System launched Discount Window Direct, which is an online portal for depository institutions to request and prepay loans as well as securely message their local Reserve Bank.\n18\nDiscount Window Direct generally is accessible 24 hours a day. We are actively encouraging the use of Discount Window Direct.\nSeeking Feedback on the Discount Window\nTo complement our efforts to enhance discount window operations, the Federal Reserve Board recently annou",

Jefferson\nAt Davidson College, Davidson, North Carolina\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, President Hicks and Tara Boehmler, for the kind introduction.\n1\nLet me start by saying that I am saddened by the tragic loss of life, destruction, and damage resulting from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, and throughout this region. My thoughts are with the people and communities affected, including those in the Davidson College family. For our part, the Federal Reserve and other federal and state financial regulatory agencies are working with banks and credit unions in the affected area to help make sure they can continue to meet the financial services needs of their communities.\nI am happy to be back at Davidson College. This is a special community. I am bound to it by a shared experience defined not by its length, but by its intensity. As I visited with you today, and as I look around this hall, I see the faces of colleagues who became dear friends during the COVID-19 pandemic. Back then, we spoke often about the unprecedented uncertainty we faced. Amidst that uncertainty, however, we supported each other on this campus. Now, looking back, we can attest that this mutual support was vital. I am grateful to have been amongst you during that unprecedented time. Today, I am proud to see that Davidson is stronger than ever.\nI am excited to be here with you this evening and to talk to you about the history of the Federal Reserve's discount window.\n2\nThe discount window is one of the tools the Fed uses to support the liquidity and stability of the banking system, and to implement monetary policy effectively. It was created in 1913 when the Fed was established. Today, more than 110 years later, this tool continues to play an important role. At the Fed, we always look for ways to improve our tools, including our discount window operations. Recently, the Fed published a request for information document to receive feedback from the public regarding operational aspects of the discount window and intraday credit.\n3\nToday, I will do three things. First, I will discuss briefly my outlook for the U.S. economy. Second, I will offer my historical perspective on the discount window, starting in 1913 and ending in 2000. Finally, I will provide a few details about the request for information the Fed recently published.\nTomorrow, I will say more about the discount window when I speak at the Charlotte Economics Club.\nEconomic Outlook and Considerations for Monetary Policy\nEconomic activity continues to grow at a solid pace. Inflation has eased substantially. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state.\nSlide 1\nSlide 2\nAs you can see in\nslide 3\n, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, well down from 6.5 percent two years earlier. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent, compared with 5.2 percent two years earlier. Our restrictive monetary policy stance played a role in restraining demand and in keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of inflation surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets. Inflation is now much closer to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent objective. I expect that we will continue to make progress toward that goal.\nWhile, overall, the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, the labor market has modestly cooled. Employers added an average of 186,000 jobs per month during July through September, a slower pace than seen early this year. A shown in\nslide 4\n, the unemployment rate now stands at 4.1 percent, up from 3.8 percent in September 2023. Meanwhile, job openings declined by about 4 million since their peak in March 2022. The good news is that the rise in unemployment has been limited and gradual, and the level of unemployment remains historically low. Even so, the cooling in the labor market is noticeable.\nCongress mandated the Fed to pursue maximum employment and price stability. The balance of risks to our two mandates has changed\u00e2\u0080\u0094as risks to inflation have diminished and risks to employment have risen, these risks have been brought roughly into balance. The FOMC has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal. To maintain the strength of the labor market, my FOMC colleagues and I recalibrated our policy stance last month, lowering our policy interest rate by 1/2 percentage point, as shown in\nslide 5\n.\nLooking ahead, I will carefully watch incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks when considering additional adjustments to the federal funds target range, our primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy. My approach to monetary policymaking is to make decisions meeting by meeting. As the economy evolves, I will continue to update my thinking about policy to best promote maximum employment and price stability.\nDiscount Window History\n1913: The Fed was established\nNow, I will turn to my perspective on the history of the discount window. Understanding this history is important as we consider ways to ensure the discount window continues to serve effectively in its critical role of providing liquidity to the banking system as the economy and financial system evolve.\nBefore the Federal Reserve was founded, the U.S. experienced frequent financial panics. One example is illustrated in\nslide 6\nwith a newspaper clipping from the Rocky Mountain Times printed on July 19, 1893. It depicts panic swirling against banks at a time when bank runs swept through midwestern and western cities such as Chicago, Denver, and Los Angeles. The illustration shows how waves of panic hit public confidence, the rocks in the picture, and how banks have a fortress mentality. They stand strong against the panic, but they are not lending, and they are isolated.\nBack then, the supply of money to the economy was inelastic in the short term, in part because the monetary system in the U.S. was based on the gold standard. Demand for cash, however, varied over the course of the year and was particularly strong during harvest season, when crops were brought to the market. The surge in demand for cash, combined with the inelastic supply of money in the short term, caused financial conditions to tighten seasonally. The banking system was fairly good at moving money to where it needed to go, but it had little scope to expand the total amount of money available in response to the U.S. economy's needs. So if a shock hit the economy when financial conditions were already tight, then the banking system struggled to provide the extra liquidity needed. Banks would seek to preserve liquidity by reducing their investments and denying loan requests, for example. Depositors, fearful that they might not be able to access their funds when they needed them, would rush to withdraw their money. Of course, that caused the banks to conserve further on liquidity. In some cases, they simply closed their doors until the storm passed. When banks closed their doors, economic activity would contract.\n4\nActivity would recover when the banks reopened, but the economic suffering in the meantime was meaningful.\nIn addition to the supply of money in the economy being inelastic in the short term, two prominent frictions, asymmetric information and externalities, made banks and private markets vulnerable to systemic crises. Here, asymmetric information refers to the fact that customers do not have access to all the information they need to evaluate whether a bank is insolvent, illiquid, or both.\n5\nTherefore, customers rely on imperfect signals, such as news reports about another bank failing, to decide whether to withdraw their money from their own bank.\nThen there are externalities, in the sense that an individual bank may not consider how an innocent bystander may be negatively impacted by its actions. When a financial institution fails, that may lead depositors to withdraw money from other unrelated banks, which may in turn cause those banks to fail. Contagion can transform a single bank failure into a systemic crisis, where many banks fail, credit evaporates, the stock market collapses, the economy enters a recession, and the unemployment rate increases dramatically.\nThe severe financial panic of 1907 stands out as an example of market failure due to these two prominent frictions. The panic was triggered by a series of bad banking decisions that led to a frenzy of withdrawals caused by asymmetric information and public distrust in the liquidity of the banking system.\n6\nBanks in many large cities, including financial centers such as New York and Chicago, simply stopped sending payments outside of their communities. The resulting disruption in the payment system and to the flow of liquidity through the banking system led to a severe, though short-lived, economic contraction. This experience led Congress to pass the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.\n7\nThis act created the Federal Reserve System, composed of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C., and 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the country.\n8\nIn 1913, the main monetary policy tool at the Fed's disposal was the discount window. At that time, the Fed did not use open market operations\u00e2\u0080\u0094the buying and selling of government securities in the open market\u00e2\u0080\u0094to conduct monetary policy. Instead, the Fed adjusted the money supply by lending directly to banks that needed funds through the discount window. The Fed's ability to provide funds to banks as needed made the money supply of the U.S. more elastic and considerably reduced the seasonal volatility in interest rates.\n9\nThis ability also enabled the Fed to provide stability in times of stress, helping banks that experienced rapid withdrawals to satisfy their customers' demand for liquidity and thereby potentially preventing banking panics.\n1920s: The Fed began to discourage strongly use of the discount window\nIn fact, many researchers have argued that the existence of the Fed's discount window prevented a financial crisis in the early 1920s, when the banking sector came under pressure as the U.S. economy transitioned to a peacetime economy following the end of World War I.\n10\nThere had been an agricultural boom during the war and a significant accumulation of debt within that sector. Farmers came under pressure as the prices of agricultural goods dropped from wartime highs. The banks sought to support their customers, and the Fed sought to support the banks. There were serious concerns about the condition of several banks in parts of the country. The Fed's discount window lending provided critical support that saved many banks but also resulted in habitual use of the discount window by some banks during the 1920s.\n11\nSlide 7\nshows that as of August 1925, 593 member banks, 6 percent of the total, had been borrowing for a year or more from Federal Reserve Banks. Moreover, there were real solvency problems, and several banks failed with discount window loans outstanding. These challenges resulted in the Fed strongly discouraging banks from continuous borrowing from the discount window and the adoption of a policy of encouraging a \"reluctance to borrow.\"\n12\nBy 1926, the Fed was explicit that borrowing at the discount window was meant to be short term. As I emphasize in\nslide 8\n, the Federal Reserve's annual report for 1926 stated that while continuous borrowing by a member bank may be necessary, depending on local economic conditions, \"the funds of the Federal reserve banks are primarily intended to be used in meeting the seasonal and temporary requirements of members, and continuous borrowing by a member bank as a general practice would not be consistent with the intent of the Federal reserve act.\"\n13\nThe late 1920s also highlighted Fed concerns about the purpose of the borrowing. The Fed sought to distinguish between \"speculative security loans\" and loans for \"legitimate business.\"\n14\nA staff reappraisal of the discount mechanism stated that \"[t]he controversy over direct pressure intensified in the latter part of the 1920s as an increasing flow of bank credit went into the stock market.\"\n15\nIn short, the Fed observed that some banks were becoming habitual borrowers from the discount window. It was concerned that an overreliance on discount window borrowings would weaken banks and make them more prone to failure.\nIn the late 1920s, the Fed switched to open market operations as its primary tool for conducting monetary policy.\n16\nThat allowed the Fed to determine the aggregate amount of liquidity in the system and to rely on private financial markets to distribute it efficiently. The discount window would thus serve as a safety valve if there was a shock that caused conditions to tighten unexpectedly or if individual banks experienced idiosyncratic shocks or somehow lost access to interbank markets.\nThe intention of this set-up was for banks to use the discount window to borrow from the Fed only occasionally. Ordinarily and predominantly, financial institutions were supposed to rely on private markets for their funding. This set-up was designed to limit moral hazard\u00e2\u0080\u0094the possibility that institutions take unnecessary risks when there is no market discipline. This is the key balancing act. The Fed needs to be a reliable backstop to prevent financial crises, but it also needs to minimize moral hazard that comes from always standing ready to provide support.\n1930s\u00e2\u0080\u00931940s: The Great Depression and WWII\nDuring the Great Depression in the 1930s, the banking system experienced severe stress, including many bank runs. There are many reasons why the discount window was insufficient to address the problems in the banking system in the 1930s. I will highlight only two. First, many banks were insolvent rather than illiquid. Central bank lending is not a fundamental solution in those circumstances. When banks are insolvent, it is important to manage the closure in as orderly a manner as possible. The establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1933 gave bank regulators increased ability to do that. Relatedly, the challenging experiences of lending to troubled banks in the 1920s likely made the Fed more reluctant to lend in circumstances in which solvency concerns were material. Second, the types of collateral that the Fed was initially able to accept when lending to banks were quite limited.\nIn response, in the early 1930s Congress expanded the range of banking assets that could serve as collateral for discount window loans and added a variety of new Fed emergency lending authorities.\n17\nThese new lending authorities were used i",

Kugler\nAt the Conference on Monetary Policy 2024: Bridging Science and Practice, European Central Bank, Frankfurt, Germany\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Isabel, and thank you for the opportunity to speak here at the ECB today.\n1\nI am particularly pleased to be part of this year's conference because the theme you have chosen has, for some time now, also been a theme of my career as an academic and public servant. Every day, of course, central bankers must bridge science and practice, drawing on the insights that research provides, specifically, because the economy and the world are continuously subject to new circumstances. We must do so, and put those insights into practice, because everyone in the United States, and in Europe, and around the world, depends on a healthy and growing economy, and depends on policymakers making the right decisions to help keep it that way.\n*\nBut well before I came to the Federal Reserve, I was also bridging science and practice. First, as a labor economist, when, for example, I was exploring how employment, productivity, and earnings are influenced not only by educational attainment and experience, but also by policies. Later, as chief economist at the Department of Labor, I brought science to bear in carrying out its mission of supporting workers. As the U.S. representative at the World Bank, economic science was likewise crucial in deciding how to best direct the institution's resources to where they were needed the most. In each of these roles, I have learned a bit more about the need to balance rigorous scientific understanding of the problems that people face with the real-world experiences of those people, which sometimes do not fit so neatly into an economic theorem or principle.\nMost recently, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have been focused on the very practical task of reducing inflation while keeping employment at its maximum level. To understand the recent experience of high inflation in the United States, it is helpful to consider how inflation behaved around the world after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the remainder of my remarks, I will discuss the global dimensions of the recent bout of high inflation in different economies, both comparing similarities and contrasting differences, with a special emphasis on the factors that enabled the United States to achieve disinflation while having stronger economic activity relative to its peers. I will then conclude with some comments on the U.S. economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy.\nStarting with the similarities in our inflationary experiences, in early 2020, a worldwide pandemic disrupted the global economy and ultimately caused a surge of inflation around the world. Global goods production was hobbled, transportation and other aspects of supply chains became entangled, and there were significant labor shortages, all combining to cause a severe imbalance between supply and demand in much of the world. Sharp increases in commodity prices were exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The result was a global escalation of inflation. As you can see by the black line on\nslide 2\n, a measure of world headline inflation in 26 economies accounting for 60 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) rose to a degree that had not been experienced since the early 1980s.\nThis worldwide increase of inflation was synchronized and widespread across advanced and emerging economies. To measure the synchronization and breadth of this inflationary period, Federal Reserve Board researchers have employed a dynamic factor model to estimate a common component of inflation across these 26 economies.\n2\nAs you can see by the blue line on slide 2, the estimated global component accounts for a large share of the variation of headline inflation among these economies after inflation began rising sharply in 2021. This evidence is consistent with the familiar story of widespread lockdowns, shutdowns of manufacturing plants in different parts of the world, disrupted logistic networks, increases in shipping costs, and longer delivery times. In the recovery, we also saw globally higher demand for commodities, intermediate inputs, and final goods and services, with demand exceeding a still-constrained supply.\nIndeed, one important contributor to the recent co-movement in inflation across the world has been food and energy prices. As you know, most of the time variations in inflation are heavily influenced by food and energy prices, which tend to be more volatile than the prices for other goods and services. Because many food and energy commodities are traded internationally, retail prices paid by consumers also tend to have some degree of global synchronization. Thus, as you would expect, the black line in the left chart on\nslide 3\nshows that food and energy inflation faced by consumers around the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094here called noncore inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094rose substantially in the recent inflationary episode. Moreover, world noncore inflation is largely accounted for by its global component in yellow, thus also showing a high degree of global synchronization.\nAnother thing we can say about the recent worldwide escalation of inflation is how widely diffused it was across different price categories. Core inflation excludes food and energy prices, and it includes many categories more exposed to domestic conditions such as housing and medical services. Yet, as shown by the black and red lines in the right chart on slide 3, the recent rise in core inflation showed a high degree of global synchronization, with the global component accounting for a large share of the post-pandemic inflation. Looking back in history, this is the first time since the 1970s that we saw a rise in core inflation so widespread across such a large number of countries. Moreover, underlying this rise in core inflation in the United States and other advanced economies, research carried out by Federal Reserve Board economists shows that there was a widespread rise in prices across the whole range of categories within the core basket.\n3\nAcademics and policymakers have debated about the possible reasons explaining the recent co-movement of inflation around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic was a global phenomenon and had effects on supply and demand that were similar in many countries. On the supply side, businesses closed, affecting goods production and the provision of services. There were labor shortages due to illness, social distancing, early retirements, and declines in immigration, with all of these factors making it harder to produce goods and services.\n4\nProduction disruptions and labor shortages propagated around the world due to long and intricate supply chains forged over several decades of growing globalization in trade. The imbalance between supply and demand widened as consumers switched their spending from services to goods, straining transportation capacity that further disrupted supply chains.\n5\nThis re-allocation of demand from services to goods also strained the ability of firms to produce, as they struggled to find qualified workers due to the needed re-allocation of workers across sectors.\n6\nThis demand was also likely fueled by the fiscal response to COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021. All of these factors drove up costs, and there were others. Russia's war on Ukraine intensified the increases in energy and food commodity prices during the recovery from the pandemic. And the interaction of these different forces also likely played a role.\n7\nFor example, as Asia increased production to meet higher demand for goods in the U.S., this may have driven up wages and other input costs in Asia, increasing demand for imports from other places and, in turn, raising costs there, and so on. My assessment is that both supply and demand contributed to the recent global inflationary episode, including in the United States, with international trade of goods, including commodities, and services playing an important role in disseminating these forces around the world.\nOne salient aspect of past inflationary episodes is the observation that core inflation typically falls more slowly than it increases. As we can see by the red lines on\nslide 4\n, world core inflation rose more quickly than it decreased in the three most recent episodes of significant inflation and disinflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094from a trough in 1972 to a new trough in 1978; from 1978 to a trough in 1986; and then the recent episode, from the end of 2020 through the first quarter of 2024. In these episodes, the escalation of four-quarter core inflation increased by an average of 7/10 percentage point per quarter to its peak, while it decreased by an average of only 3/10 percentage point per quarter to the trough.\n8\nStill, it is important that central bankers not only compare similarities across economies in the recent inflation fight, but also contrast the differences. Notably, another important feature of the last three inflation and disinflation periods is that though the share of core inflation explained by the common component increases when inflation rises, this share decreases when inflation falls, as can be seen by the black shaded areas of the three panels on slide 4. This suggests that while the reasons underlying the co-movement of inflation across the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as global supply disruptions and commodity price shocks\u00e2\u0080\u0094may have been important when prices were increasing, they have been less important when prices have decreased. This evidence indicates that factors that vary from economy to economy become more relevant in the disinflationary period.\nEconomic researchers have raised several possible explanations for the different inflation trajectories experienced by different economies during this post-pandemic period. For example, some point to differences in the magnitudes of the demand and supply imbalances driven by the shutdown and reopening of each economy, with this imbalance possibly playing a larger role on inflation in the euro area relative to the United States.\n9\nWhile noting that differences in the size of fiscal stimulus in different countries were likely important, the targeting of that stimulus also differed, in some cases with a greater emphasis on addressing supply disruptions.\n10\nGlobal factors also affect various economies differently, with studies showing that the exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices are an important issue.\n11\nFor instance, Europe was heavily affected by natural gas shortages related to Russia's war on Ukraine, while gas supplies in the United States were more plentiful during this period. Also, supply chains were untangled at different speeds in different parts of the world, with, for instance, low water levels in the Panama Canal and attacks in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels affecting different shipping routes differently around the world. And, last but not least, differences in labor market tightness very likely played a role, with evidence pointing to its importance in the United States in driving up nominal wage growth, a factor that likely helped keep employment and economic activity at healthy levels.\n12\nResearchers at the Board of Governors also find that differences in the pace of disinflation across countries have been largely driven by different trajectories of services price inflation.\n13\nAs shown on\nslide 5\n, they find that the dispersion of inflation across countries peaked in 2023 and has been declining since then for headline and core goods, but not so much for core services inflation, with housing developments helping to account for the differences in services inflation. Other cross-country research suggests that wage developments help explain services inflation dynamics.\n14\nIndeed, services inflation from both the United States and the euro area have been elevated. Still, while U.S. housing services inflation has been running higher than the wage-driven nonhousing component, the reverse is true in the euro area.\nWhile the cross-country differences during the recent bout of high inflation have emerged more prominently during the disinflationary period, economic growth has been very heterogenous since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Generally speaking, the U.S. has experienced a significantly stronger recovery than other advanced economies. As we can see in the left panel on\nslide 6\n, real GDP has grown substantially more in the United States since 2021. This is also the case with respect to the larger components of GDP, such as consumption and investment, shown in the right two panels.\nIn explaining why the U.S. has managed to bring down inflation and experience strong economic activity, I believe that the combination of restrictive monetary policy together with convex supply curves can help explain these developments.\n15\nIn addition, there are three supply-related factors that have also made significant contributions to the combination of rapid disinflation together with continued and resilient growth.\nFirst, there are important factors that have affected total factor productivity differently across countries. For instance, the U.S. has seen greater business dynamism, as reflected in a higher rate of new business formation, shown in the left panel on\nslide 7\n. This is important because while most new firms fail, a small share of those that survive grow rapidly and make significant contributions to aggregate productivity.\n16\nMoreover, the pandemic-era business creation surge has been particularly strong in high-tech sectors, such as computer systems design as well as research and development services.\n17\nIn fact, we have also seen greater growth in total factor productivity in the U.S. relative to other advanced economies, as shown in the right figure on slide 7. In addition, while the artificial intelligence (AI) technology is still in its nascency, U.S. businesses across different sectors of the economy are investing in and adopting AI. According to the Business Trends and Outlook Survey of the Census, more than 20 percent of companies in 15 sectors have adopted AI.\n18\nIt may be too early to tell, but additional productivity gains may be coming from tasks that are enhanced by AI through process improvements.\n19\nSecond, we have seen a stronger rate of labor productivity growth in the United States as shown in the left panel on\nslide 8\n.\n20\nThe economic policy response to the pandemic in the U.S. was robust, but it was different from the response in many other advanced economies. In other economies, the emphasis was on maintaining employment, and specifically keeping workers employed in their existing firms when the pandemic arrived. This was the case, for example, in the euro area, and the middle panel",

Bowman\nAt the 2024 Community Banking Research Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve System, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri\nShare\nWatch Live\nIt is an honor to return to St. Louis for the 12th year of the Community Banking Research Conference.\n1\nThis conference is a model of effective partnership between the Federal Reserve and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, and more recently, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It is an opportunity for us all to dig deeper into the community banking model and the important role of community banks now and into the future. Together, regulators work to ensure that the approach to supervision and regulation is fit for purpose, and that each element of both supervision and regulation acts in a complementary manner. Policy disagreements are a healthy part of the process, but we must also strive to build consensus where we can. At a minimum, we must understand and respect our counterparts' and colleagues' viewpoints. Ultimately, we all share the same goal of promoting a safe and sound banking system.\nThe strength of the U.S. banking system relies upon the diversity of its institutions, and facilitating an environment that allows each category of bank to thrive is essential to fostering a healthy financial system. For community banks, this includes building a framework that better supports the unique characteristics of these institutions. Today, my remarks will consider three foundational questions as we contemplate revising the community banking framework: (1) Given the continued evolution of the banking system, how should a community bank be defined? (2) Are we pursuing the most appropriate approach to supervision and regulation of community banks, and finally, (3) How can we build a policy framework that better supports and anticipates this evolution of the banking system now and into the future?\nHow to Define a Community Bank\nBy necessity, regulators divide banks into more manageable categories. The Federal Reserve has distinct portfolios that oversee \"community,\" \"regional,\" and four \"categories\" of larger banks.\n2\nThe Federal Reserve and federal banking agencies further subdivide these portfolios based on additional factors. They may also depart from this framework altogether to group banks across portfolios or based on other common features.\nThis approach to separating bank supervisory portfolios can enable us to more clearly articulate the tailoring applied to specific requirements of supervision and regulation.\n3\nThis approach has its virtues, including allowing examiners to better organize supervisory activities and training in different portfolios to focus on issues that are most relevant for the institutions being examined. When appropriately executed, it can lead to better and more risk-focused supervision, which ultimately promotes a safer and more sound banking system.\nOf course, there are limits to this framework. And we should continue to ask if the metrics and thresholds established through regulation, and more often recently through supervisory policy decisions, are appropriate over time as conditions change.\nLocking regulatory standards into a fixed asset-size threshold has its costs. Over time, these fixed thresholds fail to take into account growth attributable to broader economic growth and inflation. They are also not reflective of any changes in a particular bank's activities or risk profile. As a result, many firms that are stable in their growth, business model, and risk profile end up unintentionally crossing regulatory thresholds. As they approach, and certainly once they cross over these asset-size lines, they must comply with additional regulatory and supervisory requirements that were specifically designed and implemented for larger and more complex firms.\nWhile the fixed-threshold approach benefits from simplicity, it is necessary to periodically revisit the policy effect of these bright-line thresholds. There are certainly cases in which a bank with assets less than $10 billion faces risks that are disproportionate to its asset size, warranting greater supervisory scrutiny. For these firms, asset size may vastly understate their risk profile. Often, they do not operate like traditional community banks, relying instead on nontraditional services and engaging in complex activities. Therefore, it may be appropriate for a community bank to be subject to additional oversight. This is particularly relevant when a bank has un-remediated, long-standing supervisory issues that require more supervisory monitoring and oversight. In such cases, a community bank supervisory approach is likely not sufficient or appropriate.\nAt the same time, many banks with assets over $10 billion\ndo\noperate like community banks, with a relationship-based straightforward business model, yet they are not regulated or supervised as such. Over time, the mismatch in supervisory expectations around this and other asset thresholds becomes more pronounced as economic growth and inflation effectively lower them. This results in potentially overly complex supervisory constructs for banks with a limited traditional community bank risk profile.\nIs it appropriate to impose more restrictive requirements on firms when those heightened requirements are not a deliberate policy choice based on the level of risk? Is it appropriate to treat each bank below a regulatory threshold as a traditional community bank? Historically, regulators have been willing to push more complex requirements and expectations down to smaller banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094essentially bumping them into a higher risk tier\u00e2\u0080\u0094than moving larger firms into a lower risk tier when that treatment may be more appropriate.\nOne important aspect of this definitional question involves the natural evolution of banking, specifically as it relates to innovation. The \"push down\" of regulatory and supervisory standards often applies when a bank pursues activities that fit under the broad umbrella of \"innovation.\" Innovation can be defined expansively to include engaging in bank-fintech partnerships, using (or considering using) digital ledger technology, or even providing traditional banking services to entities that touch the crypto-asset ecosystem. Innovation can present a challenging problem for both regulators and banks. If the \"cost\" of adopting innovation results in a bank's inclusion in a higher compliance tier, it may be difficult to encourage greater investment in innovation for smaller banks. Establishing appropriate regulatory thresholds does not force regulators to eliminate or purge innovation from the banking system, especially among community banks.\n4\nWhen considering building a framework to support community banks, the definition is key\u00e2\u0080\u0094which banks will be in scope? The answer lies in the bank's business model, activities, and risk profile.\nWhere we have established fixed-dollar asset thresholds, we must commit to revisit and adjust them as needed. In my view, this is a principle that extends beyond the lines defining community banks to all regulatory and supervisory thresholds. While there is need for flexibility in both directions, it is apparent that over time economic growth and inflation will result in thresholds that are inappropriately low.\nThe Supervision and Regulation of Community Banks\nEstablishing a definition for community banks leaves open the fundamental question of regulatory and supervisory approach. Before turning to that discussion, we need to take stock of supervision and regulation today. What areas of the framework require review and attention?\nThe Tradeoffs of Regulation\nRegulation can be a powerful and effective tool to promote bank safety and soundness, and U.S. financial stability. The special privileges that are granted with a banking charter\u00e2\u0080\u0094including deposit insurance and access to the discount window\u00e2\u0080\u0094all come with the responsibility and obligation to comply with the bank regulatory framework.\nA robust presence of community banks, especially those that are remote and rural, enables access to credit, banking, and payment services in underserved markets and communities. These banks support local economies by serving consumers and small- and medium-sized businesses, building an economic foundation to drive business development and growth. But community banks, like any business, face the economic reality that accompanies running a successful business. Each must manage its costs\u00e2\u0080\u0094including personnel, funding, and regulatory compliance\u00e2\u0080\u0094in light of its revenues to achieve a reasonable return on equity.\nWhen a bank's costs increase, there is, by necessity, a need to make changes if the bank hopes to maintain profitability and ultimately its survival. This usually involves either cutting costs or raising prices on banking services.\nHow do the realities of operating a business inform our current approach to regulation? The question becomes acutely relevant when regulators consider imposing new or revised regulations. Regulators should always ask (1) what problem does this new regulation solve, (2) what are costs of this approach, and (3) are there alternative approaches? Before discussing the path forward, I would like to note an example that highlights this concern.\nThe final Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) regulations issued in 2023 established new regulatory thresholds defining \"small,\" \"intermediate\" and \"large\" banks, with the last category\u00e2\u0080\u0094large banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094including every bank with more than $2 billion in assets.\n5\nIn my view, this rulemaking represented a missed opportunity to rationalize the requirements of the CRA among community banks, and ignored the fundamental differences among banks with different balance sheets and business models.\n6\nAn approach that applies the same evaluation standards to a bank with $2 billion in assets as it does to a bank with $2 trillion in assets arguably represents a shortcoming in considering the fundamental differences among firms, and the disproportionate costs these standards may impose on the smallest banks.\nThe Hidden Cost of Supervision and Guidance\nWhile regulation carries with it the obligation to comply with public notice and comment procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act, regulators have far more discretion in the supervisory process, and in issuing \"guidance\" that is technically non-binding but often operates as a de facto requirement. The development and implementation of new supervisory approaches and of guidance largely escape rigorous scrutiny due to the lack of formal procedural requirements for its development. This is true even though the expectations created by guidance can be equally or more impactful to banks than rules.\nFor example, the examination process often produces supervisory findings over-emphasizing non-core and non-financial risks, highlighting issues like IT and operational risk, management, risk management, and internal controls.\n7\nThese issues have filtered down from examinations and findings at the largest banks to the smallest, raising the question of appropriateness of application for smaller firms.\nIn the supervisory process, we should guard against being distracted by less relevant issues. The prevalence of supervisory findings related to nonfinancial metrics is in part driven by the time it may take to remediate certain issues. However, we should also scrutinize whether this trend is indicative of our supervisory focus\u00e2\u0080\u0094beyond financial risk and toward non-financial risks and internal processes\u00e2\u0080\u0094and whether that shift is appropriate. We should also be aware that due to the vast diversity in business models, size, and geographic footprint among banks, we should not expect every firm to follow the same standards and must be careful to prevent forcing uniformity through \"grading on a curve.\" This risk can be exacerbated through any type of horizontal-like reviews. The supervisory findings made during the examination process inform bank ratings, which can have follow-on effects like limiting options for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity; raising the cost of liquidity; or diverting resources away from other, more important bank management priorities.\nGuidance can also impose costs on banks that are not always obvious or quantified. The purpose of guidance is to provide clarity to banks and reduce implementation uncertainty and risk. To serve this purpose, however, guidance must be clear, actionable, and account for the needs of the targeted firms, especially for community banks.\nIn 2023, the federal banking agencies published supervisory guidance addressing third-party risk management, guidance expressly applicable to community banks. As I noted at the time this guidance was issued, it included shortcomings that were known and identified, but not addressed in advance.\n8\nWhile I am pleased that the community bank implementation guide was eventually published, this recent example demonstrates that we need to ensure new guidance provides clarity to regulated firms on its own, or that we provide additional resources at the same time we publish the guidance.\nGuidance can help clarify uncertainty about the application of legal requirements or suggest how regulators may view particular activities in the supervisory process. But when guidance is unclear or ambiguous about supervisory views and expectations, it can hinder community banks' ability to clearly understand and meet them. Community bankers feel a strong obligation to review the voluminous body of guidance published by regulators, knowing that even where it does not apply to them on its face, it may be pushed down to these banks as a best practice in the future.\n9\nBank Mergers, Acquisitions, and De Novo Formations\nWhat does a healthy banking system look like? While we often espouse the virtues of a \"diverse\" banking system\u00e2\u0080\u0094one with many different sizes of institutions and the flexibility to shift in size over time\u00e2\u0080\u0094a healthy banking system includes opportunities for entry and exit\u00e2\u0080\u0094 from de novo bank formation through merger and acquisition activity.\nDe novo bank formation promotes competition and greater availability of banking services. As banks consolidate or wind down operations, new banks fill gaps in the banking system. But the significant decline in the number of de novo banks raises questions about whether this pipeline can continue to be effective, even while there is existing and unmet demand for new charters.\n10\nWhile factors other than the regulatory climate for applications may influence bank formation, the application process itself can be a significant roadblock, one that can limit the healthy formation o",

Cook\nAt \u00e2\u0080\u009cTechnology-Enabled Disruption: Implications of AI, Big Data, and Remote Work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a conference organized by the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Boston, and Richmond, Atlanta, Georgia\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, President Bostic. Let me start by saying my thoughts are with all the people of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and the other communities who have felt the force of Helene's impact. I am saddened by the tragic loss of life and widespread disruption in these regions served by the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Richmond. As Chair Powell said yesterday, we at the Fed are encouraging banks to work with customers in affected areas and we are working to support the Reserve Banks to ensure there are ample cash supplies, which can be especially important during times of power outages.\nI am always happy to be in Atlanta, in Georgia, and at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. I grew up in Georgia, and I am a proud graduate of Spelman College. Atlanta is an appropriate place to speak about today's topic, artificial intelligence (AI), as it is in the midst of large corporations and startups developing uses for AI and near so many impressive schools, including Georgia Tech, a top AI research university and where I took courses to prepare for a Ph.D. in economics. Our tech entrepreneurship and AI roundtable with Chair Powell, held at Spelman last year, is a testament to Atlanta being such a locus of activity.\nToday, I will speak to you about AI, big data, and the path ahead for productivity.\n1\nMy comments today will build upon what I offered a year ago at the NBER AI meeting in Toronto, when I emphasized the importance of business decision-making in our progress along that path.\n2\nTechnology alone will not determine the outcome.\nFuturists have dreamed of an autonomous, thinking machine throughout the modern era. Benjamin Franklin once lost a game of chess to such a machine, the \"Mechanical Turk\"; of course, there was a human chess master hidden inside. Nowadays, chess engines that beat the top players can run on your phone.\nSo, what exactly makes these machines merit the label of \"artificial intelligence\"? Information systems with AI exploit complex patterns recognized in vast unstructured data sets to mimic human creativity, problem solving, and critical thinking. Some forms of AI\u00e2\u0080\u0094prediction of customer tastes with machine learning, for example\u00e2\u0080\u0094are already employed in the business sector. Others are still emerging, especially generative AI\u00e2\u0080\u0094programs that create new text and images in response to prompts. Applications in software creation, customer service, and marketing are already with us. But the full scope of generative AI's application will be revealed slowly as firms experiment and innovate.\nThis subject bears careful research and understanding in my role as a monetary policymaker. The Federal Reserve's dual mandate is to promote maximum employment and stable prices. As I discussed in a recent speech at the Ohio State University, the spread of AI and other technologies could have an effect on both.\n3\nArtificial Intelligence Adoption on the Rise\nLet me say from the outset that there is tremendous uncertainty about AI's implications. We still do not know what the magnitude or intensity of these effects will be, which workers and firms will be most affected, how big the increase in productivity might be, or even the period over which these effects will be realized.\nWhile much is still to be learned, I see growing evidence that AI is poised to have a substantial effect on U.S. and global labor markets. As firms deploy these technologies and workers discover ways to make use of them, such developments can create the conditions for greater productivity and thus higher wage growth consistent with stable prices. And adjustments in the labor market that follow as the economy adapts to technical change can affect maximum employment.\nMy view is that AI, and generative AI in particular, is likely to become a general-purpose technology\u00e2\u0080\u0094one that spreads throughout the economy, sparks downstream innovation, and continues to improve over time. Since my speech last year, further evidence in favor of a cautiously optimistic view has accumulated. The list of tasks for which AI performance is at least equivalent to that of a skilled human continues to grow. Remarkably, one AI model reached silver-medal performance at the International Mathematical Olympiad this year.\n4\nSurvey results from the Census Bureau show that AI adoption has risen, with AI in regular use across many sectors of the economy, but is still used in only a small share of firms.\n5\nOther surveys find wider adoption. For example, a study from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found generative AI is being adopted at a faster rate than the internet and personal computers were at a comparable point after those technologies were widely introduced.\n6\nIn a sign that the prospect of more widespread use of AI is on the horizon, U.S. data center construction spending and semiconductor imports have soared in the past two years.\nExamining Productivity\nSince the high-tech boom ended in the early 2000s, smoothing through recession-driven swings, growth in output per hour worked has been relatively modest, roughly 1.5 percent per year, on average, though it has picked up some over the past two years. In fact, the latest estimate for productivity would not have looked out of place in the high-tech boom: it grew 2.7 percent over the year ending in the second quarter. The emergence of generative AI has raised hopes for a technology-fueled revival of strong growth in labor productivity, which could support rising real earnings for workers and purchasing power for households. Like many of the most significant innovations of the past few centuries\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as the steam engine, electricity, computers, and the internet\u00e2\u0080\u0094AI has the potential to affect labor productivity in a wide swath of economic activities across many industries and occupations.\nAlthough I share the view that AI could lift productivity out of this period of low growth, it bears emphasis that recent productivity gains have been modest despite rather impressive changes in information technology. For example, we live much of our lives on our smartphones, devices that almost no one used 20 years ago. Moreover, the generative AI models that have captured our attention since 2022 were preceded by other forms of AI that have already been integrated into e-commerce and other business operations. In other words, the modest productivity growth seen of late already incorporates gains from some types of AI. Whether generative AI delivers a similar, incremental contribution to productivity growth or something larger remains to be seen.\nThe degree to which AI leads to productivity improvement bears careful watching, because, if it does meaningfully lift productivity, it could help constrain unit labor costs and inflation in the long run. And, of course, measuring productivity in real time is challenging. Famously, Chairman Alan Greenspan spied productivity gains from information technology in the 1990s long before they appeared in the data.\nThe challenge for macroeconomic forecasters is that productivity does not follow immediately from invention and innovation. The translation of technology into productivity depends on the choices made by firms, workers, and policymakers. Time-consuming work at the adopting firm is often needed to tailor the technology to its specific needs.\n7\nFor example, a case study by researchers at Harvard Business School revealed that when GitHub built Copilot, a code-completion tool, on top of generative AI technology adopted from OpenAI, it went through a process of experimentation, false starts, management challenges, and substantial expense.\n8\nMoreover, while productivity growth follows from translation of clever new ideas into concrete business practices, this full effect is realized only when capital and labor are reallocated to the firms that are most adept at doing so. This \"business dynamism\" contribution to productivity dwindled in the years before the pandemic.\n9\nThe recent surge in new business creation provides some hope that dynamism may be rebounding.\nVariation between Firms\nThe push to use AI algorithms to make more decisions will entail some degree of adjustment at AI-using firms to the jobs of their employees, as well. Understandably, the prospect of those adjustments has many knowledge workers concerned about job security.\n10\nImportantly, when one considers the wide array of tasks involved in performing most jobs\u00e2\u0080\u0094some of the ones we take for granted are quite difficult to automate\u00e2\u0080\u0094it becomes harder to imagine entire positions becoming redundant.\n11\nFor example, an advertising firm might allow AI to produce suggested copy and images reflecting the identity of a client, but only after providing the AI system with notes based on meetings, observation, and experience. And the proposed advertisement could be further reviewed and revised, presented to the client, and evaluated for success by human beings.\nThis makes it likely that the bundle of tasks involved in many jobs will change, as will the share of the worker's time spent on each task. AI may field routine customer service requests and leave unusual or especially important requests to human representatives. Indeed, work by Erik Brynjolfsson, Danielle Li, and Lindsey Raymond shows that AI may accelerate the acquisition of skills for new workers by offering suggested responses based on the history of previous interactions on a given subject.\n12\nThis adjustment process entails both modifying the mix of tasks handled by retained workers and hiring new talent from outside the firm. A recent survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that very few AI-adopting firms had laid off workers as part of that process in the previous six months, and many firms have plans to retrain their workers to use AI.\n13\nAdapting an incumbent business to fully exploit AI can be a daunting task: the business may need to substantially reorganize its operations to reap the full benefit of AI.\n14\nGiven access to information from throughout the firm, AI may offer insights into business process efficiency, but the data landscape may be Balkanized, with differing standards and restrictive permissions. Reports are that one prominent technology firm addressed this problem by requiring that employees provide widespread access to all data sets within the company and service interfaces to make the access seamless.\n15\nNot all firms will find it feasible or desirable to take such sweeping measures.\nNew entrants may have an advantage in this landscape in that they have fewer entrenched practices. In a development that one may speculate is connected to AI, Ryan Decker and John Haltiwanger found that a large share of the surge in new business entry seen in the past three years has been in high tech industries.\n16\nImportantly, even in this moment of abundant startups, we may be missing the potential contributions of some groups. In my own work before joining the Federal Reserve Board, I found that investors underrate the prospects of Black-founded, or simply outsider-founded, startups in early funding stages.\n17\nAddressing better assessment in the early stages of invention and innovation could broaden the range of new entrants and the ideas they contribute.\nNonetheless, incumbent firms may be better positioned to fund the gargantuan sums required to train AI models. Leading-edge models, adaptable for a wide range of tasks, cost tens of millions of dollars to train.\n18\nBig data processing techniques\u00e2\u0080\u0094distributed computing, scalability, in-memory processing\u00e2\u0080\u0094play an important role in that training, which uses terabytes of unstructured data.\nAnd those firms have the accumulated data from their business operations with which to train AI. Some observers have noted that the finite supply of high-quality data is beginning to constrain model improvement.\n19\nApparently, central bankers are not the only ones always looking for \"more good data\"! Future gains are expected to be driven by the adaptation of AI to specific contexts using proprietary data available only within the confines of individual firms.\nConclusion\nIn closing, looking ahead, I anticipate an acceleration in productivity grounded in the impressive advances in AI, but substantial uncertainty attends that forecast. Such uncertainty arises from the nature of invention, innovation, diffusion, and adaptation of new technologies, as well as from policy decisions that will govern this process. Fostering the global innovation ecosystem remains desirable through research and development, advanced education, worker training and retraining, and legal protections for intellectual property. Moreover, a consensus needs to be forged on the benefits and costs of regulation of the use of AI in the areas of privacy, compensation for training data, perpetuation and amplification of bias, and fraud. Additionally, the ultimate outcomes could benefit from broader inclusion across demographic groups in the startup and research communities and attention to the potential effects on competition of the advantages of incumbent firms.\nIn short, AI will be translated into productivity improvements with \"long and variable lags,\" as we monetary policymakers like to say. The changes we see in the macroeconomy\u00e2\u0080\u0094aggregate output, employment, and income\u00e2\u0080\u0094are the collective effect of millions of firms, households, and government policymakers thinking through what AI means for them. You might say that, like the Mechanical Turk, ultimately the human inside the machine is still in charge.\nMy hope is that rising productivity gains will serve as a counterweight to inflation going forward. We will monitor these developments closely.\nThank you for having me here today. I look forward to your questions.\n1.

Powell\nAt the National Association for Business Economics Annual Meeting, Nashville, Tennessee\nShare\nWatch Live\nI have some brief comments on the economy and monetary policy and look forward to our discussion.\nOur economy is strong overall and has made significant progress over the past two years toward achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. Labor market conditions are solid, having cooled from their previously overheated state. Inflation has eased, and my Federal Open Market Committee colleagues and I have greater confidence that it is on a sustainable path to 2 percent. At our meeting earlier this month, we reduced the level of policy restraint by lowering the target range of the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point. That decision reflects our growing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in an environment of moderate economic growth and inflation moving sustainably down to our objective.\nRecent Economic Data\nThe labor market\nMany indicators show the labor market is solid. To mention just a few, the unemployment rate is well within the range of estimates of its natural rate. Layoffs are low. The labor force participation rate of individuals aged 25 to 54 (so-called prime age) is near its historic high, and the prime-age women's participation rate has continued to reach new all-time highs. Real wages are increasing at a solid pace, broadly in line with gains in productivity. The ratio of job openings to unemployed workers has moved down steadily but remains just above 1\u00e2\u0080\u0094so that there are still more open positions than there are people seeking work. Prior to 2019, that was rarely the case.\nStill, labor market conditions have clearly cooled over the past year. Workers now view jobs as somewhat less available than they were in 2019. The moderation in job growth and the increase in labor supply have led the unemployment rate to increase to 4.2 percent, still low by historical standards. We do not believe that we need to see further cooling in labor market conditions to achieve 2 percent inflation.\nInflation\nOver the most recent 12 months, headline and core inflation were 2.2 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively. Disinflation has been broad based, and recent data indicate further progress toward a sustained return to 2 percent. Core goods prices have fallen 0.5 percent over the past year, close to their pre-pandemic pace, as supply bottlenecks have eased. Outside of housing, core services inflation is also close to its pre-pandemic pace. Housing services inflation continues to decline, but sluggishly. The growth rate in rents charged to new tenants remains low. As long as that remains the case, housing services inflation will continue to decline.\nBroader economic conditions also set the table for further disinflation. The labor market is now roughly in balance. Longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored.\nMonetary Policy\nOver the past year, we have continued to see solid growth and healthy gains in the labor force and productivity. Our goal all along has been to restore price stability without the kind of painful rise in unemployment that has frequently accompanied efforts to bring down high inflation. That would be a highly desirable result for the communities, families, and businesses we serve. While the task is not complete, we have made a good deal of progress toward that outcome.\nFor much of the past three years, inflation ran well above our goal, and the labor market was extremely tight. Appropriately, our focus was on bringing down inflation. By keeping monetary policy restrictive, we helped restore the balance between overall supply and demand in the economy. That patient approach has paid dividends: Inflation is now much closer to our 2 percent objective. Today, we see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance.\nOur policy rate had been at a two-decade high since the July 2023 meeting. At the time of that meeting, core inflation was above 4 percent, well above our target, and unemployment was 3.5 percent, near a 50-year low. In the 14 months since, inflation has moved down, and unemployment has moved up, in both cases significantly. It was time for a recalibration of our policy stance to reflect progress toward our goals as well as the changed balance of risks.\nAs I mentioned, our decision to reduce our policy rate by 50 basis points reflects our growing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate economic growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent.\nLooking forward, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, policy will move over time toward a more neutral stance. But we are not on any preset course. The risks are two-sided, and we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. As we consider additional policy adjustments, we will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Overall, the economy is in solid shape; we intend to use our tools to keep it there.\nWe remain resolute in our commitment to our maximum-employment and price-stability mandates. Everything we do is in service to our public mission.\nThank you. I look forward to our conversation.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            September 30, 2024",

Bowman\nAt the Georgia Bankers Association President/CEO Conference, Charleston, South Carolina\nShare\nGood morning. I would like to thank the Georgia Bankers Association for the invitation to join you today for your annual conference.\n1\nI appreciate the opportunity to share my views on the U.S. economy and monetary policy before we engage on community banking issues and other matters affecting the banking industry.\nIn light of the recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I will begin my remarks by providing some perspective on my vote and will then share my current views on the economy and monetary policy.\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting\nIn order to address high inflation, for more than two years, the FOMC increased and held the federal funds rate at a restrictive level. At our September meeting, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent and to continue reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.\nAs the post-meeting statement noted, I dissented from the FOMC's decision, preferring instead to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 5 to 5\u00e2\u0080\u00911/4 percent. Last Friday, once our FOMC participant communications blackout period concluded, the Board of Governors released my statement explaining the decision to depart from the majority of the voting members. I agreed with the Committee's assessment that, given the progress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market, it was appropriate to reflect this progress by recalibrating the level of the federal funds rate and begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance of policy. As my statement notes, I preferred a smaller initial cut in the policy rate while the U.S. economy remains strong and inflation remains a concern, despite recent progress.\nEconomic Conditions and Outlook\nIn recent months, we have seen some further progress on slowing the pace of inflation, with monthly readings lower than the elevated pace seen in the first three months of the year. The 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which provides a broader perspective than the more volatile higher-frequency readings, has moved down since April, although it came in at 2.7 percent in August, again remaining well above our 2 percent goal. The persistently high core inflation largely reflects pressures on housing prices, perhaps due in part to low inventories of affordable housing. The progress in lowering inflation since April is a welcome development, but core inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee's 2 percent goal.\nPrices remain much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh on consumer sentiment. Higher prices have an outsized effect on lower- and moderate-income households, as these households devote a significantly larger share of income to food, energy, and housing. Prices for these spending categories have far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years.\nEconomic growth moderated earlier this year after coming in stronger last year. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP) growth has been solid and slowed much less than gross domestic product (GDP), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile categories including net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than GDP indicated. PDFP has continued to increase at a solid pace so far in the third quarter, despite some further weakening in housing activity, as retail sales have shown further robust gains in July and August.\nAlthough personal consumption has remained resilient, consumers appear to be pulling back on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant spending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have extra savings to support this type of spending, and we have seen loan delinquency rates normalize from historically low levels during the pandemic.\nThe most recent labor market report shows that payroll employment gains have slowed appreciably to a pace moderately above 100,000 per month over the three months ending in August. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.2 percent in August from 4.3 percent in July. While unemployment is notably higher than a year ago, it is still at a historically low level and below my and the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of full employment.\nThe labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined further to a touch below the historically elevated pre-pandemic level\u00e2\u0080\u0094a sign that the number of available workers and the number of available jobs have come into better balance. But there are still more available jobs than available workers, a condition that before 2018 has only occurred twice for a prolonged period since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength despite the reported data.\nAlthough wage growth has slowed further in recent months, it remains indicative of a tight labor market. At just under 4 percent, as measured by both the employment cost index and average hourly earnings, wage gains are still above the pace consistent with our inflation goal given trend productivity growth.\nThe rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs remain low. In addition to some cooling in labor demand, there are other factors likely contributing the increased unemployment. A mismatch between the skills of the new workers and available jobs could further raise unemployment, suggesting that higher unemployment has been partly driven by the stronger supply of workers. It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the recent rise in the unemployment rate, as unemployment among working age teenagers sharply increased in August.\nPreference for a More Measured Recalibration of Policy\nThe U.S. economy remains strong and core inflation remains uncomfortably above our 2 percent target. In light of these economic conditions, a few further considerations supported the case for a more measured approach in beginning the process to recalibrate our policy stance to remove restriction and move toward a more neutral setting.\nFirst, I was concerned that reducing the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point could be interpreted as a signal that the Committee sees some fragility or greater downside risks to the economy. In the current economic environment, with no clear signs of material weakening or fragility, in my view, beginning the rate-cutting cycle with a 1/4 percentage point move would have better reinforced the strength in economic conditions, while also confidently recognizing progress toward our goals. In my mind, a more measured approach would have avoided the risk of unintentionally signaling concerns about underlying economic conditions.\nSecond, I was also concerned that reducing the policy rate by 1/2 percentage point could have led market participants to expect that the Committee would lower the target range by that same pace at future meetings until the policy rate approaches a neutral level. If this expectation had materialized, we could have seen an unwarranted decline in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions could become overly accommodative. This outcome could work against the Committee's goal of returning inflation to our 2 percent target.\nI am pleased that Chair Powell directly addressed both of these concerns during the press conference following the most recent FOMC meeting.\nThird, there continues to be a considerable amount of pent-up demand and cash on the sidelines ready to be deployed as the path of interest rates moves down. Bringing the policy rate down too quickly carries the risk of unleashing that pent-up demand. A more measured approach would also avoid unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures.\nFinally, in dialing back our restrictive stance of policy, we also need to be mindful of what the end point is likely to be. My estimate of the neutral rate is much higher than it was before the pandemic. Therefore, I think we are much closer to neutral than would have been the case under pre-pandemic conditions, and I did not see the peak stance of policy as restrictive to the same extent that my colleagues may have. With a higher estimate of neutral, for any given pace of rate reductions, we would arrive at our destination sooner.\nOngoing Risks to the Outlook\nTurning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market continues to be near estimates of full employment. Although the labor market data have been showing signs of cooling in recent months, still-elevated wage growth, solid consumer spending, and resilient GDP growth are not consistent with a material economic weakening or fragility. My contacts also continue to mention that they are not planning layoffs and continue to have difficulty hiring. Therefore, I am taking less signal from the recent labor market data until there are clear trends indicating that both spending growth and the labor market have materially weakened. I suspect the recent immigration flows have and will continue to affect labor markets in ways that we do not yet fully understand and cannot yet accurately measure. In light of the dissonance created by conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.\nIn my view, the upside risks to inflation remain prominent. Global supply chains continue to be susceptible to labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, which could result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. Expansionary fiscal spending could also lead to inflationary risks, as could an increased demand for housing given the long-standing limited supply, especially of affordable housing. While it has not been my baseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation could continue to stall.\nAlthough it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on lowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that the Committee's larger policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate. Accomplishing our mission of returning to low and stable inflation at our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term.\nIn light of these considerations, I believe that, by moving at a measured pace toward a more neutral policy stance, we will be better positioned to achieve further progress in bringing inflation down to our 2 percent target, while closely watching the evolution of labor market conditions.\nThe Path Forward\nDespite my dissent at the most recent FOMC meeting, I respect and appreciate that my FOMC colleagues preferred to begin the reduction in the federal funds rate with a larger initial cut in the target range for the policy rate. I remain committed to working together with my colleagues to ensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our goals of attaining maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent target.\nI will continue to monitor the incoming data and information as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to adjusting the stance of policy going forward. It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. We need to ensure that the public understands clearly how current and expected deviations of inflation and employment from our mandated goals inform our policy decisions.\nBy the time of our next meeting in November, we will have received updated reports on inflation, employment, and economic activity. We may also have a better understanding of how developments in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions might influence the economic outlook.\nDuring the intermeeting period, I will continue to visit with a broad range of contacts to discuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As I noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as a concern. In light of the upside risks that I just described, it remains necessary to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate while being attentive to the risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view continues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run. However, should the data evolve in a way that points to a material weakening in the labor market, I would support taking action and adjust monetary policy as needed while taking into account our inflation mandate.\nClosing Thoughts\nIn closing, thank you again for welcoming me here today. It is a pleasure to join you and to have the opportunity to discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy. And given the recent FOMC meeting decision and my dissent, I appreciate being able to provide a more detailed explanation of the reasoning that led me to dissent in favor of a smaller reduction in the policy rate at the FOMC meeting.\nI look forward to answering your questions and to engaging with your members on bank regulatory and supervisory matters.\n1.

Cook\nAt The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio\nShare\nWatch Live\nI am grateful for the educational opportunities this university has afforded my family over the years, including my uncle Samuel DuBois Cook who received his M.A. and Ph.D. here in 1950 and 1953. I am delighted to be here! Today, I would like to discuss the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) for workers and the labor market, more generally.\n1\nI will discuss AI's potential to boost productivity, offer a framework to consider which jobs will be most affected by AI, and consider AI's effect on aggregate employment. I hope this discussion will be informative for many of you in the audience, especially those of you who will be entering the job market in the next few years. However, before discussing AI, I think it will be helpful to first set the stage by reviewing how the labor market has evolved in recent years and where it is today.\nView of the Labor Market\nOn the eve of the pandemic, the labor market was quite strong. The unemployment rate was flirting with historical lows, having fallen to 3.5 percent in the fall of 2019 from an average of 4.7 percent between 2014 and 2019. Jobs were relatively plentiful, with 12 openings for every 10 unemployed job seekers.\nThen, the labor market changed dramatically in the first few months of the pandemic when economies around the world shut down. By April 2020, nearly one out of every seven U.S. workers was unemployed. The U.S. labor market lost more than 20 million jobs in just two months. To put that into perspective, that is nearly four times the total number of jobs in Ohio. U.S. workers and employers, with the support of timely and extraordinary policy action, proved to be resilient and innovative. As we know from the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee, the pandemic recession was the shortest on record, even though it was the deepest since the Great Depression. By mid-2020, the economy was growing again.\nAnd grow it did. The labor market roared back, gaining 25 million jobs in the three years from its low point in April 2020. Demand for labor outpaced supply such that by mid-2022 there were 20 job openings for every 10 unemployed job seekers. By early 2023, the unemployment rate fell to 3.4 percent, its lowest level in 60 years.\nIn the last year and a half, labor demand has moderated, as restrictive monetary policy helped bring aggregate demand in line with supply and eased inflationary pressure. At the same time, labor supply grew rapidly, and now labor demand and supply are more balanced. While the overall labor market remains solid, it has cooled noticeably this year and is now less tight than it was on the eve of the pandemic. In August, the unemployment rate stood at 4.2 percent, having risen by almost a 1/2 percentage point over the past 12 months. And, in recent months, the number of job openings relative to unemployed job seekers has fallen to just below its pre-pandemic range.\nAs labor demand and supply are now more evenly balanced, it may become more difficult for some individuals to find employment. For example, younger workers could experience more hurdles as they look for that first job that will launch them on a longer career path. Over the past 12 months, the share of 16- to 24-year-olds in the labor force who are unemployed has risen over 1 percentage point, notably larger than the overall increase. Such data are consistent with a report in the most recent Beige Book, a compilation of anecdotal information from around the country shared with Fed officials before our meetings, indicating some recent graduates are facing unexpected difficulties finding suitable jobs.\n2\nIt is also the case that less-educated and minority workers could face greater hurdles, as they tend to benefit more from tighter labor markets and suffer more from weakening economic conditions.\nThe slowing of the solid labor market has come alongside a significant easing in inflationary pressure. Inflation was 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in July, notably closer to our 2 percent target than a year earlier\u00e2\u0080\u0094when inflation was 3.3 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0094and far below its peak of 7 percent in mid-2022. In recent months, the upside risks to inflation have diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased. In response to these changing conditions, I whole heartedly supported the decision at last week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting to lower our policy interest rate by 1/2 percentage point. The FOMC, of which I am a member, is the Federal Reserve's primary monetary policymaking body. That decision reflected growing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, the solid labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate economic growth and inflation continuing to move sustainably down to our target. In thinking about the path of policy moving forward, I will be looking carefully at incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\nThe return to balance in the labor market between supply and demand, as well as the ongoing return toward our inflation target, reflects the normalization of the economy after the dislocations of the pandemic. This normalization, particularly of inflation, is quite welcome, as a balance between supply and demand is essential for sustaining a prolonged period of labor-market strength. Of course, there will always be new developments and changes that will reshape the labor market. Recent advances in AI technology are perhaps the most talked about and debated of such developments today. I anticipate that these advances may have a significant effect on workers, the labor market, and the economy in coming years.\nArtificial Intelligence and Productivity\nFrom the outset, I, like most of my economist colleagues studying the economics of innovation and AI closely, acknowledge that the implications of AI are highly uncertain. We still do not know what the ultimate magnitude or intensity of this effect will be, which workers and firms will be most affected, or even the time period over which these effects will be realized. But today, I will highlight how economic theory and some recent studies can shed initial light on these critical questions.\nThe key reason why many expect AI will have a substantial effect on the economy is, because AI has the potential to provide a large and sustained boost to labor-productivity growth\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is simply how much output of an individual worker grows over time. Ultimately, growth in output per person, workers' real earnings, and households' real purchasing power can all be tied back to growth in labor productivity. Like many of the most significant technological innovations of the past 200 or so years\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as the steam engine, electricity, computers, and the internet\u00e2\u0080\u0094AI has the potential to affect labor productivity in a plethora of economic activities across many industries and occupations.\nFor instance, over the past few years we have seen dramatic advances in generative AI technologies, which synthesize massive quantities of data to create models that can produce high-quality text, images, and video. Building upon these recent advances, a wide variety of new AI assistants have been deployed to help workers in a broad range of jobs. Although the degree to which these new assistants will improve labor productivity is likely to be quite idiosyncratic, some early studies suggest the effects could be large. One recent study examined the effect of an AI assistant for customer support agents and found that agents using the AI assistant resolved 14 percent more customer issues per hour\u00e2\u0080\u0094with this improvement being most pronounced for workers with comparatively less experience and less formal training.\n3\nBut perhaps even more promising is AI's potential for improving our ability to generate new ideas. AI is being used in drug discovery to identify novel chemical compounds; in energy research to extend the duration of a fusion reaction; and in engineering to better understand the aerodynamics of automobiles, airplanes, and ships. If AI can improve our ability to generate new ideas, then it could provide a long-term boost to labor productivity growth, as each newly discovered idea will itself provide an incremental boost to labor productivity.\nJudging the Effect of Artificial Intelligence on Occupations\nBecause of their effects on labor productivity, past technological innovations have resulted in dramatic positive and negative shocks to the demand for specific occupations or tasks. We should expect AI to do the same: eliminating some jobs but, crucially, also creating new ones. As a society, we will need to consider how to retrain and support workers who may be displaced from their jobs, even as many others benefit from AI adoption. As I think about AI's implications for employment in any given job or task, I tend to focus on three questions.\nHow much exposure?\nFirst, how exposed is a particular job to AI?\nIt is helpful to think about a job as a set of tasks that the worker must perform. Economist David Autor pioneered this task-based framework for jobs. He used it to demonstrate that the shift in labor demand, which began in the 1970s, away from jobs that involved a large degree of routine tasks can be explained by these jobs' greater exposure to the rapid adoption of computerization and automation technologies.\n4\nWe can take a similar task-based approach to determine a job's exposure to AI.\nStart by considering what share of a job's tasks can be performed by AI. For example, we might expect AI to be able to perform a larger share of a software programmer's tasks versus those of a plumber.\nNext, for those tasks that can be performed by AI, consider how well AI performs them relative to a typical worker. For instance, generative AI is used in a medical setting to summarize patient interviews\u00e2\u0080\u0094a task that it performs quite well relative to a human doctor. Based on that interview, AI could diagnose a patient and develop a treatment plan, but these are tasks that doctors still tend to perform better than AI.\nFinally, for those tasks that can be performed by AI, think about the quality threshold required for that job task.\nComing back to the example of a doctor and AI, while there may be some tolerance for incorrectly summarizing a patient interview, there is little tolerance for misdiagnosing a patient or developing a bad treatment plan. I would also note that we may have higher quality thresholds for AI than we do for human workers\u00e2\u0080\u0094with driverless cars being an example where AI drivers may be held to a higher standard than human drivers. Thus, a job will be more exposed to AI, if AI can perform a large share of the job's tasks sufficiently well relative to a human worker and a set of quality thresholds. Importantly, we can expect that a job's exposure to AI will change over time, because advances in AI technology will both expand the set of tasks that AI can perform and improve the quality of AI's performance of those tasks.\nWhich brings me to my second question for AI's implications for any given job.\nComplement or substitute?\nWill AI be a complement to or a substitute for the job, given its set of tasks?\nAI is more likely to serve as a complement to jobs that have less exposure to AI but use the services or products that are produced by jobs with a high degree of AI exposure. For instance, a job as a litigator may have little direct exposure to AI but will benefit from AI's ability to assist with legal research.\n5\nEven for some jobs with a high degree of exposure to AI, it is possible for AI to serve as a complement. Let's return to the example of the doctor, who may now see more patients or spend more time on diagnoses, because AI has taken over writing summaries of patient interviews. More broadly, jobs with a high degree of exposure to AI will likely be complemented by AI, if workers are able to offload time-intensive, but low value-added, tasks to AI and focus their time on the highest value-added tasks.\nHowever, we can expect that there will be some jobs that have a high degree of exposure to AI and for which AI can perform some especially high-valued tasks. Thus, AI may be more of a substitute for human labor in these jobs. But even for these jobs, the employment implications are ambiguous and will depend on the third question.\nWhat is the elasticity of demand?\nWhat is the price elasticity of demand for the output of these jobs that are highly affected by AI?\nTo understand what I mean, it is helpful to consider a concrete example. I want to come back to the software programmer jobs that I mentioned before as having a high degree of exposure to AI. Recent advances in generative AI have resulted in the development of new AI-powered coding assistants that help automate some aspects of writing software code. Some early studies have found that these AI coding assistants can provide a significant boost to programmers' productivity. One randomized controlled trial found that these AI coding assistants cut in half the amount of time it took to finish a small programming project.\n6\nAnother study found that programmers who were randomly assigned to use an AI coding assistant submitted 20 percent more requests each week asking to add code they had written to a software project.\n7\nAnd I emphasize that these tools are still in their infancy, which suggests that the productivity gains for software-programming jobs may be even larger.\nThese productivity enhancements will allow software programming projects to be delivered in less time and at a lower cost. As we know from economic theory, as the costs and delivery times for software projects fall, demand for such projects should increase. The number of software-programming jobs will depend on whether the demand for software projects increases more than one for one with the decrease in cost. In other words, is the price elasticity of demand for software projects greater than one? If it is, then the reduction in software programmers' hours devoted to programming tasks that can now be performed by AI will be more than offset by the increase in their hours from the greater demand for AI-enhanced software programming.\nI find these questions helpful for framing how to think about AI's implications for any job or set of tasks. While I mentioned that there will likely be benefits for certain workers, it is important to recognize a universal lesson from past technological innovations\u00e2\u0080\u0094namely, that the employment and earnings of some workers are likely to be negatively affected by these innovations. The magnitude and extent of these negative effects will depend on a variety of fa",

Barr\nAt the 2024 U.S. Treasury Market Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, New York\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nIt is great to be here again, particularly because this year marks the 10th annual conference on the Treasury market, a milestone that is worth celebrating. I want to acknowledge the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for its leadership in this area, including the dedication and excellence it has brought to hosting this conference over the past decade, in collaboration with the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance, led by the Treasury Department. The Treasury market is the means by which our government meets its financing needs in service to the American people, and it is also the bedrock of the financial system. Promoting the resilience of the Treasury market and ensuring it can continue to fulfill these roles requires the collaboration of agencies and individuals across the government along with the private sector.\nAs others have pointed out today, we have made important progress since last year's conference. The Securities and Exchange Commission has finalized a rule on central clearing of Treasury transactions, the Treasury Department has instituted a program for buying back less-liquid Treasury securities, and the Office of Financial Research is preparing for its permanent collection of data on non-centrally-cleared bilateral repurchase agreement (repo) transactions, which will support our understanding of this market segment as it evolves.\nI will share some thoughts with you on how I see the work of the Federal Reserve in supporting Treasury market resilience. Our capital and liquidity regulations, our supervision of the firms over which we have authority, and our liquidity facilities play important roles in supporting market resilience and financial stability. Earlier this month, I gave a speech where I reiterated the crucial role of capital in serving these objectives, and the need to balance resilience and efficiency in designing our rules. In that speech, I also outlined the elements of a capital re-proposal that I believe will have broad consensus at the Federal Reserve Board. The adjustments are in response to a robust public comment process, and some of them are designed to address interactions and market functioning concerns raised by commentators.\nIn terms of rulemaking, today I will focus on some additional aspects of our regulatory framework\u00e2\u0080\u0094namely, enhancements to our liquidity regulations. I will share some perspective on how our liquidity regulations work together and are supportive of market functioning and the smooth implementation of monetary policy.\nThe Intersection of Monetary Policy Tools and Supervision and Regulation\nWe consider how all of the Fed's tools work together to support our objectives. In previous speeches, I have talked about the role of the discount window and the standing repo facility (SRF) in supporting both monetary policy implementation and financial stability, noting how important it is that eligible institutions be ready to use these facilities.\n2\nToday I want to dig into this topic a bit more, including how these tools support monetary policy implementation through appropriate incorporation into liquidity regulations and supervisory practices.\nAfter the banking stress in March 2023, we saw a substantial improvement among banks of all sizes in their level of readiness to tap the discount window both in taking the necessary steps for set-up and in their pledging of collateral. Since that time, over $1 trillion in additional collateral has been pledged to the discount window, and additional banks have established access to the SRF. Both of these facilities are potential venues for monetizing assets and raising liquidity to address volatility in private funding market rates or gaps in the availability of private-market funding.\nWe had been hearing that some were confused about how banks could incorporate ready access to the discount window and the SRF into their contingency funding plans and internal liquidity stress tests. Supervisors have a role in assessing the viability of large banks' plans to meet stressed outflows in their stress scenarios, and we have been asked whether the discount window, the SRF, and also Federal Home Loan Bank advances can play a role in those scenarios. The answer to this question is \"yes.\"\nWe provided clarity to the public in August on permissible assumptions for how firms can incorporate the discount window and the SRF into their internal liquidity stress-test scenarios. There are a couple of principles that underlie our response in the frequently asked questions we posted on the Board's website.\n3\nOne principle is that our tools are readily available to firms. This means that we see it as acceptable and beneficial for firms to incorporate our facilities to meet liquidity needs in both planning and practice. If firms plan to use our facilities, we expect them to demonstrate ex ante that they are fully capable of doing so, including through test transactions. An additional principle underlying our approach is that, while firms should be ready to use a range of funding sources, firms need to hold sufficient highly liquid assets to meet their potential liquidity needs. That is, they need to self-insure against their own liquidity risks. A third principle is that firms should be ready and able to use private channels to turn these assets into cash, in addition to any public channels they may plan to use.\nI want to dig a bit deeper into the benefits to both individual firms and the financial system when firms incorporate Fed facilities into their stress preparedness planning. Again, a design feature of our liquidity regulations is that large banks must\nself-insure\nagainst\nmajor liquidity risks. Our regulations also provide flexibility in terms of the portfolio composition such banks use to do so. This flexibility allows them to adjust their portfolios based on market conditions and firm needs. A key component of this flexibility is that reserves and certain high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), such as Treasury securities, are equivalent in terms of being treated as the highest quality of liquid assets. This feature is important because, while it allows firms to manage their liquidity buffers more flexibly, it also allows for greater flexibility in our monetary policy implementation and it supports market functioning. We have heard over the years, however, that the degree of substitutability among these assets has been limited by concerns about capacity in stress for the market to turn securities into reserves immediately; these concerns are valid. This constraint can be addressed in part by the appropriate incorporation of Federal Reserve facilities into monetization plans in firms' internal liquidity stress tests.\nWhen firms understand that they will not be fully constrained by the capacity of private markets or their individual credit lines to monetize HQLA immediately in stress, they can reduce their demand for reserves in favor of Treasury securities, all else being equal, for their stress planning purposes. This dynamic improves the substitutability of holding reserves and holding Treasury securities either outright or through repo transactions.\nWhen banks exhibit a high degree of substitutability of demand for these assets, money market functioning improves. Let me explain with an example. If a bank sees holding reserves and investing in Treasury repo as near substitutes in its liquidity portfolio, it should lend into Treasury repo markets when repo rates rise above the interest rate earned on reserves. When banks can nimbly adjust portfolios in response to price incentives, the efficiency of reserves redistribution through the system improves, and market functioning is enhanced.\nIn aggregate, this activity can prevent rates from rising further, all else being equal. The point at which banks, in aggregate, have a relatively immutable demand for reserves, and are unwilling to lend them out, is evident when a small decrease in the supply of reserves results in a sharp increase in the cost to borrow them. Our monetary policy tools are well positioned to help us avoid this outcome. But, of course, greater willingness of banks to reallocate across close substitutes should help avoid the emergence of sudden pressures in money markets by reducing money market frictions.\nIn 2021, the Federal Reserve launched the SRF, which, along with the discount window, should help cap upward pressure in repo markets that could spill over into the federal funds market. Use of these facilities also increases the supply of reserves in the system. The enhanced clarity for firms that Fed facilities are a fully acceptable venue to get same-day liquidity for their HQLA should help reassure firms about holding reserves and their close substitutes, such as Treasury securities, in their liquidity portfolios.\nOf course, as I stated earlier, for the largest banks, there is a requirement that they hold highly liquid assets to address their own liquidity risks. They must also be ready to use private markets to monetize these assets. It is also critical that banks recognize and manage the interest rate and liquidity risk of their securities portfolios to ensure those securities held for liquidity purposes can be monetized in stress without creating other adverse effects on a firm's safety and soundness. In 2022 and 2023, certain large banks did not effectively manage the risks of rising rates, and suffered significant fair value losses on their securities holdings, including those in held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolios. These losses affected their ability to respond to liquidity stress, as monetizing the assets could result in realizing losses. When the banking stress hit in March 2023, these securities could not be sold to meet stressed outflows because large unrealized losses inhibited their sale without significant capital implications. This is further complicated in the case of HTM securities, which cannot be sold without risking revaluing a firm's entire HTM portfolio. Selling HTM securities to generate liquidity would therefore have had a particularly large effect on these firms' capital levels, likely increasing the stress on these firms. Further, some firms were unable to rely on private channels such as repo markets for monetization because they were not prepared, they were not regular participants in the market, and market participants were unwilling to lend because of counterparty credit concerns. This combination of factors meant that HTM securities that had been identified by banks as available to serve as a liquidity buffer of assets in stress could not effectively serve that function.\nImprovements to Our Liquidity Regulations\nAs I have mentioned in previous speeches, to address the lessons about liquidity learned in the spring of 2023, we are exploring targeted adjustments to our current liquidity framework.\n4\nMany firms have taken steps to improve their liquidity resilience, and the regulatory adjustments we are considering would ensure that large banks maintain better liquidity risk\u00e2\u0080\u0093management practices going forward. Improvements to our liquidity regulations will also complement the other components of our supervisory and regulatory regime by improving banks' ability to respond to funding shocks.\nSpecifically, we are exploring a requirement that larger banks maintain a minimum amount of readily available liquidity with a pool of reserves and pre-positioned collateral at the discount window, based on a fraction of their uninsured deposits. Community banks would not be covered, and we would take a tiered approach to the requirements. The collateral pre-positioned at the window could include both Treasury securities and the full range of assets eligible for pledging at the discount window. It is vital that uninsured depositors have confidence that their funds will be readily available for withdrawal, if needed, and this confidence would be enhanced by a requirement that larger banks have readily available liquidity to meet requests for withdrawal of these deposits. This requirement would be a complement to existing liquidity regulations such as those that require the internal liquidity stress tests (ILST) I described earlier as well as meeting the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).\n5\nIncorporating the discount window into a readiness requirement would also reemphasize that supervisors and examiners view use of the discount window as appropriate under both normal and stressed market conditions.\nIn addition, as I have discussed previously, we identified significant gaps in interest rate risk management in the March 2023 banking stress, including in portfolios of highly liquid securities. Relatedly, we saw that banks faced constraints in monetizing HTM assets with large unrealized losses in private markets because they were unable to repo these securities or sell these securities without realizing significant losses. To address these gaps, we are considering a partial limit on the extent of reliance on HTM assets in larger banks' liquidity buffers, such as those held under the LCR and ILST requirements. These adjustments would address the known challenges of banks being able to use these assets in stress conditions.\nFinally, we are reviewing the treatment of a handful of types of deposits in the current liquidity framework. Observed behavior of different deposit types during times of stress suggests the need to recalibrate deposit outflow assumptions in our rules for certain types of depositors. We are also revisiting the scope of application of our current liquidity framework for large banks.\nThese enhancements to our liquidity regulations will help bolster firms' ability to manage liquidity shocks, and they will also be well integrated with our monetary policy tools and framework.\nModernizing Our Tools to Meet Current and Future Needs\nTurning back to the discount window, I also want to note that the discount window has served its role well in recent years, and that we are also engaging in ongoing work to improve its operations. Given the crucial role of the discount window in providing ready access to liquidity in a wide variety of market conditions, we continuously work to assess and improve its functionality while engaging with current and potential users of the window.\nAmong the steps we have taken recently include that we now have an online portal, Discount Window Direct, that allows firms to request and prepay discount window loans in a more streamlined manner than was previously possibl",

It is surprising because it does not seem like the first of these gatherings, which I was honored to play a role in organizing, was all that long ago. But we can also take pride because the conference has proven useful and important for a full decade, as I expect it will do for many more years to come.\nMuch has changed in the economy since we first gathered in 2015\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the importance of the U.S. Treasury market has not. As you all know, this market is the deepest and most liquid in the world. In addition to meeting the financing needs of the federal government, it plays a critical role in the implementation of monetary policy. It is no exaggeration to say that the Treasury market is part of the bedrock of our economy and indeed of the world economy.\nThe October '14 flash crash and the subsequent publication of the Interagency Working Group report on that event are what brought us together for the first annual conference.\n1\nOctober 2014 was a wakeup call because there had never been such a large swing in Treasury prices in such a short period of time. The Interagency Working Group report shed light on how much the structure of the Treasury market had changed and how large a role high-speed, electronic trading firms were playing in it. It also showed the value of cooperation and communication between the five agencies in the working group, something that proved again to be vital during the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nI am pleased to see that all working group members are represented here today. You will be hearing directly from many senior leaders, including your host, President Williams; Vice Chair Barr; and Secretary Yellen, who, of course, was Fed chair at the time of the first conference.\nIt is essential that our Treasury markets are able to efficiently transform Treasury securities into cash, even at times of elevated stress. As I noted at this event in 2015, \"these markets need to keep functioning at a high level, and we all have a stake in making sure that they do.\" I remain wholly dedicated to that goal.\n2\nI wish you a productive and educational conference. Thank you.\n1.

Bowman\nAt the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America Board of Directors Workshop, Dallas, Texas\nShare\nGood morning. I would like to thank the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America for the invitation to join you today for the Board of Directors Workshop.\n1\nI appreciate the opportunity to share my views on the U.S. economy and monetary policy before we engage on bank supervisory and regulatory issues and other matters affecting the banking industry.\nIn light of last week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I will begin my remarks by providing some perspective on my vote and will then share my current views on the economy and monetary policy.\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting\nIn order to address high inflation, for more than two years, the FOMC increased and held the federal funds rate at a restrictive level. At our September meeting, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent and to continue reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.\nAs the post-meeting statement noted, I dissented from the FOMC's decision, preferring instead to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 5 to 5\u00e2\u0080\u00911/4 percent. Last Friday, once our FOMC participant communications blackout period concluded, the Board of Governors released my statement explaining the decision to depart from the majority of the voting members. I agreed with the Committee's assessment that, given the progress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market, it was appropriate to reflect this progress by recalibrating the level of the federal funds rate and begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance of policy. As my statement notes, I preferred a smaller initial cut in the policy rate while the U.S. economy remains strong and inflation remains a concern, despite recent progress.\nEconomic Conditions and Outlook\nIn recent months, we have seen some further progress on slowing the pace of inflation, with monthly readings lower than the elevated pace seen in the first three months of the year. The 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which provides a broader perspective than the more volatile higher-frequency readings, has moved down since April, although it came in at 2.6 percent in July, again remaining well above our 2 percent goal. In addition, the latest consumer and producer price index reports suggest that 12\u00e2\u0080\u0091month core PCE inflation in August was likely a touch above the July reading. The persistently high core inflation largely reflects pressures on housing prices, perhaps due in part to low inventories of affordable housing. The progress in lowering inflation since April is a welcome development, but core inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee's 2 percent goal.\nPrices remain much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh on consumer sentiment. Higher prices have an outsized effect on lower- and moderate-income households, as these households devote a significantly larger share of income to food, energy, and housing. Prices for these spending categories have far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years.\nEconomic growth moderated earlier this year after coming in stronger last year. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP) growth has been solid and slowed much less than gross domestic product (GDP), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile categories including net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than GDP indicated. PDFP has continued to increase at a solid pace so far in the third quarter, despite some further weakening in housing activity, as retail sales have shown further robust gains in July and August.\nAlthough personal consumption has remained resilient, consumers appear to be pulling back on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant spending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have extra savings to support this type of spending, and we have seen loan delinquency rates normalize from historically low levels during the pandemic.\nThe most recent labor market report shows that payroll employment gains have slowed appreciably to a pace moderately above 100,000 per month over the three months ending in August. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.2 percent in August from 4.3 percent in July. While unemployment is notably higher than a year ago, it is still at a historically low level and below my and the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of full employment.\nThe labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined further to a touch below the historically elevated pre-pandemic level\u00e2\u0080\u0094a sign that the number of available workers and the number of available jobs have come into better balance. But there are still more available jobs than available workers, a condition that before 2018 has only occurred twice for a prolonged period since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength despite the reported data.\nAlthough wage growth has slowed further in recent months, it remains indicative of a tight labor market. At just under 4 percent, as measured by both the employment cost index and average hourly earnings, wage gains are still above the pace consistent with our inflation goal given trend productivity growth.\nThe rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs remain low. In addition to some cooling in labor demand, there are other factors likely contributing the increased unemployment. A mismatch between the skills of the new workers and available jobs could further raise unemployment, suggesting that higher unemployment has been partly driven by the stronger supply of workers. It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the recent rise in the unemployment rate, as unemployment among working age teenagers sharply increased in August.\nPreference for a More Measured Recalibration of Policy\nThe U.S. economy remains strong and core inflation remains uncomfortably above our 2 percent target. In light of these economic conditions, a few further considerations supported the case for a more measured approach in beginning the process to recalibrate our policy stance to remove restriction and move toward a more neutral setting.\nFirst, I was concerned that reducing the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point could be interpreted as a signal that the Committee sees some fragility or greater downside risks to the economy. In the current economic environment, with no clear signs of material weakening or fragility, in my view, beginning the rate-cutting cycle with a 1/4 percentage point move would have better reinforced the strength in economic conditions, while also confidently recognizing progress toward our goals. In my mind, a more measured approach would have avoided the risk of unintentionally signaling concerns about underlying economic conditions.\nSecond, I was also concerned that reducing the policy rate by 1/2 percentage point could have led market participants to expect that the Committee would lower the target range by that same pace at future meetings until the policy rate approaches a neutral level. If this expectation had materialized, we could have seen an unwarranted decline in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions could become overly accommodative. This outcome could work against the Committee's goal of returning inflation to our 2 percent target.\nI am pleased that Chair Powell directly addressed both of these concerns during the press conference following last week's FOMC meeting.\nThird, there continues to be a considerable amount of pent-up demand and cash on the sidelines ready to be deployed as the path of interest rates moves down. Bringing the policy rate down too quickly carries the risk of unleashing that pent-up demand. A more measured approach would also avoid unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures.\nFinally, in dialing back our restrictive stance of policy, we also need to be mindful of what the end point is likely to be. My estimate of the neutral rate is much higher than it was before the pandemic. Therefore, I think we are much closer to neutral than would have been the case under pre-pandemic conditions, and I did not see the peak stance of policy as restrictive to the same extent that my colleagues may have. With a higher estimate of neutral, for any given pace of rate reductions, we would arrive at our destination sooner.\nOngoing Risks to the Outlook\nTurning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market continues to be near estimates of full employment. Although the labor market data have been showing signs of cooling in recent months, still-elevated wage growth, solid consumer spending, and resilient GDP growth are not consistent with a material economic weakening or fragility. My contacts also continue to mention that they are not planning layoffs and continue to have difficulty hiring. Therefore, I am taking less signal from the recent labor market data until there are clear trends indicating that both spending growth and the labor market have materially weakened. I suspect the recent immigration flows have and will continue to affect labor markets in ways that we do not yet fully understand and cannot yet accurately measure. In light of the dissonance created by conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.\nIn my view, the upside risks to inflation remain prominent. Global supply chains continue to be susceptible to labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, which could result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. Expansionary fiscal spending could also lead to inflationary risks, as could an increased demand for housing given the long-standing limited supply, especially of affordable housing. While it has not been my baseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation could continue to stall.\nAlthough it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on lowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that the Committee's larger policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate. Accomplishing our mission of returning to low and stable inflation at our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term.\nIn light of these considerations, I believe that, by moving at a measured pace toward a more neutral policy stance, we will be better positioned to achieve further progress in bringing inflation down to our 2 percent target, while closely watching the evolution of labor market conditions.\nThe Path Forward\nDespite my dissent at the recent FOMC meeting, I respect and appreciate that my FOMC colleagues preferred to begin the reduction in the federal funds rate with a larger initial cut in the target range for the policy rate. I remain committed to working together with my colleagues to ensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our goals of attaining maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent target.\nI will continue to monitor the incoming data and information as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to adjusting the stance of policy going forward. It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. We need to ensure that the public understands clearly how current and expected deviations of inflation and employment from our mandated goals inform our policy decisions.\nBy the time of our next meeting in November, we will have received updated reports on inflation, employment, and economic activity. We may also have a better understanding of how developments in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions might influence the economic outlook.\nDuring the intermeeting period, I will continue to visit with a broad range of contacts to discuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As I noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as a concern. In light of the upside risks that I just described, it remains necessary to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate while being attentive to the risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view continues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run. However, should the data evolve in a way that points to a material weakening in the labor market, I would support taking action and adjust monetary policy as needed while taking into account our inflation mandate.\nClosing Thoughts\nIn closing, thank you again for welcoming me here today. It is a pleasure to join you and to have the opportunity to discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy. And given the recent FOMC meeting decision and my dissent, I appreciate being able to provide a more detailed explanation of the reasoning that led me to dissent in favor of a smaller reduction in the policy rate at last week's FOMC meeting.\nI look forward to answering your questions and to engaging with your members on bank regulatory and supervisory matters.\n1. The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors.\nReturn to text\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            September 26, 2024",

Kugler\nAt the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government, Harvard Kennedy School, Cambridge, Massachusetts\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, John, and thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.\n1\nIt is good to be back at the Kennedy School and in particular at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center, which has a long tradition of engaging on important policy issues.\nIn my remarks today, I will provide my outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy. The combination of significant ongoing progress in reducing inflation and a cooling in the labor market means that the time has come to begin easing monetary policy, and I strongly supported the decision last week by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points. While future actions by the FOMC will depend on data we receive on inflation, employment, and economic activity, if conditions continue to evolve in the direction traveled thus far, then additional cuts will be appropriate.\nI will begin by summarizing where we stand on inflation, including details on how the different components of inflation have changed over time, since these facts form the basis for my judgment on where inflation is headed. I will then talk about the recent cooling in the labor market and the forces driving it as well as how shifts on this other side of our mandate fit into the overall economic outlook for the rest of this year. I will conclude with the implications of all this for appropriate monetary policy and our focus on our dual mandate.\nInflation based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has come down from a peak of 7.1 percent on a year-on-year basis to 2.5 percent in July. Core PCE inflation, which excludes energy and food prices and tends to be less volatile, has come down from a peak of 5.6 percent to now 2.6 percent. Based on consumer and producer price indexes, I estimate headline PCE and core PCE inflation to be at about 2.2 and 2.7 percent, respectively, in August, consistent with ongoing progress toward the FOMC's 2 percent target. The progress on inflation is good news, but it is important to remember that households and businesses are still dealing with prices for many goods and services that are significantly higher than a couple of years ago. Prices for groceries, for example, are about 20 percent higher than before inflation started rising in 2021, and while earnings have been rising faster than inflation, it may take some time for it to feel as though prices are back to normal.\n2\nInflation data are produced by the Labor Department, and when I served as chief economist at Labor, I delved into the differential effects of inflation on various demographic groups. When inflation was at its peak in 2022, it was more than 1 percentage point higher for lower-income households, for those without a college degree, and for those aged 18 to 29\u00e2\u0080\u0094all groups that spend a higher share of income on necessities and have less wealth to draw from.\n3\nFortunately, research by staff at the Fed shows that disinflation helps close that gap as well, something that only adds to the urgency I feel about returning inflation to the FOMC's 2 percent goal.\nResearch on the causes of inflation and the subsequent disinflation show that both supply and demand forces have played an important role. In the past two years, specifically, improvements in supply, along with moderation in demand in part due to tighter monetary policy, have both played a role in the disinflationary process.\n4\nSupply chain bottlenecks as well as the drastic drop in the labor force due to excess retirements and the withdrawal of prime-age workers contributed to the initial rise in inflation, but the resolution of these disruptions and the return of workers to the labor force have also helped rein in inflation. Early on, consumers shifted spending from services to goods, a development that goods producers struggled to accommodate, putting upward pressure on prices. But as the demand shock to goods unwound and consumer spending shifted back to services, goods inflation fell and has been running below zero in recent months. Also, the increased demand due to the fiscal response to COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021 has more recently been roughly neutral on growth, as shown by the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy in their measure of fiscal impact. And, of course, as I will discuss in a moment, tight monetary policy has been and continues to be a moderating force on demand, primarily by raising costs for interest-sensitive goods and services.\nAs I think about where inflation is headed, I find it helpful to consider how it has evolved over the past several years and in particular how the major components of inflation have behaved, so I want to take a few minutes to walk through those details.\nAs I have indicated, the big picture is that goods inflation surged early on in 2020 and 2021, followed by prices for services excluding housing, and then housing, with some overlap in those steps. Disinflation has followed that course in reverse. Core goods inflation rose, after almost a year of social distancing shifted spending from services and after production and delivery of goods was disrupted by the pandemic. This was a big change because over the long expansion leading to the pandemic, core goods prices actually fell, slightly but consistently.\n5\nOn a 12-month basis, core PCE goods inflation rose above zero in December 2020, reached a peak of 7.6 percent in February 2022, and fell again below zero at the end of 2023. In July of this year, it was negative 0.5 percent. This recent disinflation offset still-rising prices for services and helped reduce overall inflation. Goods inflation has reverted to its longer-term pattern as demand has moderated and supply chain problems have abated. This is reflected by various indexes of supply chain bottlenecks that showed the supply-side disruptions that contributed early on to surging inflation have now retreated to pre-pandemic levels.\n6\nOther data show that computer chip supply, which fell far short of demand early in the pandemic, is back to normal conditions as well.\nFood and energy prices, always subject to larger ups and downs than other parts of inflation, rose also early on. Food inflation increased in 2020 as shoppers began stockpiling groceries and as warehouses and production facilities had difficulty staffing due to COVID. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, energy price inflation reached a peak 12-month rate of nearly 45 percent and food inflation reached a peak of 12 percent in mid-2022, highlighting the importance of petroleum and agricultural commodities from that part of the world. Food and energy inflation has moderated over the past two years and are now both running at 12-month rates of 1.4 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, as supply chain issues have resolved and production in the U.S. and elsewhere has increased. Food and energy expenses represent a sizable share of consumer spending, but the frequent purchase of these goods means that they are highly salient in the public's views on inflation. Research by Francesco D'Acunto and coauthors has shown that the weights that consumers assign to price changes in forming their inflation expectations are not based on the actual share of their expenditures but instead on the frequency of purchases, which happen to be highest for food and energy goods.\n7\nThus, the fall in food and energy prices is important because it may feed back into lower inflation in other categories by moderating overall inflation expectations and also real wage expectations in wage bargaining.\nHousing services price increases were the last component of inflation to escalate, rising to a peak 12-month rate of 8.3 percent in April 2023 and moderating to a 5.3 percent pace in July. It took time for housing prices to escalate and has taken longer for them to moderate because of both the nature of the rental market and the data collection method from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as I have discussed at length in other speeches.\n8\nHowever, new rent increases, which better capture rental price changes in real time, are falling and are the main reason why I expect housing services costs to moderate further.\nThe final component of inflation is services excluding housing, which accounts for 50 percent of PCE inflation and is heavily influenced by labor markets. On a 12-month basis, this component of inflation rose to a peak of 5.3 percent in December 2021, stayed persistently high until February 2023, and has moderated since then to 3.3 percent in July of this year. Its escalation was driven both by the rise in labor costs and by the transition of demand from goods to services following the pandemic. Labor costs are a substantial share of the total costs for services. For example, labor accounts for between 60 percent to 80 percent of costs in construction, education, and health services.\nAmong the initial forces driving the escalation in wages were the increase in food and energy prices, as wage demands tend to track closely with the prices of these frequently purchased goods. Data on wage demands from the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations indeed show a sudden increase early on during the pandemic right after the first bout of food inflation.\n9\nImportantly, worker shortages likely allowed those higher wage demands to be realized, contributing to the rise in wages. Later, as demand for services quickly rose and employers were creating a large number of jobs in several service sectors, workers were able to be more selective, and the ensuing \"Great Resignation\" took hold, allowing people to choose different careers. The relatively high demand relative to the supply of workers in some service sectors encouraged workers to move from job to job for higher wages, benefits, and other improvements in working conditions. Evidence from the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker suggests that during this period, wages for job switchers grew more than 2 percentage points faster than wages for people staying in the same job, though this wage premium for job switchers disappeared by the second half of last year.\nBut now inflation for services excluding housing is declining, after a temporary escalation in the first quarter of this year that was likely partly due to residual seasonality. There had been fears that wage increases would drive a wage\u00e2\u0080\u0093price spiral, as the U.S. experienced in the 1970s, but this did not occur.\nTo sum up, inflation has broadly moderated as the supply of goods and services has improved, and as producers and consumers have adjusted to the effects of higher prices. Demand has moderated, in part due to tighter monetary policy. And, as I just noted, changes in the pace of wage growth have also played an important role in the ups and downs of inflation, which points me toward a discussion of labor markets, which has recently become a greater focus of monetary policy.\nAs I have noted, there has been a significant moderation in the labor market recently, but I want to start by pointing to what really has been a remarkable performance of the labor market over the past four years. After the unprecedented job losses early in the pandemic, and even accounting for the quick recovery of a large share of those losses, the recovery of the labor market that followed was historically swift. Unemployment was 7.8 percent in September 2020 and 4.7 percent only 12 months later, and it fell to under 4 percent 3 months after that. That is a more rapid recovery than the U.S. has experienced since the 1960's. What started, at that point, was 30 straight months of unemployment at or below 4 percent, which had not happened during the pre-pandemic period, the boom of the 1990s, or anytime during the 1980s, and it was only exceeded by the strong labor market of the latter half of the 1960s. Something that I think was just as remarkable has been the narrowing of the typical gap between labor market outcomes for less-advantaged groups. For example, there has been a reduction in the unemployment rate between Black and Latino workers, on the one hand, and white workers, on the other hand. There has also been a narrowing of the prime-age labor force participation rate among these groups, and, perhaps most notable of all, wage inequality among them has narrowed, which is not typical during economic expansions, according to research by David Autor and several coauthors.\n10\nThey found that one benefit of the unusually tight labor market of the past few years was that the heightened competition for scarce workers produced more rapid wage gains for workers at the bottom of the wage distribution. The real wage gains for those in the lower quartiles of the distribution and with higher propensities to consume, in turn, likely spurred consumption and helped sustain growth after the pandemic.\nAfter a couple of years in which labor demand exceeded supply, the labor market has come into balance, reflecting an economy that has moderated in part due to tighter monetary policy. On the labor supply side, two forces have contributed to this rebalancing of the labor market. Labor force participation suffered due to the disruptions in work during the pandemic but rebounded strongly in 2022 and 2023 as the labor market tightened and wages rose sharply. The labor force participation rate for prime-age women reached historic highs over the past year and reached yet another historic record high in August. The overall increase in participation among workers aged 25 to 54, in the prime of their working lives, helped offset the loss of many workers aged 55 and over who experienced excess retirements during the pandemic. The second force boosting labor supply has been the large increase in immigration. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that net immigration boosted the U.S. population by close to 6 million people in 2022 and 2023, the majority of them of working age, and, by most accounts, rates of immigration have remained high in 2024.\nAs a result of improved supply and easing of demand for workers, the labor market has rebalanced. After running at very low levels, unemployment has edged up this year to 4.2 percent in August, still quite low by historical standards. The slowdown in labor demand is most evident in payroll numbers. Job creation averaged 267,000 a month in the first quarter of the year and now stands at an average of 116,000 in the three months ending in August, which is still a healthy pace of job creation. Yet, given recent revisions in the payroll numbers, it is important to continue monitoring additional labor market indicators. In addition, the",

Bowman\nAt the 2024 Kentucky Bankers Association Annual Convention, Hot Springs, Virginia\nShare\nGood morning. I would like to thank the Kentucky Bankers Association for the invitation to join you today for your annual convention.\n1\nI appreciate the opportunity to share my views on the U.S. economy and monetary policy before we engage on community banking issues and other matters affecting the banking industry.\nIn light of last week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I will begin my remarks by providing some perspective on my vote and will then share my current views on the economy and monetary policy.\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting\nIn order to address high inflation, for more than two years, the FOMC increased and held the federal funds rate at a restrictive level. At our September meeting, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent and to continue reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.\nAs the post-meeting statement noted, I dissented from the FOMC's decision, preferring instead to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 5 to 5\u00e2\u0080\u00911/4 percent. Last Friday, once our FOMC participant communications blackout period concluded, the Board of Governors released my statement explaining the decision to depart from the majority of the voting members. I agreed with the Committee's assessment that, given the progress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market, it was appropriate to reflect this progress by recalibrating the level of the federal funds rate and begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance of policy. As my statement notes, I preferred a smaller initial cut in the policy rate while the U.S. economy remains strong and inflation remains a concern, despite recent progress.\nEconomic Conditions and Outlook\nIn recent months, we have seen some further progress on slowing the pace of inflation, with monthly readings lower than the elevated pace seen in the first three months of the year. The 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which provides a broader perspective than the more volatile higher-frequency readings, has moved down since April, although it came in at 2.6 percent in July, again remaining well above our 2 percent goal. In addition, the latest consumer and producer price index reports suggest that 12\u00e2\u0080\u0091month core PCE inflation in August was likely a touch above the July reading. The persistently high core inflation largely reflects pressures on housing prices, perhaps due in part to low inventories of affordable housing. The progress in lowering inflation since April is a welcome development, but core inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee's 2 percent goal.\nPrices remain much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh on consumer sentiment. Higher prices have an outsized effect on lower- and moderate-income households, as these households devote a significantly larger share of income to food, energy, and housing. Prices for these spending categories have far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years.\nEconomic growth moderated earlier this year after coming in stronger last year. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP) growth has been solid and slowed much less than gross domestic product (GDP), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile categories including net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than GDP indicated. PDFP has continued to increase at a solid pace so far in the third quarter, despite some further weakening in housing activity, as retail sales have shown further robust gains in July and August.\nAlthough personal consumption has remained resilient, consumers appear to be pulling back on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant spending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have extra savings to support this type of spending, and we have seen loan delinquency rates normalize from historically low levels during the pandemic.\nThe most recent labor market report shows that payroll employment gains have slowed appreciably to a pace moderately above 100,000 per month over the three months ending in August. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.2 percent in August from 4.3 percent in July. While unemployment is notably higher than a year ago, it is still at a historically low level and below my and the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of full employment.\nThe labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined further to a touch below the historically elevated pre-pandemic level\u00e2\u0080\u0094a sign that the number of available workers and the number of available jobs have come into better balance. But there are still more available jobs than available workers, a condition that before 2018 has only occurred twice for a prolonged period since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength despite the reported data.\nAlthough wage growth has slowed further in recent months, it remains indicative of a tight labor market. At just under 4 percent, as measured by both the employment cost index and average hourly earnings, wage gains are still above the pace consistent with our inflation goal given trend productivity growth.\nThe rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs remain low. In addition to some cooling in labor demand, there are other factors likely contributing the increased unemployment. A mismatch between the skills of the new workers and available jobs could further raise unemployment, suggesting that higher unemployment has been partly driven by the stronger supply of workers. It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the recent rise in the unemployment rate, as unemployment among working age teenagers sharply increased in August.\nPreference for a More Measured Recalibration of Policy\nThe U.S. economy remains strong and core inflation remains uncomfortably above our 2 percent target. In light of these economic conditions, a few further considerations supported the case for a more measured approach in beginning the process to recalibrate our policy stance to remove restriction and move toward a more neutral setting.\nFirst, I was concerned that reducing the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point could be interpreted as a signal that the Committee sees some fragility or greater downside risks to the economy. In the current economic environment, with no clear signs of material weakening or fragility, in my view, beginning the rate-cutting cycle with a 1/4 percentage point move would have better reinforced the strength in economic conditions, while also confidently recognizing progress toward our goals. In my mind, a more measured approach would have avoided the risk of unintentionally signaling concerns about underlying economic conditions.\nSecond, I was also concerned that reducing the policy rate by 1/2 percentage point could have led market participants to expect that the Committee would lower the target range by that same pace at future meetings until the policy rate approaches a neutral level. If this expectation had materialized, we could have seen an unwarranted decline in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions could become overly accommodative. This outcome could work against the Committee's goal of returning inflation to our 2 percent target.\nI am pleased that Chair Powell directly addressed both of these concerns during the press conference following last week's FOMC meeting.\nThird, there continues to be a considerable amount of pent-up demand and cash on the sidelines ready to be deployed as the path of interest rates moves down. Bringing the policy rate down too quickly carries the risk of unleashing that pent-up demand. A more measured approach would also avoid unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures.\nFinally, in dialing back our restrictive stance of policy, we also need to be mindful of what the end point is likely to be. My estimate of the neutral rate is much higher than it was before the pandemic. Therefore, I think we are much closer to neutral than would have been the case under pre-pandemic conditions, and I did not see the peak stance of policy as restrictive to the same extent that my colleagues may have. With a higher estimate of neutral, for any given pace of rate reductions, we would arrive at our destination sooner.\nOngoing Risks to the Outlook\nTurning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market continues to be near estimates of full employment. Although the labor market data have been showing signs of cooling in recent months, still-elevated wage growth, solid consumer spending, and resilient GDP growth are not consistent with a material economic weakening or fragility. My contacts also continue to mention that they are not planning layoffs and continue to have difficulty hiring. Therefore, I am taking less signal from the recent labor market data until there are clear trends indicating that both spending growth and the labor market have materially weakened. I suspect the recent immigration flows have and will continue to affect labor markets in ways that we do not yet fully understand and cannot yet accurately measure. In light of the dissonance created by conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.\nIn my view, the upside risks to inflation remain prominent. Global supply chains continue to be susceptible to labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, which could result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. Expansionary fiscal spending could also lead to inflationary risks, as could an increased demand for housing given the long-standing limited supply, especially of affordable housing. While it has not been my baseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation could continue to stall.\nAlthough it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on lowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that the Committee's larger policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate. Accomplishing our mission of returning to low and stable inflation at our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term.\nIn light of these considerations, I believe that, by moving at a measured pace toward a more neutral policy stance, we will be better positioned to achieve further progress in bringing inflation down to our 2 percent target, while closely watching the evolution of labor market conditions.\nThe Path Forward\nDespite my dissent at the recent FOMC meeting, I respect and appreciate that my FOMC colleagues preferred to begin the reduction in the federal funds rate with a larger initial cut in the target range for the policy rate. I remain committed to working together with my colleagues to ensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our goals of attaining maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent target.\nI will continue to monitor the incoming data and information as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to adjusting the stance of policy going forward. It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. We need to ensure that the public understands clearly how current and expected deviations of inflation and employment from our mandated goals inform our policy decisions.\nBy the time of our next meeting in November, we will have received updated reports on inflation, employment, and economic activity. We may also have a better understanding of how developments in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions might influence the economic outlook.\nDuring the intermeeting period, I will continue to visit with a broad range of contacts to discuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As I noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as a concern. In light of the upside risks that I just described, it remains necessary to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate while being attentive to the risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view continues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run. However, should the data evolve in a way that points to a material weakening in the labor market, I would support taking action and adjust monetary policy as needed while taking into account our inflation mandate.\nClosing Thoughts\nIn closing, thank you again for welcoming me here today. It is a pleasure to join you and to have the opportunity to discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy. And given the recent FOMC meeting decision and my dissent, I appreciate being able to provide a more detailed explanation of the reasoning that led me to dissent in favor of a smaller reduction in the policy rate at last week's FOMC meeting.\nI look forward to answering your questions and to engaging with your members on bank regulatory and supervisory matters.\n1. The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors.\nReturn to text\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            September 24, 2024",

Bowman\nGovernor Michelle W. Bowman\nShare\nOn Wednesday, September 18, 2024, I dissented from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. As the Committee's post-meeting statement notes, I preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 5 to 5-1/4 percent.\nGiven the progress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market, I agree that at this meeting it was appropriate to recalibrate the level of the federal funds rate and begin the process of moving toward a more neutral policy stance. In my view, however, a smaller first move in this process would have been a preferable action.\nThe U.S. Economy Remains Strong\nThe U.S. economy remains strong, with solid underlying growth in economic activity and a labor market near full employment. Although hiring appears to have softened, layoffs remain low. I see the normalization in labor market conditions as necessary to help bring wage growth down to a pace consistent with 2 percent inflation given trend productivity growth. My reading of labor market data has become more uncertain due to increased measurement challenges and the inherent difficulty in assessing the effects of recent immigration flows. I am also taking signal from continued solid growth in the spending data, especially consumer spending, reflecting a healthy labor market.\nDespite Progress, Inflation Remains a Concern\nInflation remains above our 2 percent goal, as core personal consumption expenditures prices are still rising faster than 2.5 percent from 12 months earlier. Higher prices have an outsized impact on lower- and moderate-income households. Accomplishing our mission of returning to low and stable inflation at our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term.\nAlthough it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on lowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that the Committee's larger policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price stability mandate.\nWe have not yet achieved our inflation goal. I believe that moving at a measured pace toward a more neutral policy stance will ensure further progress in bringing inflation down to our 2 percent target. This approach would also avoid unnecessarily stoking demand.\nShared Goals for the Future\nDespite my dissent at our recent meeting, I respect and appreciate that my colleagues preferred to begin the reduction in the federal funds rate with a larger initial reduction in the target range for the policy rate. I remain committed to working together with my colleagues to ensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our goals of maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent target.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            September 20, 2024",

Bowman\nAt the Executive Council of the Banking Law Section of the Federal Bar Association, Washington, D.C\nShare\nThank you for the invitation to join you.\n1\nGiven the recent conclusion of the Board's stress test, it seems timely to share my thoughts on the stress testing program. In the past, I have noted reservations about the stress testing process, so today I'd like to discuss in greater detail the benefits, challenges, and issues I would like to see resolved as the stress testing program evolves in the future.\n2\nEarlier this summer, the Board announced the results of the supervisory stress tests. At a high level, all 31 banks subject to the test remained above their minimum common equity tier one (CET1) capital requirements from the hypothetical recession scenario.\n3\nUnder this scenario, banks would have absorbed projected hypothetical losses of nearly $685 billion, and would have experienced an aggregate CET1 capital decline of 2.8 percent.\n4\nThe hypothetical scenario included a 40 percent decline in commercial real estate prices, a substantial increase in office vacancies, a 36 percent decline in house prices, a spike in unemployment to a peak of 10 percent, and related declines in economic output.\n5\nThis year also saw the introduction of \"exploratory\" stress scenarios, which included two different funding stress scenarios, and for a subset of banks, included two trading book loss scenarios.\n6\nThe Board's press release announcing the results reported that large banks are well positioned to weather a severe recession and remain above minimum capital requirements.\n7\nMore recently, the Fed announced the final individual capital requirements for all large banks, effective on October 1, 2024.\n8\nThe firm-specific capital requirements are \"informed by\" the stress test results, and include a 4.5 percent minimum capital requirement, a stress capital buffer that is set at a minimum of 2.5 percent, and if applicable, a capital surcharge for the most complex banks that is based on each firm's systemic risk.\n9\nThe announcement of this year's results also noted the modification of the stress capital buffer for a single firm based on a reconsideration request. While firms subject to the stress test have long had the ability to request reconsideration\u00e2\u0080\u0094and many have done so in the past\u00e2\u0080\u0094this was notable as it was the first time that a reconsideration request was successful in producing a change to a firm's stress capital buffer.\nAs we conclude this most recent cycle of stress testing\u00e2\u0080\u0094and as many firms begin to turn to the next round\u00e2\u0080\u0094I think it is helpful to pause and consider whether and how the process could be improved. My remarks today will address the value of stress testing on bank safety and soundness and on financial stability, my concerns about the current implementation of the stress test, and finally what I see as a potential path forward. I hope this discussion leads to a broader consideration of stress testing, its role in the current prudential framework as a supervisory tool, and as a mechanism to set large bank capital standards through the stress capital buffer.\nThe Value of Stress Testing\nLet me start by emphasizing that my remarks today should not be interpreted as a wholesale criticism of the stress testing process and framework. I firmly believe that stress testing is and will remain a valuable mechanism that provides insights that can inform supervision and can inform the public about how the largest and most complex banks would fare under a severe stress scenario. This exercise helps us gauge a bank's capital position and determine whether it has sufficient capital to absorb losses and continue lending during an economic stress event.\nIn practice, stress testing provides a very granular assessment of a firm's risk, one that is more refined and risk-sensitive than capital standards alone. It relies on detailed balance sheet information\u00e2\u0080\u0094fixed at a particular date in the past\u00e2\u0080\u0094to do a deeper analysis of the firm's financial condition at that point in time. By subjecting this balance sheet to a hypothetical shock, we develop a better sense of not only the firm's risk, but also the firm's capacity to respond and adapt to changing economic conditions. This type of analysis would be impractical to conduct on a continuous basis, but it is a useful periodic supplement to ongoing capital requirements and can be used to support more robust supervisory practices.\nThe Need for Reform\nWhile there are many virtues of stress testing, as currently implemented and executed there are several significant drawbacks. These drawbacks arguably make the process less fair, transparent, and useful than it could and should be.\nI have long supported and argued in favor of fairness and transparency in the bank regulatory framework.\n10\nThe rules and supervisory practices that comprise this framework should be consistent among firms, and consistent over time. Banks should have a clear understanding of these rules to allow them to make informed business decisions that consider the impact of the regulatory framework. But we also know that the diversity and variability of bank business models can present a challenge to the clarity of the framework. Clarity is needed both to promote equitable treatment among banks with different business models, and to create rules that are fair over time. This allows firms to anticipate regulatory expectations as their business activities and balance sheets evolve in response to, among other things, changing economic conditions. Each bank is unique, and one need look no further than the balance sheets, business activities, and risk profiles of large banks to observe this variability. But the onus is on regulators to ensure that over time, regulations and supervisory practices are applied fairly and consistently, and that evolution in the framework is accompanied by appropriate transparency for regulated entities.\nThe challenge of creating rules that are fair and transparent is nowhere more notable than in stress testing. Stress testing serves an important role in our regulatory framework, but one that requires evolution to ensure relevancy and effectiveness. To date, the evolution of stress testing has focused on refining the tests to be more robust over time and to provide more granular risk information about these banks. While these incremental improvements have been helpful, the task of addressing identified problems is equally important.\nTo be clear, these problems extend beyond model accuracy and consistency across firms. While by no means a comprehensive list, I would like to address four of my concerns in particular: (1) volatility in firm results from year to year, (2) the challenge of linking stress testing outcomes with capital through the stress capital buffer, (3) the broad lack of transparency, and (4) the overlap with other capital requirements like the overlap between the global market shock in stress testing and the market risk rule under the Basel III endgame proposal.\nVolatility\nOne area of particular concern is the year-over-year volatility in stress testing results. Many of the stress test design features are intended to promote consistency across firms\u00e2\u0080\u0094the exercise uses a common scenario design, and subjects similarly situated firms to stress testing at the same frequency. This format allows for comparisons across firms and can provide important supervisory insights as regulators can look across firms to find common risk factors that could affect multiple firms\u00e2\u0080\u0094and lead to more significant and widespread economic impacts\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a stress event. But we have seen that stress test results for several firms vary considerably from year to year based on the interaction of the specific scenario being tested with a firm's business model, changes to the model, and each firm's balance sheet. This variability then flows through to the stress capital buffers that apply to the largest firms.\n11\nSome variability is to be expected as the risk factors and balance sheet composition of the tested firms both change over time. However, the test results observed year over year often produce results that are not predictable in advance\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, some of the volatility we see is not based on fundamental changes to a tested bank's business model.\nThe link between stress testing and capital also creates a practical timing issue for firms. The time frame for compliance with stress capital buffers compounds the issue of excessive year-over-year volatility. While many capital requirements give firms a runway to comply and adjust capital planning projections going forward, stress capital buffers allow a very brief window of time for firms to comply.\n12\nAs a real-time example, this year's preliminary stress capital buffer requirements were announced in late June, with required compliance by October 1st.\nThis concern is experienced differently across firms\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, some firms can likely predict that they will be subject to the stress capital buffer \"floor,\" which perhaps can help with longer-term capital planning. But for those firms whose stress capital buffers exceed the floor, this short turnaround can pose significant planning challenges. Although banks historically have not been required to raise capital to meet higher stress capital buffer results, volatility is not a nonissue. As a matter of practice, banks maintain management buffers\u00e2\u0080\u0094additional capital in excess of capital and regulatory buffer requirements\u00e2\u0080\u0094to ensure that they operate at levels significantly above the \"well-capitalized\" threshold. Unexpectedly steep increases in stress capital buffers may force firms to recalibrate or reconsider their management buffer, perhaps operating at a higher level than would otherwise be necessary to account for known volatility in stress capital buffers over time.\nThis variability is not without cost. Firms engage in capital planning over a long-term planning horizon. Significant variability can disrupt these practices and require firms to hold more capital and higher capital management buffers than prudent business practices would indicate.\nThe link between stress testing and capital\u00e2\u0080\u0094the stress capital buffer\nAs currently implemented, the stress test exercise presents a single hypothetical shock to a firm's balance sheet, with the goal of better understanding firm performance and risks in the face of this stress. But the test is not intended to be\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor is it in practice\u00e2\u0080\u0094\npredictive\nof an actual stress event that the firm would experience. During the banking stress of 2023, the key risk factor was rapidly rising interest rates, and yet this type of economic stressor was not included in any past iteration of the test design.\nWhy do we select one scenario and use that hypothetical to establish binding capital requirements for many firms regardless of their business model? What incentives does this system create as regulators design scenarios?\nUnquestionably, stress testing can provide valuable insights to inform supervision. Testing multiple stress scenarios could provide additional information that could be used to probe the unique risks and resilience of particular firms. And it could provide regulators and the public with a clearer understanding of financial stability risks across firms under different plausible future states of the world.\nBut a more robust use of stress testing would require rationalizing the link between stress testing and capital to ensure that any change in overall calibration was driven by an intentional process that results in a reasonable policy outcome. As a practical matter, testing additional scenarios raises the question of what consequences should flow from a multi-scenario testing regime. Would such an approach\nrequire\nacross-the-board capital increases, as regulators calibrate stress capital buffers based on the most severe outcome of any tested scenario for each firm? Or should regulators pick a common scenario to calibrate stress capital buffers for all firms, even in a multi-scenario stress testing regime? Or should regulators take a different approach and sever the link between stress testing and capital requirements?\nThe link between stress testing and capital raises important policy questions about the optimal level of capital, but ultimately should not dissuade us from using stress testing to better understand firm-specific and broader financial stability risks. At the same time, we need to pay careful attention to the design of all capital requirements\u00e2\u0080\u0094including not just the stress capital buffer, but also other risk-based capital requirements, leverage requirements, and long-term debt requirements\u00e2\u0080\u0094to ensure that the overall calibration of these requirements is proportionate to risk. In my view, an up-calibration of capital requirements through an expanded scenario-testing regime would not be supportable based on the underlying risks.\nTransparency\nOne persistent issue with the stress tests is the lack of public transparency around the models. This opacity frustrates bank capital management and allocation. When a bank engages in an activity or prices a product or service, as a sound business practice, they must anticipate the financial consequences and the accompanying risks. Before making any decisions, a bank will often try to project the anticipated costs and revenues. In addition, the bank will want to evaluate the projected growth of the business or activity over time, determine whether the activity complements other existing products and services, and decide whether there will be sufficient customer demand to justify the cost based on the contemplated pricing levels and margins. One important consideration in this exercise is the cost of capital. Banks often quantify the cost of capital and \"allocate\" those costs across various business lines.\nThe capital requirements and supervisory risk assessment of activities are important inputs for bank decision-making. Banks benefit when they understand the regulatory perception of their activities. That feedback is often a critical part of the supervisory process. A regulatory perspective is embedded in stress testing, through the common parameters, assumptions, and conditions that will be used in the exercises. But much of this work remains hidden from public scrutiny and from the financial institutions subject to the stress tests. Providing access to this information\u00e2\u0080\u0094making clear the regulatory perspective\u00e2\u0080\u0094by improving the transparency of the process would enable banks to better manage their business and make more informed decisions.\nOf course, greater disclosure is not without its detractors.

Barr\nAt the Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for inviting me to speak today.\n1\nSince I joined the Federal Reserve Board as Vice Chair for Supervision, I have spoken many times about the importance of bank capital to the safety and soundness of banks and the stability of the financial system.\n2\nIt is critical that banks have the capacity to continue lending to households and businesses through times of stress. Bank capital is a key component of this resilience. And bank capital rules help to ensure that banks are holding capital commensurate with the risks of their activities and the risks that they pose to the U.S. financial system. But capital has costs too. As compared to debt, capital is a more expensive source of funding to the bank.\n3\nThus, higher capital requirements can raise the cost of funding to a bank, and the bank can pass higher costs on to households, businesses, and clients engaged in a range of financial activities. These activities are critical to a well-functioning economy that works for everyone. That's why it is important to get the balance between resiliency and efficiency right.\nToday, I'll return to these themes in the context of two rules of great public interest: The Basel III endgame proposal and the proposal to adjust the capital surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIB).\n4\nThe path forward\nA little over a year ago, the Board sought comment on those two proposed rules, which would modify risk-based capital requirements for large banks. We received a great number of comments on the provisions in the proposal, as well as on the justifications and analysis that underlie those provisions.\nSince that time, we have been hard at work analyzing the comments and the data we collected to evaluate the combined impact of these proposals. We have spoken with a wide range of stakeholders, including banks, academics, public interest groups, consumers, businesses, other regulators, Congress, and others. As you would expect in a project as technical and consequential as this one, I have had many productive meetings with Board colleagues and our fellow federal bank regulatory agencies, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).\nThis process has led us to conclude that broad and material changes to the proposals are warranted. As I said, there are benefits and costs to increasing capital requirements. The changes we intend to make will bring these two important objectives into better balance, in light of the feedback we have received. The changes to the endgame proposal have been a joint effort with my counterparts at the FDIC and the OCC.\nI intend to recommend that the Board re-propose the Basel endgame and G-SIB surcharge rules. This will provide the public the opportunity to fully review a number of key broad and material changes to the original proposals and provide comment. We will accept public comments on any aspect of the Basel endgame and G-SIB surcharge proposals.\nThe changes in the endgame re-proposal will cover all major areas of the rule: credit risk; operational risk; and market risk. Banks with assets between $100 and $250 billion would no longer be subject to the endgame changes, other than the requirement to recognize unrealized gains and losses of their securities in regulatory capital.\n5\nThese changes reflect the feedback we have received from the public, improve the tiering of the proposal, and better reflect risks. I will also recommend changes to the G-SIB surcharge proposal to better align the capital surcharge for a G-SIB with its systemic risk profile.\nTaken together, the re-proposals would increase aggregate common equity tier 1 capital requirements for the G-SIBs, which are the largest and most complex banks, by 9 percent. For other large banks that are not G-SIBs, the impact from the re-proposal would mainly result from the inclusion of unrealized gain and losses on their securities in regulatory capital, estimated to be equivalent to a 3 to 4 percent increase in capital requirements over the long run. The remainder of the re-proposal would increase capital requirements for non-GSIB firms still subject to the rule by 0.5 percent.\nWhile these proposed changes affect some of the most important aspects of the proposals, the agencies have not made final decisions on any aspect of the re-proposals, including those that are not explicitly addressed in the re-proposal. The public should not view any omission of a potential change in these re-proposals as an indication that the agencies will finalize a provision as proposed. We continue to consider comments already received on the 2023 proposal, and we will consider those comments together with any comments submitted on the re-proposals as part of any final rulemakings. This is an interim step. Let me reiterate that we are open to comments on any aspect of the proposals. Now, I will turn to the changes.\nCredit risk\nI will begin with an overview of the changes I will recommend to the capital requirements for credit risk, which protect against the risk that a bank's loans will not be fully repaid. These changes include reducing the risk-weights for residential real estate and retail exposures, extending the scope of the reduced risk weight for certain low-risk corporate debt, and eliminating the minimum haircut for securities financing transactions.\nFirst, I intend to recommend that the Board lower the proposed risk-weighting for loans secured by residential real estate and loans to retail customers. The original proposal introduced more risk-sensitive approaches for residential real estate and retail exposures, but calibrated them to be higher than the Basel standard to promote domestic competitive equity. The agencies received significant comments on the proposed calibrations. Some commenters argued that the elevated risk weights would overstate the risk for these loans given their loss history. Others argued that the risk weighting would affect home affordability and homeownership opportunities, particularly for first-time homebuyers, minority communities, and low- and moderate-income borrowers, and could reduce the availability and affordability of retail credit.\nI will recommend that we reduce the calibration for residential real estate exposures so that it is in line with the calibration developed in the Basel process. With this change, all-in capital requirements, including for operational and credit risk, will be lower on average than they are currently for mortgages up to 90 percent loan-to-value ratio, and about the same as they are now for mortgages up to 100 percent loan-to-value. With respect to loans to retail customers, I intend to recommend that we adopt the Basel standard, with two exceptions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 first, we would lower the capital requirements for credit card exposures where the borrower uses only a small portion of the commitment line, and second, we would lower the capital requirement for charge cards with no pre-set credit limits.\nThe second proposed change related to credit risk would extend the reduced risk weight for low-risk corporate exposures to certain regulated entities that a bank judges to be investment grade and that are not publicly traded. The original proposal provided this preferential treatment only to investment-grade corporates that were publicly traded because the financial disclosure requirements for these entities facilitate market participants' assessments of their financial condition, which in turn provide additional information for banking organizations to use when assessing these entities' credit risk. There were many comments that the preferential treatment should be extended further, including to regulated entities that are also subject to substantial regulatory discipline and substantial transparency requirements. Consistent with our objective of increasing risk sensitivity in capital requirements, I plan to recommend to the Board that we extend the reduced corporate risk weight to regulated entities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including regulated financial institutions that are not banks, such as pension funds, certain mutual funds, and foreign equivalents \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that are investment-grade but not publicly traded.\nThird, I intend to recommend that the Board not adopt the capital treatment associated with minimum haircut floors for securities financing transactions. The proposal included heightened capital requirements for repo-style transactions and eligible margin loans that did not meet minimum margin requirements. While consistent with the Basel standard, several other major jurisdictions have not adopted this approach. Not adopting the minimum haircut floors will allow time to seek greater international consensus on this important topic before deciding on whether and how to implement such an approach in the United States.\nEquity Exposures\nLet me speak to the treatment of tax credit equity financing exposures. I plan to recommend that we significantly lower the risk weight for tax credit equity funding structures, given the lower inherent risk in these structures compared to many other equity investments. The revised lower risk weight for these exposures of 100 percent would reflect this lower risk and be consistent with the approach we take for other tax credit investments, such as the low-income housing tax credits.\nOperational risk\nNext, let me speak about three changes I intend to recommend for the proposed capital treatment of operational risk, which is the risk of losses from inadequate or failed processes, such as from fraud or cyberattacks. First, I plan to recommend that we no longer adjust a firm's operational risk charge based on its operational loss history. This change will reduce fluctuations in a bank's operational risk capital requirements over time.\nSecond, I plan to recommend to the Board that we calculate fee income on a net basis in calculating its contribution to the operational risk capital requirement. The original proposal would have measured the contribution of fee-based activities based on gross revenues, instead of net income, which is revenues minus expenses. Moving to net income for fee-based activities\u00e2\u0080\u0094specifically, by netting noninterest income and expenses (except for operational losses)\u00e2\u0080\u0094would produce more consistency in how operational risk is measured across bank activities, as interest and trading income and expenses are already measured on a net basis under the proposal. This change would also produce more consistent operational risk capital requirements across banks because the approach is less sensitive to the differences in accounting practices across banks.\nThird, I plan to recommend to the Board that we reduce operational risk capital requirements for investment management activities to reflect the smaller historical operational losses for these activities relative to income. The agencies received comments suggesting that some fee-based business lines have incurred meaningfully lower operational losses than other business lines. We have found evidence that investment management has historically experienced noticeably low operational losses relative to income produced.\nMarket risk and derivatives\nNow, I'll speak to the capital treatment for a bank's trading activities and its derivatives activities. The endgame proposal included a number of important improvements relative to the current market risk capital framework, including to incorporate lessons learned from the 2007-09 financial crisis that have not been sufficiently addressed in the current framework. It would permit firms to use internal models to capture the complex dynamics of most market risks but would put certain constraints on banks' models and provide fallbacks in areas where modeling practices are not adequate.\nWe received numerous comments on ways to improve this part of the proposal. I plan to recommend that we make changes to facilitate banks' ability to use internal models for market risk. For example, the re-proposal will introduce a multiyear implementation period for the profit and loss attribution tests that are used to confirm that models are working as intended. This extended transition period would allow banks to gain experience with the tests and provide time to improve their systems and processes and address any potential gaps in data and model performance. In addition, the re-proposal would contain a few additional adjustments to improve incentives for a firm to model its exposures.\nMoreover, we will clarify that uniform mortgage-backed securities positions would be treated as having a single obligor, regardless of whether they were issued by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. This change will enable firms to recognize hedging across these securities.\nWith respect to derivatives activities, I plan to recommend that the Board adjust the capital treatment for client-cleared derivatives activities by reducing the capital required for the client-facing leg of a client-cleared derivative. This change would better reflect the risks of these transactions, which are highly collateralized and subject to netting and daily margin requirements. This also would avoid disincentives to client clearing, which I'll return to later.\nTiering\nLet me turn to tiering. The largest, most complex firms should be subject to the most stringent requirements, in light of the costs that their potential failure would impose on the broader financial system and thus on businesses and households. Under the re-proposal, G-SIBs and other internationally active banks would be subject to the most stringent set of requirements, including the new credit risk and operational risk requirements, and the revised frameworks for market risk and CVA frameworks.\nCapital requirements for large banks that are not G-SIBs can be simpler while still supporting resilience. I am recommending a number of changes to better reflect this principle. For firms with assets between $250 and $700 billion that are not G-SIBs or internationally active, the re-proposal would apply the new credit risk and operational risk requirements; however, it would apply the frameworks for market risk and CVA frameworks only to firms that engage in significant trading activity. Further, the re-proposal would revert to the simpler definition of capital \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the numerator in the capital ratio \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for these firms that is currently in place, with the exception of applying the requirement to reflect unrealized losses and gains on certain securities and other aspects of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). The re-proposal would maintain this element to better reflect interest rate risk in capital, a problem that played a major ",

Waller\nAt the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Eric, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nMy topic is the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy, a set of judgements that have, of course, been influenced by this morning's jobs report. When I scheduled this speech several months ago, I knew it might be challenging to speak a few hours after the release of such an important piece of data. But we like to say that monetary policy must be nimble, so that means policymakers must be nimble also. Not\nSimone Biles nimble\n, but nimble. As you will hear, I believe the data we have received this week reinforces the view that there has been continued moderation in the labor market. In light of the considerable and ongoing progress toward the Federal Open Market Committee's 2 percent inflation goal, I believe that the balance of risks has shifted toward the employment side of our dual mandate, and that monetary policy needs to adjust accordingly.\nLooking back at the economic data over the first six months of 2024, it portrayed an economy slowly cooling and not showing signs of significant weakening. The labor market had been gradually moderating for the past year or so, and although inflation rose in the first quarter, it then retreated in the second, and there was a widespread view heading into the second half of the year that the FOMC was on track to achieve a much desired but unusual \"soft landing.\"\nThen the July jobs report came in unexpectedly soft. Job creation slowed and the unemployment rate increased by two tenths of a percentage point to 4.3 percent, the highest since October 2021. There was speculation that weather-related issues might have distorted these results and, in fact, the unemployment rate ticked down in this morning's release. But, overall, the August report along with other recent labor data tend to confirm that there has been a continued moderation in the labor market.\nThe ups and downs in the data over time highlight what I consider the right approach to meeting the FOMC's dual mandate goals\u00e2\u0080\u0094I believe we should be data dependent, but not overreact to any data point, including the latest data. When we faced a period of banking instability in the spring of 2023, there were calls from some to stop rate hikes despite inflation still running over 5 percent. But there were other tools in hand to deal with that stress, monetary policy did not overreact, and the FOMC continued tightening policy. When inflation fell unexpectedly in the second half of last year, we did not overreact and immediately cut the policy rate. Then when inflation accelerated in the first quarter, we did not overreact and raise rates despite some calls to do so. I will be looking at these last two employment reports in combination with all other data as we head into the September FOMC meeting to decide the best stance of policy. I believe our patience over the past 18 months has served us well. But the current batch of data no longer requires patience, it requires action.\nToday's jobs report continues the longer-term pattern of a softening of the labor market that is consistent with moderate growth in economic activity, the details of which I will get into in a moment. As I said at the outset, considering the progress we have made on getting inflation back to target, I believe that the balance of risks is now weighted more toward downside risks to the FOMC's maximum-employment mandate.\nWhile the labor market has clearly cooled, based on the evidence I see, I do not believe the economy is in a recession or necessarily headed for one soon. The collective set of economic data indicates to me that the labor market and the economy are performing in a solid manner and the prospects for continued growth and job creation are good, with inflation near 2 percent. I continue to believe that this can occur without substantial harm to the labor market. But I also believe that maintaining the economy's forward momentum means that, as Chair Powell said recently, the time has come to begin reducing the target range for the federal funds rate.\nIn the rest of my remarks, I will lay out my reasons for believing that the economy and employment will likely keep growing as inflation moves toward 2 percent. The first of these is the large body of evidence that economic activity is continuing to grow at a solid pace. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the first half of this year and recent data indicates that growth is continuing at around this pace in the third quarter.\nRetail sales were stronger than expected in July and showed that households continue to spend as their finances, in the aggregate, remain healthy. The increase was fairly broad based across goods categories. While many online retailers offered discounts last month, this was not a dominant factor in the solid results. Although manufacturing output fell in July and the August Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey pointed to weak production and new orders, the similar survey for the larger, nonmanufacturing sector was consistent with a modest expansion of activity.\nAs for the labor market, on balance, the data that we have received in the past three days indicates to me that the labor market is continuing to soften but not deteriorate, and this judgement is important to our upcoming decision on monetary policy. As I said earlier, Wednesday's report on job openings in July was consistent with a moderating labor market. Meanwhile, the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance has risen gradually since January but has changed little on net in the past two months, with initial claims remaining fairly low.\nThe jobs report for August, released this morning, supported the story of ongoing moderation in the labor market. After rising to 4.3 percent in July, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2 percent in August. Taking a longer perspective, the unemployment rate over the past 16 months has increased gradually but fairly steadily from 3.4 percent to 4.2 percent in today's release. Payrolls rose by 142,000 in August compared with 89,000 in July, leaving the three-month average payroll gain at 116,000, compared with the 267,000 average in the first quarter and 147,000 in the second. Accounting for revisions to the jobs numbers that we received in August, that level is a bit below what I see as the breakeven pace for job creation that absorbs new entrants to the workforce and keeps the unemployment rate constant.\n2\nJuly marked the first time that the three-month average unemployment rate has increased by at least a half of a percentage point above its 12-month low, which was 3.6 percent in July 2023. This breached a threshold established by the Sahm rule, which observes that when this has occurred in the past, it has been a reliable indicator of the economy entering a recession.\nWhile this is a correlation that certainly bears attention, I want to make a few cautionary points about relying on such rules in deciding that a recession has begun. As we have seen in the recent past with other supposedly reliable recession rules, such as an inverted yield curve, there is more to forecasting economic outcomes than the relationships between a couple of variables.\nFirst, these rules are nothing more than a mechanical, statistical description of past economic outcomes\u00e2\u0080\u0094they do not seek to explain what economic forces drive the relationship between the data, nor are they based on the totality of economic data. All recessions rules do is pick up a correlation between movements in economic data and the dates of recessions or other outcomes. A second point is that, setting aside the unusual circumstances of the 1981\u00e2\u0080\u009382 recession, recessions occur when a major shock hits the economy.\n3\nIn the absence of a big negative shock, an inversion of the yield curve or a triggering of the Sahm rule doesn't necessarily mean we are entering a recession.\nThird, recession rules typically pick up demand-driven recessions. But this is not why unemployment is rising now. GDP forecasts for the current quarter all show solid growth, labor market data show lay off rates are stable, and consumer spending is growing at a healthy rate. These data suggest demand is fairly strong. Instead, most of the increase in the unemployment rate is from workers entering the labor force and not finding jobs right away. So, the recent rise in the unemployment rate appears to be more of a supply-side-driven phenomenon, not demand driven.\nAnd lastly, it should be clear to everyone that many pre-pandemic economic relationships have not proven to be good policy guides post-pandemic. Reliance on old lessons from inverted yield curves to predict a recession, a Phillips curve to predict inflation, or a flat Beveridge curve to predict the movement in the unemployment rate have all led to mistaken economic forecasts.\nWhile I don't see the recent data pointing to a recession, I do see some downside risk to employment that I will be watching closely. But at this point, I believe there is substantial evidence that the economy retains the strength and momentum to keep growing, supported by an appropriate loosening of monetary policy.\nLet me now turn to the outlook for inflation. With the labor market cooling, it doesn't surprise me that wage growth has slowed to a pace consistent with the FOMC's price-stability goal, and this is supporting ongoing progress toward that objective. The employment cost index grew at an annualized rate of 3.5 percent from March to June, and the 12-month change was 3.9 percent for private sector workers, the lowest since late 2021.\n4\nAverage hourly earnings, reported in today's jobs report, rose at a three-month annualized pace of 3.8 percent in August, the same as the 12-month change.\nInflation in July continued to show progress toward the FOMC's goal. The price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Committee's preferred inflation measure, increased at a monthly pace of 0.2 percent in July for both total and core PCE inflation. Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is a good guide to underlying inflation, and it increased 2.7 percent over the past 12 months. Given the downward trajectory of monthly readings, I also look at the 6- and 3-month annualized rate. These stand at 2.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. These numbers are good news and suggest that our restrictive policy stance has put us on the right path to attain our 2 percent inflation target.\nLooking across the components of inflation, one can see the breadth of the disinflation. Over 50 percent of categories in the total and core market baskets had annualized monthly inflation less than 2.5 percent in August. In fact, the index of core goods prices has reverted to its historical pattern of slight deflation, reflecting normalized supply after the disruptions of the pandemic as well as ongoing technological and productivity advances. Meanwhile, services price inflation has slowed as wage growth has slowed, since labor is a large input for much of the service sector. Overall, I see significant and ongoing progress toward the FOMC's inflation goal that I expect will continue over the remainder of this year.\nNow let me discuss the implications of this outlook for monetary policy. As I said at the outset, considering the achieved and continuing progress on inflation and moderation in the labor market, I believe the time has come to lower the target range for the federal funds rate at our upcoming meeting. Reducing the policy rate now is consistent with many versions of the Taylor rule, which suggest reducing the policy rate is appropriate given the data in hand.\nFurthermore, I do not expect this first cut to be the last. With inflation and employment near our longer-run goals and the labor market moderating, it is likely that a series of reductions will be appropriate. I believe there is sufficient room to cut the policy rate and still remain somewhat restrictive to ensure inflation continues on the path to our 2 percent target.\nDetermining the appropriate pace at which to reduce policy restrictiveness will be challenging. Choosing a slower pace of rate cuts gives time to gradually assess whether the neutral rate has in fact risen, but at the risk of moving too slowly and putting the labor market at risk. Cutting the policy rate at a faster pace means a greater likelihood of achieving a soft landing but at the risk of overshooting on rate cuts if the neutral rate has in fact risen above its pre-pandemic level. This would cause an undesired loosening of monetary policy.\nDetermining the pace of rate cuts and ultimately the total reduction in the policy rate are decisions that lie in the future. As of today, I believe it is important to start the rate cutting process at our next meeting. If subsequent data show a significant deterioration in the labor market, the FOMC can act quickly and forcefully to adjust monetary policy. I am open-minded about the size and pace of cuts, which will be based on what the data tell us about the evolution of the economy, and not on any pre-conceived notion of how and when the Committee should act. If the data supports cuts at consecutive meetings, then I believe it will be appropriate to cut at consecutive meetings. If the data suggests the need for larger cuts, then I will support that as well. I was a big advocate of front-loading rate hikes when inflation accelerated in 2022, and I will be an advocate of front-loading rate cuts if that is appropriate. Those decisions will be determined by new data and how it adds to the totality of the data and shapes my understanding of economic conditions. While I expect that these cuts will be done carefully as the economy and employment continue to grow, in the context of stable inflation, I stand ready to act promptly to support the economy as needed.\n1.

Waller\nAt the Global Fintech Fest, Mumbai, India\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you to the conference organizers for the opportunity to speak this year at the Global Fintech Fest\u00e2\u0080\u0094a place where there is so much payments innovation.\n1\nThe technology-driven payments revolution in India has been enabled by a public-private partnership to build the \"technology stack\" of digital platforms that has broadened financial inclusion and done so at low costs.\n2\nBuilding on the foundation established by the public sector, innovators in the private sector seized the opportunity to enhance payments through the introduction of new capabilities that alleviate frictions while remaining within regulatory guardrails. In today's remarks, I am going to touch on how interplay between the public and private sectors may be the key to advancing cross-border payments.\nNow that fast payment systems have been established around much of the globe\u00e2\u0080\u0094in over 70 countries and climbing\u00e2\u0080\u0094attention is turning to how these newer systems could potentially enhance global payments. Specifically, interlinking fast payment systems has been identified as a possible means to deliver enhanced cross-border payments for consumers and businesses. Interlinking arrangements would allow banks in different countries who are users of domestic fast payment systems to send payments to each other through technical connections between their respective domestic systems. As you all know, interlinking is one of the areas outlined in the G20 roadmap for further exploration as part of a holistic effort to enhance cross-border payments. The overarching G20 goal is to mitigate challenges with cross-border payments in a coordinated way at a global level, with input from key stakeholders including the private sector.\nThe G20 roadmap addresses a new topic that payments industry stakeholders have been circling around for years\u00e2\u0080\u0094more cost-effective and timely cross-border payments for consumers and businesses. This policy goal has been advanced by the Federal Reserve over time in various payment system improvement initiatives, dating back to the late 1990s when the Federal Reserve began adapting the automated clearinghouse (ACH) service to support international payments, and more recently in 2015 when we collaborated with industry to improve the payment system.\n3\nToday's consumers and businesses can generally send a payment anywhere in the world, but they all seem to want faster and cheaper global payments, just like we always want faster flights and cheaper airfares. However, I am not entirely convinced that interlinking arrangements will necessarily deliver on those goals. Let me explain with some context.\nFaster and cheaper cross-border payments\nNot all frictions that slow payments down are bad. Certain frictions are purposely built into the global payment system for compliance and risk-management reasons. Slowing down the speed at which payments are cleared and settled helps banks prevent money laundering and counter the financing of terrorism, detect fraud, and recover fraudulent or misdirected cross-border payments. Granted, the practice today of sending payments through an often complex chain of correspondent banks contributes to slower payments that could benefit from efficiency enhancements. However, there is no silver bullet that increases speed and efficiency without tradeoffs. Unless new solutions are found, interlinking fast payment systems might increase the risk-management burden for banks that participate in them. That is, legal, compliance, and operational considerations are critical to the discussion of the promise and challenges of interlinking. Governance, oversight, and settlement arrangements also need to be thought through, along with considerations for data privacy.\nIn addition, can we assume that all parties to a cross-border transaction want faster payments? The fundamental friction in any transaction is that the seller of an object\u00e2\u0080\u0094a can of soup, an hour of labor, or a good manufactured for export\u00e2\u0080\u0094wants to receive their money as fast as possible. However, the buyer of the object, or the buyer's intermediary, typically has an incentive to wait as long as they can to pay for something they have purchased. Under this logic, senders need to be properly incentivized to speed up cross-border payments. The one exception may be person-to-person remittances, where workers from other countries want to send money home, and recipients want access, as fast as possible. But remittances are only a small percentage of the value of cross-border payments, so we'd need to weigh the benefits against the costs of a potential public-sector intervention to shift incentives. So, I am still left with the larger question of whether we should be incentivizing faster cross-border payments.\nSuppose we do want to incentivize senders by lowering costs of faster payments\u00e2\u0080\u0094whose responsibility is it to do that? Should it be left to private-sector competition to drive down costs as is typically the case with other products? Or is there something unique about payments that requires central banks or payment system operators to step in to interlink their networks with the goal of bringing costs down? We have already seen examples of the private sector leveraging technology to innovate in the market for cross-border instant payments, both at the wholesale and retail level. For example, we have seen a real-time payment system built for wholesale clients that allows clearing and settlement between global clients in seconds, with necessary compliance performed upfront in less than 24 hours. Another example is the SWIFT Global Payments Innovation, which offers improved speed and transparency for the business customers of participating banks, and, by their account, has been adopted by 150 banks globally. In mentioning these examples, I am not intending to endorse certain private-sector services. Rather, these newer services are illustrative of how market forces and competition can meet consumer and business demands for more efficient cross-border payments.\nIn the United States we have experience with offering low-cost international ACH payments. We provided direct ACH linkages from the United States to Europe and Canada, but after more than 20 years, the banks were not using it, and we stopped the service. It is possible that a fast payment interlinking arrangement adopted by Federal Reserve would be more effective for our bank customers than the former ACH service, but we would proceed cautiously to carefully consider the costs and benefits. Economic viability needs to be a cornerstone for any action we may take. We need to ask ourselves whether banks would find a central bank interlinking service more effective than their existing arrangements for cross-border payments, and if they would actually use it.\nPractical aspects of interlinking fast payment systems\nWe know from basic economic theory that payment systems are similar to other networks in that greater participation is necessary for the network to grow and increase value to its users. This is true on a global scale, too, which in practical terms means that valuable global interlinked networks would have to be founded on underlying domestic networks with a breadth of senders and receivers. Domestic networks need to be developed first. If this condition is not in place, interlinked networks could end up being a road to nowhere.\nBuilding out domestic networks has been done in different ways. In some countries the central bank has authority to mandate participation, notably in Brazil with the successful Pix system. In other countries, notably India, united efforts by the government, central bank, and private sector established the digital public infrastructure that enabled broad adoption.\nIn the United States, it's a different story, and the payments landscape is unique. With over 9,000 depository institutions and different authorities than other countries, the Federal Reserve determined that it needed to build a fast payment system accessible to all depository institutions to achieve our policy goals. At the time of our decision, there was only one private-sector instant payment system in the market, built by the largest banks. Based on our experience, we did not believe that this system would ultimately reach all depository institutions, nor would other private-sector systems emerge to compete with it and extend the scope of that service. Yet we knew from industry engagement that smaller banks across the country wanted a broadly accessible fast payment system, so we stepped in to address the clear coordination problem. This action is very much consistent with the Federal Reserve's role in the U.S. payment system historically.\nWe have seen widespread adoption of the FedNow Service in just a little over a year since implementation, with close to 1,000 depository institutions on the network including many of the largest banks that will drive origination volume. Yet we are still at the beginning of a multiyear journey of establishing a ubiquitous network covering the majority of institutions in our country. Variation around the world in domestic fast payment network adoption means that the value of globally interlinked systems is not yet clear.\nFrom a technical perspective, the promise of interlinking, which is essentially interoperability between or among domestic fast payment systems, is that fast payment networks can just \"connect\"' with each other and move payments globally. It sounds simple. In practice, however, achieving interoperability is not simple. Technology is probably the easiest part. The legal, compliance, settlement, and governance challenges I mentioned earlier are more substantial. In addition, even when technological connections are in place, payments may not actually be instant as they traverse across systems because of domestic variations in ISO 20022 implementation, which is the global standard used by most fast payment systems. To send an ISO message seamlessly from one country to another across a technical link, operators need to coordinate and align on common practices.\nWe should consider that new multilateral arrangements for interlinking could potentially address some of the challenges that I have outlined. Today, certain countries have established bilateral links between domestic fast payment systems primarily to support remittance payments. These arrangements demonstrate that linkages are technically possible and that legal and compliance issues can be addressed. Yet each link is unique and requires resource-intensive negotiation and alignment between parties. Establishing bilateral links across the globe simply will not scale. We know this to be true from our own bilateral ACH linkages, where each arrangement required bespoke agreements with correspondent banks and service providers. Multilateral arrangements might bring some efficiencies, yet they are no small undertaking.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, overall, I do see the value of a coordination role for the public sector to improve cross-border payments, an effort in which the Federal Reserve has been and will continue to be heavily engaged. We will continue our engagement with international fora to improve the speed and efficiency of cross-border payments and to investigate the issues critical to interlinking payment systems. Our chief focus in the near-to mid-term, however, is continuing to build the FedNow network domestically and increasing participation in the service. We are also improving existing cross-border rails by considering expanded operating hours on our large-value, real-time gross settlement system, the Fedwire Funds Service, and by adopting ISO 20022, a globally accepted messaging standard. Looking out over the longer term, we will continue to conduct research and experimentation on emerging technologies to better understand the role these innovations could play in the payments landscape of the future. I expect the technical capabilities, legal infrastructure, and use cases for faster cross-border payments will evolve, and I look forward to following the private-sector innovation that will emerge from stakeholders represented at this event.\n1.

Powell\nAt \u00e2\u0080\u009cReassessing the Effectiveness and Transmission of Monetary Policy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an economic symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming\nShare\nWatch Live\nFour and a half years after COVID-19's arrival, the worst of the pandemic-related economic distortions are fading. Inflation has declined significantly. The labor market is no longer overheated, and conditions are now less tight than those that prevailed before the pandemic. Supply constraints have normalized. And the balance of the risks to our two mandates has changed. Our objective has been to restore price stability while maintaining a strong labor market, avoiding the sharp increases in unemployment that characterized earlier disinflationary episodes when inflation expectations were less well anchored. While the task is not complete, we have made a good deal of progress toward that outcome.\nToday, I will begin by addressing the current economic situation and the path ahead for monetary policy. I will then turn to a discussion of economic events since the pandemic arrived, exploring why inflation rose to levels not seen in a generation, and why it has fallen so much while unemployment has remained low.\nNear-Term Outlook for Policy\nLet's begin with the current situation and the near-term outlook for policy.\nFor much of the past three years, inflation ran well above our 2 percent goal, and labor market conditions were extremely tight. The Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) primary focus has been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so. Prior to this episode, most Americans alive today had not experienced the pain of high inflation for a sustained period. Inflation brought substantial hardship, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. High inflation triggered stress and a sense of unfairness that linger today.\n1\nOur restrictive monetary policy helped restore balance between aggregate supply and demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remained well anchored. Inflation is now much closer to our objective, with prices having risen 2.5 percent over the past 12 months (\nfigure 1\n).\n2\nAfter a pause earlier this year, progress toward our 2 percent objective has resumed. My confidence has grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2 percent.\nTurning to employment, in the years just prior to the pandemic, we saw the significant benefits to society that can come from a long period of strong labor market conditions: low unemployment, high participation, historically low racial employment gaps, and, with inflation low and stable, healthy real wage gains that were increasingly concentrated among those with lower incomes.\n3\nToday, the labor market has cooled considerably from its formerly overheated state. The unemployment rate began to rise over a year ago and is now at 4.3 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0094still low by historical standards, but almost a full percentage point above its level in early 2023 (\nfigure 2\n). Most of that increase has come over the past six months. So far, rising unemployment has not been the result of elevated layoffs, as is typically the case in an economic downturn. Rather, the increase mainly reflects a substantial increase in the supply of workers and a slowdown from the previously frantic pace of hiring. Even so, the cooling in labor market conditions is unmistakable. Job gains remain solid but have slowed this year.\n4\nJob vacancies have fallen, and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment has returned to its pre-pandemic range. The hiring and quits rates are now below the levels that prevailed in 2018 and 2019. Nominal wage gains have moderated. All told, labor market conditions are now less tight than just before the pandemic in 2019\u00e2\u0080\u0094a year when inflation ran below 2 percent. It seems unlikely that the labor market will be a source of elevated inflationary pressures anytime soon. We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions.\nOverall, the economy continues to grow at a solid pace. But the inflation and labor market data show an evolving situation. The upside risks to inflation have diminished. And the downside risks to employment have increased. As we highlighted in our last FOMC statement, we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate.\nThe time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\nWe will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward price stability. With an appropriate dialing back of policy restraint, there is good reason to think that the economy will get back to 2 percent inflation while maintaining a strong labor market. The current level of our policy rate gives us ample room to respond to any risks we may face, including the risk of unwelcome further weakening in labor market conditions.\nThe Rise and Fall of Inflation\nLet's now turn to the questions of why inflation rose, and why it has fallen so significantly even as unemployment has remained low. There is a growing body of research on these questions, and this is a good time for this discussion.\n5\nIt is, of course, too soon to make definitive assessments. This period will be analyzed and debated long after we are gone.\nThe arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic led quickly to shutdowns in economies around the world. It was a time of radical uncertainty and severe downside risks. As so often happens in times of crisis, Americans adapted and innovated. Governments responded with extraordinary force, especially in the U.S. Congress unanimously passed the CARES Act. At the Fed, we used our powers to an unprecedented extent to stabilize the financial system and help stave off an economic depression.\nAfter a historically deep but brief recession, in mid-2020 the economy began to grow again. As the risks of a severe, extended downturn receded, and as the economy reopened, we faced the risk of replaying the painfully slow recovery that followed the Global Financial Crisis.\nCongress delivered substantial additional fiscal support in late 2020 and again in early 2021. Spending recovered strongly in the first half of 2021. The ongoing pandemic shaped the pattern of the recovery. Lingering concerns over COVID weighed on spending on in-person services. But pent-up demand, stimulative policies, pandemic changes in work and leisure practices, and the additional savings associated with constrained services spending all contributed to a historic surge in consumer spending on goods.\nThe pandemic also wreaked havoc on supply conditions. Eight million people left the workforce at its onset, and the size of the labor force was still 4 million below its pre-pandemic level in early 2021. The labor force would not return to its pre-pandemic trend until mid-2023 (\nfigure 3\n).\n6\nSupply chains were snarled by a combination of lost workers, disrupted international trade linkages, and tectonic shifts in the composition and level of demand (\nfigure 4\n). Clearly, this was nothing like the slow recovery after the Global Financial Crisis.\nEnter inflation. After running below target through 2020, inflation spiked in March and April 2021. The initial burst of inflation was concentrated rather than broad based, with extremely large price increases for goods in short supply, such as motor vehicles. My colleagues and I judged at the outset that these pandemic-related factors would not be persistent and, thus, that the sudden rise in inflation was likely to pass through fairly quickly without the need for a monetary policy response\u00e2\u0080\u0094in short, that the inflation would be transitory. Standard thinking has long been that, as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, it can be appropriate for central banks to look through a temporary rise in inflation.\n7\nThe good ship Transitory was a crowded one, with most mainstream analysts and advanced-economy central bankers on board.\n8\nThe common expectation was that supply conditions would improve reasonably quickly, that the rapid recovery in demand would run its course, and that demand would rotate back from goods to services, bringing inflation down.\nFor a time, the data were consistent with the transitory hypothesis. Monthly readings for core inflation declined every month from April to September 2021, although progress came slower than expected (\nfigure 5\n). The case began to weaken around midyear, as was reflected in our communications. Beginning in October, the data turned hard against the transitory hypothesis.\n9\nInflation rose and broadened out from goods into services. It became clear that the high inflation was not transitory, and that it would require a strong policy response if inflation expectations were to remain well anchored. We recognized that and pivoted beginning in November. Financial conditions began to tighten. After phasing out our asset purchases, we lifted off in March 2022.\nBy early 2022, headline inflation exceeded 6 percent, with core inflation above 5 percent. New supply shocks appeared. Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to a sharp increase in energy and commodity prices. The improvements in supply conditions and rotation in demand from goods to services were taking much longer than expected, in part due to further COVID waves in the U.S.\n10\nAnd COVID continued to disrupt production globally, including through new and extended lockdowns in China.\n11\nHigh rates of inflation were a global phenomenon, reflecting common experiences: rapid increases in the demand for goods, strained supply chains, tight labor markets, and sharp hikes in commodity prices.\n12\nThe global nature of inflation was unlike any period since the 1970s. Back then, high inflation became entrenched\u00e2\u0080\u0094an outcome we were utterly committed to avoiding.\nBy mid-2022, the labor market was extremely tight, with employment increasing by over 6-1/2 million from the middle of 2021. This increase in labor demand was met, in part, by workers rejoining the labor force as health concerns began to fade. But labor supply remained constrained, and, in the summer of 2022, labor force participation remained well below pre-pandemic levels. There were nearly twice as many job openings as unemployed persons from March 2022 through the end of the year, signaling a severe labor shortage (\nfigure 6\n).\n13\nInflation peaked at 7.1 percent in June 2022.\nAt this podium two years ago, I discussed the possibility that addressing inflation could bring some pain in the form of higher unemployment and slower growth. Some argued that getting inflation under control would require a recession and a lengthy period of high unemployment.\n14\nI expressed our unconditional commitment to fully restoring price stability and to keeping at it until the job is done.\nThe FOMC did not flinch from carrying out our responsibilities, and our actions forcefully demonstrated our commitment to restoring price stability. We raised our policy rate by 425 basis points in 2022 and another 100 basis points in 2023. We have held our policy rate at its current restrictive level since July 2023 (\nfigure 7\n).\nThe summer of 2022 proved to be the peak of inflation. The 4-1/2 percentage point decline in inflation from its peak two years ago has occurred in a context of low unemployment\u00e2\u0080\u0094a welcome and historically unusual result.\nHow did inflation fall without a sharp rise in unemployment above its estimated natural rate?\nPandemic-related distortions to supply and demand, as well as severe shocks to energy and commodity markets, were important drivers of high inflation, and their reversal has been a key part of the story of its decline. The unwinding of these factors took much longer than expected but ultimately played a large role in the subsequent disinflation. Our restrictive monetary policy contributed to a moderation in aggregate demand, which combined with improvements in aggregate supply to reduce inflationary pressures while allowing growth to continue at a healthy pace. As labor demand also moderated, the historically high level of vacancies relative to unemployment has normalized primarily through a decline in vacancies, without sizable and disruptive layoffs, bringing the labor market to a state where it is no longer a source of inflationary pressures.\nA word on the critical importance of inflation expectations. Standard economic models have long reflected the view that inflation will return to its objective when product and labor markets are balanced\u00e2\u0080\u0094without the need for economic slack\u00e2\u0080\u0094so long as inflation expectations are anchored at our objective. That's what the models said, but the stability of longer-run inflation expectations since the 2000s had not been tested by a persistent burst of high inflation. It was far from assured that the inflation anchor would hold. Concerns over de-anchoring contributed to the view that disinflation would require slack in the economy and specifically in the labor market. An important takeaway from recent experience is that anchored inflation expectations, reinforced by vigorous central bank actions, can facilitate disinflation without the need for slack.\nThis narrative attributes much of the increase in inflation to an extraordinary collision between overheated and temporarily distorted demand and constrained supply. While researchers differ in their approaches and, to some extent, in their conclusions, a consensus seems to be emerging, which I see as attributing most of the rise in inflation to this collision.\n15\nAll told, the healing from pandemic distortions, our efforts to moderate aggregate demand, and the anchoring of expectations have worked together to put inflation on what increasingly appears to be a sustainable path to our 2 percent objective.\nDisinflation while preserving labor market strength is only possible with anchored inflation expectations, which reflect the public's confidence that the central bank will bring about 2 percent inflation over time. That confidence has been built over decades and reinforced by our actions.\nThat is my assessment of events. Your mileage may vary.\nConclusion\nLet me wrap up by emphasizing that the pandemic economy has proved to be unlike any other, and that there remains much to be learned from this extraordinary period. Our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy emphasizes our commitment to reviewing our principles and making appropriate adjustments through a thorough public review every five years. As we begin this process later this year, we will be open to criticism and new ideas, while preserving the strengths of our framework. The limits of our kn",

Bowman\nAt the Alaska Bankers Association, Anchorage, Alaska\nShare\nGood morning. It is really a pleasure to join you here in Alaska.\n1\nGetting outside of Washington, D.C. and hearing about the unique issues that affect Alaskans provides valuable insights that inform my work at the Federal Reserve. A part of the mission of the Federal Reserve is to support an economy that works for everyone. Consumers and communities are more successful when they have access to financial products and services that meet their needs. While many of these products and services are available online, as Alaskans know better than most Americans, geography and location are also important. This access often looks very different in places with many remote and rural communities. Today, I will discuss the Federal Reserve's work to promote a more inclusive financial system, including our work on financial inclusion for Indigenous communities. Before diving into those topics, I will share my current views on the economy and monetary policy.\nEconomic and Monetary Policy Outlook\nOver the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our July meeting, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.\nAfter seeing considerable progress last year, in recent months we have seen some further progress on lowering inflation. The 12-month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which I prefer to the more volatile higher-frequency readings, have moved down since April, although they have remained somewhat elevated at 2.5 percent and 2.6 percent in June, respectively. In addition, the latest consumer and producer price index reports indicate that 12-month core PCE inflation likely remained a bit above 2.5 percent in July. The progress in lowering inflation since April is a welcome development, but inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee's 2 percent goal.\nPrices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh on consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest, since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years.\nEconomic activity moderated in the first half of this year after increasing at a strong pace last year. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP) growth was solid and slowed much less than gross domestic product (GDP), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile categories such as net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than GDP indicated. Unusually strong consumer goods spending last year softened in the first quarter of this year, largely accounting for the step-down in PDFP growth. Goods spending rebounded in the second quarter and retail sales continued to rise at a solid pace in July.\nConsumers appear to be pulling back on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant spending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have savings to support this type of spending, and we've seen a normalization of loan delinquency rates as they have risen from historically low levels during the pandemic.\nThe labor market continues to loosen, as the number of available workers has increased and the number of available jobs has declined\u00e2\u0080\u0094signs that illustrate the labor market is coming into better balance. After slowing in the second quarter, payroll employment gains eased to a more modest pace in July, even as job openings are being filled by the increased immigrant labor supply. The latest labor market report shows that the unemployment rate stood at 4.3 percent in July. Although notably higher than a year ago, this is still a historically low unemployment rate. In addition, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined to its pre-pandemic level. We are also seeing a slowing in wage growth, which now stands at just under 4 percent as measured by the employment cost index. However, given trend productivity, wage gains remain above the pace consistent with our inflation goal.\nMy baseline outlook is that inflation will decline further with the current stance of monetary policy. Should the incoming data continue to show that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive on economic activity and employment. But we need to be patient and avoid undermining continued progress on lowering inflation by overreacting to any single data point. Instead, we must view the data in their totality as the risks to the Committee's employment and price-stability mandates continue to move into better balance. That said, I still see some upside risks to inflation as supply conditions have now largely normalized and any further improvements to supply seem less likely to offset price pressures arising from increasing geopolitical tensions, additional fiscal stimulus, and increased demand for housing due to immigration.\nThere are also risks that the labor market has not been as strong as the payroll data have been indicating, and it appears that the recent rise in unemployment may be exaggerating the degree of cooling in labor markets. The Q4 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) report suggests that job gains have been consistently overstated in the establishment survey since March of last year, while the household survey unemployment data have become less accurate as response rates have appreciably declined since the pandemic.\n2\nThe rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job searchers entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, and layoffs remain low. It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the soft July employment report. The rise in the unemployment rate in July was largely accounted for by workers who are experiencing a temporary layoff and are more likely to be rehired in coming months. Hurricane Beryl also likely contributed to weaker job gains, as the number of workers not working due to bad weather increased significantly last month.\nIn light of upside risks to inflation and uncertainty regarding labor market conditions and the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. Increased measurement challenges and the frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the current state of the economy and predicting how it will evolve even more challenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to considering adjustments to the current stance of policy.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when assessing how the FOMC's monetary policy decisions may evolve. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. By the time of our September meeting, we will have seen additional economic data and information, including one employment and one inflation report. We will also monitor how developments in broader financial conditions might influence the economic outlook.\nI will continue to closely watch the data and visit with a broad range of contacts as I assess economic conditions and the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As I noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as somewhat elevated. And with some upside risks to inflation, I still see the need to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate while watching for risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view continues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.\nFocus on Financial Inclusion\nI will turn now to discuss our work to promote financial inclusion. An inclusive financial system enables access to financial services that enhance the financial well-being of consumers and businesses. Consumers come from a wide range of economic circumstances, with varied perceptions of and experiences with the banking system and different financial needs. All consumers should have access to the financial services and products they need.\nThe U.S. economy benefits when more households achieve financial stability. Yet, while we have made significant progress in expanding access to financial services and deposit accounts in the United States, the remaining challenges often include geographic location, products that meet specific customer needs, the absence of financial literacy education, lack of access to technology and reliable internet, and in some cases, language. These challenges are even more acute in providing access to financial services to Indigenous populations like those here in Alaska. It is impressive to see that many financial services providers, including banks and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), are working to address these challenges and making significant inroads.\nImportance of banks in furthering financial inclusion\nThe U.S. financial system is uniquely positioned to bring consumers into the financial mainstream by providing innovative solutions to meet the credit needs of their communities. Banks and other depository institutions assist consumers and small businesses by providing financial products and services that are safe, fair, and responsive. In doing so, they serve a critical role in connecting consumers to the financial system and to the economy.\nSmaller banks, including community banks, are indispensable in providing access to financial products and services, especially in more remote or rural areas. Here, in Alaska, your banks are the front-line providers for your communities. As you know well, community banks support small businesses through credit and technical assistance and targeted support specific to customers in their communities. As a former community banker, I know firsthand that smaller banks deeply understand their communities because they live in the local economy and know their customers well.\nThis was especially apparent during the COVID pandemic. Community banks rose to the challenge and continued to support the needs of their customers and communities. One of the programs first made available in response to the pandemic was the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was geared to small businesses and was necessarily dependent on community banks. The PPP was timely and effective in helping millions of businesses weather the initial phase of the pandemic, and community banks were absolutely essential to the success of the program.\n3\nThis successful outcome is probably not surprising to this audience, because when it comes to lending to small businesses, community banks have always been an outsized source of credit, relative to their size in the banking system. Before the pandemic, community banks accounted for over 40 percent of all small business lending, while they only accounted for roughly 15 percent of total assets in the banking system.\n4\nThis trend has continued. An analysis of June 2023 call report data showed that community banks had larger shares of small-business loans relative to their total assets than larger institutions.\n5\nCommunity banks know their customers, and they know their communities. During that challenging time, community bank CEOs told me that early in the pandemic they directly contacted every single one of their business and consumer loan customers. They took the time to check in with each one to see how they were doing, and what they needed. They encouraged customers to keep in touch with the bank, and they noted the available opportunities for payment deferrals and other options that customers might not have been aware of. Because of this relationship banking model, small banks were and continue to be able to provide more tailored financial products and services that are designed to meet the specific needs of their customers.\n6\nWe all recognize the important role of small banks in the functioning of the U.S. economy by supporting the financial needs of their customers and communities. The Federal Reserve relies on insights from community banks and created a mechanism to formalize the views and feedback from community banks on a regular basis through our Reserve Bank and Board Community Depository Institutions Advisory Councils (CDIAC). The Board CDIAC includes a representative from each of the local advisory councils at the 12 Reserve Banks. CDIAC members are bankers from community banks, thrifts, and credit unions who provide insight and information about the economy, lending conditions, and other issues that they see firsthand in their communities.\nThis perspective helps us gain insights into economic activity and the impact of our policies on rural and underserved communities.\nCentral Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion\nI will turn now to highlight our efforts in providing broader access to financial services. In 2021, the Federal Reserve became a member of the Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion (CBNII).\n7\nThis group brings together the central banks of the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. The network enabled us to initiate an ongoing international dialogue to raise awareness of economic and financial issues in Indigenous populations. This allows us to share knowledge and best practices, promote engagement and education, and work together with Indigenous communities.\nAs the Federal Reserve's representative to the network, I have prioritized expanding our outreach and engagement efforts to include all U.S. Native populations, Native Alaskan, Native Hawaiian, and Native American. Coming here to Alaska is a key part of this role to ensure that the Federal Reserve continues to expand our firsthand knowledge and understanding of the issues and barriers that may prevent full engagement in the economy. I take these responsibilities seriously and have made meeting with and learning from Indigenous groups and leaders a priority in my work.\nIn October 2021, I met with Native American leaders in South Dakota and on the Pine Ridge Reservation. These tribal leaders highlighted the importance of building understanding by meeting with people in their communities to enhance our knowledge of their soc",

I am delighted to welcome you all in person to the 2024 Summer Workshop on Money, Banking, Payments, and Finance, jointly organized by the Federal Reserve Board, the Bank of Canada, and the Study Center Gerzensee.\n1\nI want to thank the organizers for putting together such an interesting program and also thank the participants for their contributions.\nThe evolving nature of money and banking creates new channels through which financial markets and institutions can affect the economy, with implications for all five of the Federal Reserve's functions, which are monetary policy, financial stability, supervision and regulation, payment systems, and consumers and communities. Relatedly, the emergence of new technologies can generate complex economic interactions, and theoretical research and analytical work are crucial to understanding the implications.\nMany of the concepts underlying such economic interactions have for years been the study of this workshop. When I was research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, I put together several iterations of this gathering. As the organization of the workshop has passed to a new generation, I continue to find it to be a leading venue for studying the economic mechanisms through which money, financial markets, contracts, and institutions affect economic activity and economic welfare. Past participants have advanced modern money and banking theory, bringing new insights to real-world economic problems and policy analysis. Numerous research papers presented in these workshops have been published in prestigious economics journals and influenced scholarship in this area.\nIf I had to describe the work that has been presented at this conference over the last 20-plus years, I would say it focuses on the economics of exchange and payment. Walrasian supply and demand models describe how an equilibrium quantity and price are determined but it is silent on two key questions: how do the goods get from seller to buyer and how is payment made from buyer to seller? In short, standard supply and demand analyses have nothing to say about the actual exchange process and how payment is made\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a sense, exchange and payment are viewed as trivial issues. By delving into the micro-foundations of exchange and payment, researchers in this area were able to identify key frictions that make exchange and payment far from trivial.\nThis is not just a theoretical issue that is only relevant to economists in ivory towers. Payments and the exchange process are multibillion-dollar businesses and private sector firms are constantly innovating in this area to overcome the types of frictions that are well-known to this group. The knowledge that I have gained from interacting with researchers in this area for the last 20 years has aided me in one of my roles as a Federal Reserve governor, supporting the Fed's oversight of the U.S. payment system. It also guides my thinking about how to make global payments cheaper and faster, which is a key objective adopted by the G20 countries in 2020 and is one fully supported by the Federal Reserve.\nKeeping with the tradition of studying exchange and payment, several papers to be presented this year focus on how frictions in financial markets, such as asymmetric information or asset illiquidity, matter for the transmission and implementation of monetary policy as well as unemployment and inflation. Similarly, it is great to continue seeing work studying frictional intermediation in asset markets and the implications for asset prices and the efficient sharing of risk. These contributions push the frontier of our knowledge, facilitate our understanding of real-world complexities, and inform policy thinking.\nThe workshop's focus on broader financial stability issues is also very important. Financial stability vulnerabilities, such as run risk, excessive leverage, and bubbly valuations, could amplify the effect of adverse shocks, potentially resulting in big economic losses and a slowdown in economic activity. Understanding the mechanisms that allow these vulnerabilities to grow and transmit stress to the rest of the financial system requires rigorous theoretical research and solid micro-foundations. Over the course of this week, we will hear interesting work on this topic that includes research questions such as how a central bank can balance interventions for financial stability and interventions to achieve a certain stance of monetary policy, how banks take risks, and understanding the risk of runs on banks, non-banks, and stablecoins.\nOther concepts are newer and more novel. As the monetary and financial ecosystem has evolved, so has this workshop, bringing together many perspectives and modeling approaches to money and banking theory and its applications. One recurring theme has been to pay special attention to micro-foundations and institutional details, which is important to rigorously analyze and understand today's financial innovations and evaluate their implications for welfare and policy.\nThis year's workshop continues in that innovative spirit, keeping an eye on the future of money and banking. The papers to be presented span areas including decentralized ledgers, exchanges for crypto assets, and the impact of certain protocols on financial stability. Researching these new technologies helps us deepen our understanding of the implications for the broader financial system.\nAn important point to remember this week is that no single field of study can give the answers to all of the big questions we face relating to the evolution of money and banking. Commingling of insights and techniques from monetary theory, finance theory, and other fields is vital in studying the complex interactions of modern financial systems. Of course, it is also important to test our theories with available data, and many papers we will see this week deliver on that count as well.\nWithout further ado, let's get started. I hope you have a great week of engaging discussions, and I'm sure we will learn a lot from this year's workshop.\n1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\nReturn to text\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            August 19, 2024",

Bowman\nAt the 2024 CEO and Senior Management Summit and Annual Meeting, sponsored by the Kansas Bankers Association, Colorado Springs, Colorado\nShare\nThank you for the invitation to join you again this year.\n1\nJust as banking and economic conditions continue to evolve, so too do bank regulatory and supervisory standards. I look forward to learning your perspectives on the evolving banking and economic conditions, and the banking agencies' approaches to regulation and supervision.\nEconomic and Monetary Policy Outlook\nBefore discussing my thoughts on bank regulatory matters, and in light of our recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I will begin by sharing my current views on the economy and monetary policy.\nOver the past two years, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our July meeting, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5\u00e2\u0080\u00911/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.\nAfter seeing considerable progress last year, we have seen some further progress on lowering inflation in recent months. The 12-month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which I prefer relative to more volatile higher-frequency readings, have moved down since April, although they have remained somewhat elevated and stood at 2.5 percent and 2.6 percent in June, respectively. The progress in lowering inflation during May and June is a welcome development, but inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee's 2 percent goal.\nDespite the recent good data reports, core PCE inflation averaged an annualized 3.4 percent over the first half of the year. And given that supply constraints have now largely normalized, I am not confident that inflation will decline in the same way as in the second half of last year. More importantly, prices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh on consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest, since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years.\nEconomic activity moderated in the first half of this year after increasing at a strong pace last year. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth moved up in the second quarter, following a soft reading in the first quarter, while private domestic final purchases (PDFP) increased at a solid pace in both quarters. During the first half of 2024, PDFP slowed much less than GDP, as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile categories such as net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than GDP indicated. Unusually strong consumer goods spending last year softened in the first quarter of this year, largely accounting for the step-down in PDFP growth.\nAlthough consumer spending strengthened in the second quarter, consumers appear to be pulling back on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant spending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have savings to support this type of spending, and we've seen a normalization of loan delinquency rates as they have risen from historically low levels during the pandemic.\nThe labor market continues to loosen, as the number of available workers has increased and the number of available jobs has declined\u00e2\u0080\u0094showing signs that the labor market is coming into better balance. After slowing in the second quarter, payroll employment gains eased to a more modest pace in July, even as job openings are being filled by the increased immigrant labor supply. The latest labor market report shows that the unemployment rate stood at 4.3 percent in July. Although notably higher than a year ago, this is still a historically low unemployment rate. In addition, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined to its pre-pandemic level. We are also seeing a slowing in wage growth, which now stands at just under 4 percent as measured by the employment cost index. However, given trend productivity, wage gains are still above the pace consistent with our inflation goal.\nMy baseline outlook is that inflation will decline further with the current stance of monetary policy. Should the incoming data continue to show that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive on economic activity and employment. But we need to be patient and avoid undermining continued progress on lowering inflation by overreacting to any single data point. Instead, we must view the data in their totality as the risks to the Committee's employment and price-stability mandates continue to move into better balance. That said, I still see some upside risks to inflation.\nFirst, as I noted earlier, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due both to increased labor force participation and strong immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unlikely that further improvements along this margin will continue to lower inflation going forward, as supply chains have largely normalized, the labor force participation rate has leveled off in recent months below pre-pandemic levels, and significantly higher U.S. immigration over the past few years may decrease going forward.\nGeopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, as the recent surge in container shipping costs originating in Asia suggest that global supply chains remain susceptible to disruptions, which could put upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices. There is also the risk that additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, impeding further progress on reducing inflation.\nFinally, there continues to be a risk that the increased immigration could lead to persistently high housing services inflation. Given the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize.\nThere are also risks that the labor market has not been as strong as the payroll data have been indicating, but it also appears that the recent rise in unemployment may be exaggerating the degree of cooling in labor markets. The Q4 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) report implies that job gains have been consistently overstated in the establishment survey since March of last year, while the household survey unemployment data have become less accurate as response rates have appreciably declined since the pandemic.\n2\nMoreover, the rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job searchers entering the labor force are taking longer to find a job, while layoffs remain low. It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the soft July employment report. The rise in the unemployment rate in July was centered in workers experiencing a temporary layoff, who are more likely to be rehired in coming months, and Hurricane Beryl likely contributed to weaker job gains, as the number of workers not working due to bad weather increased significantly last month.\nIn light of upside risks to inflation and uncertainty regarding labor market conditions and the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. Increased measurement challenges and the frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the current state of the economy and predicting how it will evolve even more challenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to considering adjustments to the current stance of policy.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when assessing how the FOMC's monetary policy decisions may evolve. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook, with a focus on the dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. By the time of our September meeting, we will have seen a range of additional economic data and information, including one employment and two inflation reports. We will also have a wider view of how developments in broader financial conditions might influence the economic outlook. In particular, equity prices have been volatile recently but are still higher than at the end of last year.\nI will continue to closely monitor the data and visit with a broad range of contacts as I assess economic conditions and the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As I noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as somewhat elevated. And with some upside risks to inflation, I still see the need to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate while watching for risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view continues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.\nBanking Regulation and Supervision\nI will turn now to bank regulation and supervision. Today I would like to address a few topics that I expect will be of interest to those in this room, starting with the issue of culture both within banks and at bank and other financial regulatory agencies. I will then briefly discuss mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity in the banking industry, and the current and expected outlook for bank transactions. I will close with a discussion on bank liquidity regulation.\nThe Role of Culture at Banks and at Regulators\nIn recent years, regulatory approaches have included regulators seeking to influence the culture within banks, specifically large banks, focusing on matters like building a culture that promotes compliance or effective risk management, including operational risk. A bank's culture drives its sense of ownership and a collective purpose that is common among many successful organizations, where a bank's board, management, and employees all work together in support of the bank's business purpose and mission. Bank culture can have a strong influence on both business outcomes and on compliance and risk-management outcomes.\nBank culture starts with bank leadership, the so-called tone from the top. Strong bank culture demands accountability for bank leadership teams and for the entire workforce. A bank's management is responsible for setting the strategic direction of the company, including which business lines to pursue, expand, or eliminate. But bank leaders also have a responsibility to empower employees to raise issues and concerns, allowing them to identify and escalate emerging business, risk-management, or compliance matters that may require management's attention or intervention. While regulators have sought to influence bank culture over time, ultimately culture is most heavily influenced and shaped by the example set by bank leaders and by the actions of each bank employee.\nRegulatory agency culture can be similarly impactful in shaping bank regulation and supervision to promote safety and soundness and consumer compliance in an effective and efficient manner. In contrast to regulators, bank management may choose to modify or reshape their mission and objectives over time\u00e2\u0080\u0094evolving their business goals, risk-management policies and processes, and compliance standards as conditions change. For regulators, the overarching regulatory and supervisory mission and related institutional goals are prescribed by statute. While bank regulators lack the flexibility to change the mission, they have significant flexibility in the execution of that mission. This often involves broad policy goals\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, promoting the safety and soundness of the banking system, and the stability of the financial system.\nSimilar to bank culture, regulatory agency culture begins with its leadership and is then carried out by the individual members of the organization's workforce. Culture plays a significant role in how well bank regulators pursue their statutory objectives and the manner in which they perform the related mission. Have regulators created a culture that allows the staff to identify and escalate issues of concern? Have regulators oriented the mission of the institution around core statutory goals and avoided the temptation to stray from this mission into other matters of public policy? Have regulators created a culture of accountability for leaders and employees, where shortcomings can be fairly identified and actions can be taken to remediate problems?\nWhile the value of culture is widely acknowledged, both among banks and among bank regulators, we have seen some recent high-profile examples of culture falling short, and with serious consequences.\n3\nResponsible banking involves not only finding and pursuing opportunities to serve customers and grow the business, but also balancing these business priorities with a firm commitment to risk management and compliance, including consumer compliance. While banks are free to pursue growth, in some instances this growth has come without accompanying development of and investment in risk management and legal compliance, to the detriment of the bank and its customers.\nIn the case of Silicon Valley Bank's (SVB) failure in 2023, rapid growth was certainly a factor that contributed to the firm's fragility. The bank's management failed to properly manage its development of contingent liquidity planning, funding, and risk-management capabilities in light of its rapid growth. While this failure revealed problems with bank leadership in promoting a compliance and risk-management culture commensurate with growth, supervisors directly overseeing the bank's expansion were also late to act in the face of emerging firm risks.\nI think we should question whether we have learned all of the right lessons from SVB's failure. We know that rapid growth is a known risk factor that should result in\nadditional\nsupervisory scrutiny. But some of the post-failure SVB reviews conducted internally by Federal Reserve staff cited rapid growth as a contributing factor for the inadequacy of the supervisory approach.\n4\nAmong other things, these internal reports suggested that the shift of SVB from one supervisory portfolio to another somehow frustrated appropriate supervision. We need to ask whether supervisors are em",

Bowman\nAt \"Advance Together: Celebrating the Achievements of Texas Community Partnerships,\" a public event at the  Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Dallas, Texas (via pre-recorded video)\nShare\nAccessible Keys for Video\n[Space Bar]\ntoggles play/pause;\n[Right/Left Arrows]\nseeks the video forwards and back (5 sec );\n[Up/Down Arrows]\nincrease/decrease volume;\n[M]\ntoggles mute on/off;\n[F]\ntoggles fullscreen on/off (Except IE 11);\nThe\n[Tab]\nkey may be used in combination with the\n[Enter/Return]\nkey to navigate and activate control buttons, such as caption on/off.\nI'd like to thank everyone for joining us today to celebrate the achievements of Texas community partnerships. I am so excited to be a part of this important milestone, marking the end of the pilot round of Advance Together and to announce a second round for this initiative.\nBack in 2021, during the depths of COVID, I took part in the Dallas Fed's Advance Together launch event, welcoming the awardees into the initiative and looking ahead to their success. This is truly a special opportunity to recognize the progress and achievements of the four participating partnerships, each representing their diverse communities and regions in the great state of Texas.\nAdvance Together is an accelerator program for regional public\u00e2\u0080\u0093private\u00e2\u0080\u0093nonprofit partnerships seeking to improve education and employment outcomes for lower-income communities in Texas. The Dallas Fed and the Federal Reserve System are focused on reducing and removing barriers to education attainment and workforce development to foster a strong, resilient economy.\nAs the nation's central bank, the Federal Reserve Board is focused on our dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. When we think about maximum employment, we also need to consider how to foster an inclusive economy that provides economic opportunities for everyone regardless of their circumstances.\nEvery Reserve Bank relies on its community development function to understand the economic circumstances of communities through community initiatives and research. In response to local needs in their respective Districts, each Reserve Bank develops initiatives and focus areas to support these efforts.\nCollaboration Matters for Better Community Outcomes\nAdvance Together was designed to address core challenges in education and workforce development. Often, a lack of coordination among key organizations, fragmentation across existing resources, or incomplete approaches that don't fully identify or address the root causes of community issues lead to less successful outcomes.\nResearch from the Boston Fed has found that durable economic success throughout economic cycles is less dependent on factors like industry mix, demographics, or even geographic location. Instead, it is the ability of local leaders to work together across different sectors that leads to economic resilience. Leaders that collaborate with an identified plan and path over a sustained period of time toward a comprehensive vision achieve better outcomes and more inclusive economic growth.\nA few years ago, the Dallas Fed identified an opportunity in Texas to support community partnerships, specifically in education and workforce development.\nWorking across different sectors and industries brings its own set of unique challenges. Each brings different goals, operations, and even terminology to the discussion.\nWe know that collaboration is necessary, and it is achievable. Advance Together provides the structure, ongoing support, and investment from external partners to support communities in strengthening their collaborative work. It takes time and skill to build deep and trusting partnerships.\nIt also takes time and resources for communities to agree upon a common understanding of complex, local needs like improving college and career readiness or developing pathways to living wage employment.\nThis work requires that all partners move in the same direction, toward those common strategies and goals. When communities collaborate effectively, the results can lead to broader access to economic opportunity.\nAT Team Introductions\nWe are here today to celebrate the success of our pilot participants; I'd like to reintroduce each of them:\nThe Big Country Manufacturing Alliance is building awareness and creating accessible pathways to well-paying manufacturing careers through training, recruitment, and retention.\nThe Deep East Texas College & Career Alliance supports rural and first-generation college students in attaining postsecondary credentials that employers seek in their workforce.\nThe Education Partnership of the Permian Basin is developing a cradle-to-career continuum of support by working to improve early childhood outcomes and college and career readiness in the region.\nThe Travis County 2-Gen Coalition is expanding practices and policies to support dual generations of parents and children in education attainment and achieving long-term financial stability.\nConclusion\nAs we begin today's celebration, I'd like to recognize the vision of the Dallas Fed team for creating this incredible opportunity for our partners. I'd also like to thank our Advance Together partnerships for their hard work and progress. I also want to recognize them for the work that they will continue to accomplish in their communities as they move forward. This work is challenging and will continue to build pathways to a more inclusive economy.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            July 24, 2024",

Bowman\nAt \"Exploring Conventional Bank Funding Regimes in an Unconventional World\" A Research Conference Co-Sponsored by the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Atlanta, Dallas, Texas\nShare\nWatch Live\nEarlier this year, we passed the one-year anniversary of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank. The failure of these banks, and the subsequent failure of First Republic Bank, prompted a discussion of the regulatory framework. These failures have also frequently been cited as the basis for a number of matters on the current regulatory reform agenda. Over time, this agenda has expanded to include bank capital regulation, the role of supervision, the potential vulnerabilities to the banking system created by bank-fintech partnerships, and bank liquidity and funding, among other topics.\n1\nThis conference covers a number of important issues that touch on many aspects of this regulatory reform agenda. Earlier today, panelists discussed the 2023 regional banking stress, the history of financial crises, and deposit insurance reform. Tomorrow we will hear about the discount window and a discussion on the future of contingent liquidity. A further panel will consider what may be next in terms of regulatory reforms.\nIn considering this last topic, conferences like this serve an important role\u00e2\u0080\u0094encouraging us to pause and reflect upon these efforts, and providing an opportunity to share thoughts in full public view about what is working and not working within the bank regulatory framework. These discussions also allow us to consider a range of options to both enhance banking system resiliency and to better prepare for future stress in the system. I am especially pleased that we have an opportunity to publicly confront difficult questions, like probing the link between last year's banking stress and elements of the reform agenda purportedly aimed at addressing identified deficiencies.\nAs we think about reform of the bank regulatory framework, including changes designed to maintain a robust and responsive approach, what are the principles that should guide our thinking? What lessons should we take from past financial crises in terms of the causality and related bank management and supervisory lessons learned? Were those reforms responsive, successful, and durable over time? When we consider the Federal Reserve's operational infrastructure, including Fedwire\u00ae and discount window lending, were its tools effective and complementary to other funding sources (including Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) funding) during times of stress, and if not, how could they be improved?\nMy hope is that in discussing these issues we can develop a better and deeper understanding about sources of bank funding, financial stability, and the future of the banking system. This complex set of issues can be open to interpretation, and as a result, can lead policymakers to different policy prescriptions for how to make the banking system more resilient, and the regulatory response to financial stress more effective.\nConversations like those that we are having today and tomorrow can help us find consensus both in identifying the risks to the financial system and coming to agreement on policy reforms to address them, if needed. As the discussions continue following this conference, it is essential that we include the experience and perspective of state bank commissioners. I look forward to the opportunity to engage with them more fully on these issues. As a former bank commissioner, I greatly value this perspective.\nI am hopeful that all of these conversations can help us to understand differing perspectives and enable us to examine the full extent of the underlying issues before we implement reforms that do not address identified problems or do not adequately consider the underlying risks and unintended consequences.\nWhen I think about regulatory reform and the future of the banking system, I begin with the foundational elements that promote accountability in banking regulation: a deep understanding of the banking system; a thorough analysis of the underlying facts; a careful identification of how elements of the banking system interact and perform over time, especially during stress; and a commitment to take ownership of identified problems with targeted reforms that are commensurate with the underlying risks.\nThese same elements should be the foundational elements of any reform agenda. They should apply not just to changes that I will call \"responsive\" changes\u00e2\u0080\u0094those designed to mitigate the risks exposed during the spring 2023 banking stress\u00e2\u0080\u0094but also to any other contemplated reforms of the bank regulatory framework. If we approach this task with humility and with full accountability of unintended consequences, I expect that we will find opportunities in a number of areas. These involve not only imposing new requirements and expectations on individual banks, but also opportunities to remediate deficiencies and overlapping requirements within the regulatory framework. Both approaches may be equally effective in enhancing the resilience of the banking system and promoting U.S. financial stability.\nIn my remarks this evening, I will reflect on these elements, as I share my views on the Fed's lender of last resort function, payments infrastructure, supervision, and regulation.\nLender of Last Resort and Payments Infrastructure\nAs part of the reform agenda, we must consider how to operationally enhance and optimize tools like the discount window to meet banking system liquidity needs more effectively. This must include ensuring the payments infrastructure that supports bank funding mechanisms is equipped to operate not just during business-as-usual conditions, but especially during stress events. Last year's banking stress clearly demonstrated the need for reforms and updates, but these issues existed long before the bank failures. Some banks encountered frictions in using the discount window that made it less effective, and these frictions potentially exacerbated the stress that some institutions experienced. Limits on the availability of payments services, including Fedwire, may also have interfered with the ability to effectively manage bank liquidity. These issues require a careful and impartial review to understand the facts, particularly if we base reform efforts on the recent events.\nAddressing operational readiness\nMaintenance of existing infrastructure is an often overlooked and sometimes thankless job. When the payments infrastructure works \"well enough,\" as it seemed to do in the lead-up to the spring banking stress, it is easy to take for granted that it will work during times of stress. However, this is an area where we must become more vigilant and avoid complacency.\nWe know that SVB experienced difficulties in accessing discount window loans before its failure. Certainly, there are ways in which the Fed can enhance the technology, the operational readiness, and the services underpinning discount window loans and payment services to ensure that they are available when needed. On this front, I would note that the Federal Reserve recently published a proposal to expand the operating hours of the Fedwire Funds Service and the National Settlement Service (NSS), to operate 22 hours per day, 7 days per week, on a year-round basis.\n2\nThe proposal also requested feedback on whether the discount window should operate during these same expanded hours. The comment period remains open on this proposal, but this seems like it would be a critical improvement, and one that would be responsive to identified shortcomings.\n3\nOther changes are also needed to bring payment services and discount window lending into the 21st century, including modernizing the technology banks use to request loans electronically rather than relying upon a person to answer a telephone call, ensuring that collateral can move freely from the bank or FHLB to the Reserve Bank when needed, and identifying and reducing other areas of friction that banks experience in the use of the discount window. Operational improvements\u00e2\u0080\u0094including technology enhancements and investments\u00e2\u0080\u0094and improving operational readiness within the Federal Reserve System, should underpin any approach to improvements.\nBank liquidity sources\nA critical component of the current reform agenda focuses on the ongoing evolution of bank funding and liquidity sources and mechanisms. Of course, any discussion about the discount window would be incomplete without considering these sources and mechanisms. The discount window is a critical tool, but it does not operate in isolation. It is also intended to be a source of liquidity as a last resort and at a penalty rate, not as a primary funding resource in the normal course of business at a market rate.\nWhile discount window lending can support bank liquidity, it is best thought of as an additional resource in the federal safety net that allows eligible institutions to weather disruptions in liquidity markets and access other resources. Banks have a range of options to manage liquidity needs during business-as-usual operations and during times of stress, including repo markets and FHLB advances. Within this framework, the discount window operates as a backup liquidity authority, a \"last resort\" for funding needs. In evaluating the bank liquidity framework, it is imperative that we consider and understand the interrelationships among these resources, liquidity requirements and regulations, and bank liquidity planning.\n4\nThese resources are complementary, so they must be thought about holistically when discussing and seriously considering changes to requirements. Yet, discussions about reforms are often approached in a piecemeal way.\nSome policymakers have stated that a potential response to the 2023 banking stress would be to require banks to preposition collateral at the Fed's discount window. The notion is that by forcing banks to preposition collateral in this way, banks will have a ready pool of liquidity to draw from during times of stress. This compulsory requirement to preposition collateral, it is argued, could also mitigate some of the stigma associated with using the discount window, and thereby improve its effectiveness.\nSo, we must also ask if the perceived stigma of taking loans from the discount window will be mitigated by requirements to preposition collateral. If the stigma of receiving a discount window loan continues to impede the effectiveness of the Fed serving as a lender of last resort, we must consider other ways to address these stigma concerns. There is no reason for a bank to take a loan at a penalty rate or preposition collateral during periods of calm if the discount window operates effectively and communicates with banks on a regular basis. If the issue is that the window does not operate in an effective manner, requirements to use it will not succeed. Investments must be made to address its operational shortcomings.\nSome reforms, like encouraging bank readiness to borrow from the discount window if that is part of their contingency funding plans, could be explored more thoroughly. If a bank includes the discount window in these plans and intends to use it during stress, the bank should be prepared to do so. But if we are honest, we recognize that our prior efforts to reduce discount window stigma, as during the COVID period, have not been durable or successful.\nThere are a number of reasons a bank could choose to borrow from the discount window, including market disruptions in liquidity access or a scarcity in the total amount of reserves in the banking system and a specific borrower's growing financial stress. To access primary discount window credit, a borrower must meet financial standards for borrowing. In some ways, these financial requirements to access primary credit suggest that an important \"market signal\" of discount window borrowing is related to a market liquidity disruption and may be less of a signal about any individual institution's financial condition. But discount window lending is an additional data point for the market and may be read as a sign of financial distress. This possible interpretation alone may be enough to deter usage of the discount window.\nAs we consider the future of the discount window, we should explore ways to validate the use of discount window lending in our regulatory framework. For example, are there ways to better recognize discount window borrowing capacity in our assessment of a firm's liquidity resources, for example in calculating a firm's compliance with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio?\nAs the resources available for bank funding continue to evolve, including the Federal Housing Finance Administration's (FHFA) active consideration of reforms to FHLB lending standards, we see direct impacts on access to liquidity. Even though the comment period for these changes just concluded on July 15, these significant shifts are already affecting how FHLB members will need to plan to use FHLB advances for liquidity funding.\nMaking regulatory changes to liquidity requirements while the FHFA is shifting FHLB funding prioritization for its members leads to several questions that would need to be answered before engaging in prudent policy-making.\n5\nHow would required collateral prepositioning at the discount window affect the availability or amount of FHLB advances that a bank can rely on for funding purposes? More broadly speaking, how will any requirement to preposition collateral at the discount window affect the availability and use of other funding resources or the day-to-day liquidity management practices of banks? A better approach would be to recognize and understand how the FHLBs support bank liquidity and work together with each FHLB through the Reserve Banks in advance of a bank stress to ensure that mechanisms are in place to facilitate the transfer of collateral to the discount window, and that the Reserve Banks have the appropriate seniority over such collateral. A practical and pragmatic approach will work to preserve the stability of the banking system much more effectively than disrupting the bank liquidity operations of the FHLB system that have been in place since the 1930s.\nWhen it comes to the next steps in liquidity reform, I think it is imperative that we tackle known and identified issues that were exposed during the banking stress in the spring of 2023. This must include updating discount window operations and technology and making sure that payment services are available when needed. But for other reforms, a number of important questions remain unanswered, including understanding both where there are frictions and weaknesses in the current bank",

Waller\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri\nShare\nThank you, Jeff, and thank you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nSo far, 2024 has been a challenging year for economic forecasters, and for monetary policymakers. After significant progress in 2023 toward the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) price-stability goal, inflation jumped in the first quarter. At the same time, both the labor market and economic growth ran strong enough that some commentators wondered whether monetary policy was restrictive enough and whether rate hikes should be back on the table. These twists and turns in the economic data shifted everyone's expectations back and forth as to when the FOMC might begin lowering its policy interest rate and how many cuts there would be this year. During this time, my consistent view was that there was no urgency to cut rates until the Committee is confident that inflation is returning sustainably to 2 percent.\nThen, in the second quarter, data on inflation and the labor market moderated in a way that suggests progress toward price stability has resumed. The data over the past couple months shows the economy growing at a more moderate pace, labor supply and demand apparently in balance, and inflation slowing from earlier this year. These are all developments that support progress toward achieving the FOMC's dual-mandate goals. For reasons that I will elaborate on later, I believe current data are consistent with achieving a soft landing, and I will be looking for data over the next couple months to buttress this view. So, while I don't believe we have reached our final destination, I do believe we are getting closer to the time when a cut in the policy rate is warranted.\nBefore turning to the economic outlook, let me say a word about central bank communication\u00e2\u0080\u0094in particular, communication about the policy path. Central bankers use communications to try, as much as possible, to describe the extent of progress, and even more importantly, the remaining path to the ultimate destination. The problem is that there may not be just one path to the ultimate destination\u00e2\u0080\u0094it depends on the incoming data. For example, when leaving work, you have a normal route to get home, and that is the base case for your estimated commuting time. But that day's traffic conditions will dictate whether you should take that route or an alternative to get home. You need to think about the alternative routes to get home and how long they will take if you are confronted with unexpected congestion. And, most likely, you will also have to communicate these alternative travel plans to family members so they have an idea of when you will arrive and how you will get the kids to after school activities.\nCentral bankers face the same problem: How will you set policy if the data come in different than you expected? It is important to not only lay out your base case, but also alternative paths for policy if your base case is disrupted by incoming data. And for monetary policy, it is even more important to communicate those alternative policy paths to the public so that they can also make plans. So, after reviewing the economic outlook, I will explore three possible data scenarios about inflation for the second half of 2024 and how those differing scenarios affect my view of the appropriate stance of policy.\nEconomic Activity\nLet me start with the economic outlook. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at about a 4 percent annual pace in the second half of 2023 and then significantly slowed to a 1.4 percent rate in the first quarter. Recent forecasts indicate that output grew a little faster in the second quarter. We will get an initial estimate of second-quarter GDP next week, but the Blue Chip average of private-sector forecasts estimates that GDP grew at a 1.8 percent pace in the second quarter, and the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model estimates growth at 2.5 percent. A big reason for the higher GDPNow estimate is because it was updated after yesterday's retail sales report. Digging into that report, one finds that the data directly informing the Bureau of Economic Analysis's estimate of consumer spending posted solid gains for June and revised up sales for both April and May. I suspect that this moderate consumption growth may continue in the second half of the year because personal income data is holding up.\nA signal of possible slowing in economic activity comes from the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) survey of purchasing managers for non-manufacturing firms. Nonmanufacturing firms constitute the large majority of businesses in the economy. The non-manufacturing index fell below 50 in June, suggesting a contraction in activity. As a part of that survey, \"business activity,\" corresponding to production or sales, fell below 50 for the first time since May 2020. The index for new orders fell especially sharply and the employment index fell further into contractionary territory. Clearly, economic activity among these businesses is slowing, but it is too soon to say by how much. Previous months when the overall index fell below 50 were followed by sustained periods above that threshold, so we will have to wait and see what this current reading means for a slowing in this sector. Meanwhile activity among manufacturing businesses has been fairly steady this year after contracting from late 2022 through 2023. New orders and most other readings are close to 50.\nThe Labor Market\nOne development in the past few months with significant implications for monetary policy is that labor supply and demand have finally come into rough balance. Demand of workers exceeded supply for several years, contributing significantly to high wage inflation, which inevitably fed through into services inflation. Supply was damaged after the pandemic, as many people left the workforce to care for family, older workers retired, and immigration fell significantly. At the same time, the economy grew solidly, and labor demand rose at a brisk pace. The imbalance in the labor market was reflected in a surge in job openings, with two vacant jobs for each worker counted as looking for work, nearly double the rate prior to the pandemic. There was also a surge in the number of people quitting their jobs, most of them to take a higher-paying job elsewhere.\nBut now that situation has changed dramatically. Labor supply has improved, with a higher labor force participation rate and much higher rates of immigration. Not long ago, I would have been concerned that the high levels of job creation reported recently were inconsistent with a labor market coming into better balance, but the high pace of immigration in recent quarters helped accommodate the strong demand. And, more recently, as restrictive monetary policy has put downward pressure on aggregate demand, the demand for labor has moderated.\nThe unemployment rate has risen from a 50-year low to 4.1 percent, still low in historical terms but the highest since late 2021. In May, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed people stood at 1.2, which was the average in the year before the pandemic. The share of workers who quit their jobs is now slightly below the pre-pandemic level. One indication that this is a loosening, rather than a weakening, of the labor market is that layoff rates have been more or less steady at the low rate of around 1 percent. To me, this is all evidence of labor supply and demand in balance.\nBack in 2022, I wrote a research note with Fed economist Andrew Figura on the Beveridge curve, which is the relationship between unemployment and the job vacancy rate.\n2\nIn that research, we projected that, if layoffs were steady, the unemployment rate would rise to around 4.5 percent if the job vacancy rate dropped back to its pre-pandemic level of 4.6 percent. The latest data estimated the vacancy rate in May as 4.9 percent, pretty close to the pre-pandemic level. There were some prominent skeptics, but this data tells us that if inflation continues to moderate as it has since May, then we may achieve the soft landing in the labor market that I said back then was possible, with even less of a tradeoff in terms of unemployment.\nAnother sign of balance in the labor market is that wage growth has continued to slow. The twelve-month change in average hourly earnings has slowed from its peak of about 6 percent in March 2022, to 4.3 percent by December 2023, and is down to 3.9 percent as of June. The three-month increase through June was running at an annual pace of 3.6 percent, which is close to what I judge is the rate needed to support inflation running at 2 percent in a sustained way. And this interpretation is consistent with other measures that suggest wage growth is back to its pre-pandemic level.\nSo what lies ahead for the labor market? Right now, the labor market is in a sweet spot\u00e2\u0080\u0094employment growth is not excessive when accounting for immigration, nominal wage growth is near the rate consistent with price stability, the unemployment rate is close to what is thought of as its long run value, the job vacancy rate is near its pre-pandemic level and the involuntary layoff rate has held steady at 1 percent for over 2 years. In terms of the employment leg of the dual mandate, we may well be able to achieve the soft landing.\nBut we need to keep the labor market in this sweet spot. As my research note highlighted, the history of the Beveridge curve indicates that, given the normalization of the labor market, a continued decline in the job vacancy rate and the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio may lead to a larger increase in unemployment than we have seen the past two years. In short, one implication of a balanced labor market is that the risk of it becoming\ntoo loose\nis more closely balanced with the risk of it being too tight. This is a policy challenge that we have not faced for the past couple years. As of today, I see there is more upside risk to unemployment than we have seen for a long time.\nInflation\nLet me now turn to the outlook for inflation. After making progress last year toward our 2 percent goal, early this year I was concerned that progress might have stalled. But data in recent months has been reassuring. Last week's consumer price index (CPI) report was the second month of very good news. It showed that total consumer prices fell in June, after staying flat in May. This means that CPI inflation for the 12-months through June declined to 3 percent, while the 3-month annualized change dropped to 1.1 percent. For consumers who have been dealing with prices that are still significantly higher than before the pandemic, this is good news, and with continuing solid gains in wages and other income, over time I hope it will begin to feel like the level of prices is becoming more manageable.\nFor policymakers, this was also welcome news. Factoring out energy and food prices, which tend to be volatile, core CPI inflation rose only 0.1 percent last month, the slowest pace since the pandemic. This brings 3-month annualized core inflation down to an annual rate of 2.1 percent. Based on the consumer and producer price data reported last week, private sector forecasters are predicting that the FOMC's preferred inflation gauge based on personal consumer expenditures (PCE) rose 0.1 percent in June and that core PCE inflation rose 0.2 percent.\nSo, after disappointing data to begin 2024, we now have a couple of months of data that I view as being more consistent with the steady progress we saw last year in reducing inflation, and also consistent with the FOMC's price stability goal. The evidence is mounting that the first quarter inflation data may have been an aberration and that the effects of tighter monetary policy have corralled high inflation. To see this, consider the average monthly rate of core PCE inflation over the past 18 months. In the first quarter of 2023 it averaged 0.4 percent, and then 0.3 percent, 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent over the remaining quarters of the year. Core PCE inflation jumped to a monthly average of 0.4 percent in the first quarter of this year but is now estimated to be back to 0.2 percent last quarter. Most importantly, I don't have to look at the second decimal place to see progress! The recent data are making me more confident we will achieve the inflation goal of our dual mandate.\nMonetary Policy\nNow let me turn to the implications of this data for monetary policy. As I noted earlier, the changes in the data this year have made it hard to formulate an outlook for policy that would apply to the range of possible paths the economy may take. That range of possibilities must consider two risks.\nOn the one hand, it is essential that monetary policy get inflation down to a sustained level of 2 percent. If we start to loosen policy too soon, and allow inflation to flare up again, we risk losing credibility with the public and allowing expectations of future inflation to become unanchored. That credibility has helped inflation fall as quickly as it has in the past 18 months and squandering it would be a grave mistake. Monthly PCE inflation has very recently been running near 2 percent at an annual rate, but I need to see a bit more evidence that this will be sustained. The other risk is that we wait too long to ease monetary policy and contribute to a significant economic slowdown or a recession, with unemployment rising notably.\nWith those two risks in mind, let me lay out three scenarios for the economy this year that would result in leading me to different views about appropriate policy. One assumption I make is that there is no significant deterioration in the labor market in the next several months\u00e2\u0080\u0094that we are able to keep the labor market in its current sweet spot. While I believe this is likely, I will be paying close attention to the employment side of our mandate.\nThe first scenario is the optimistic one. Here we continue to receive more very favorable CPI inflation reports, with implications for very favorable PCE inflation readings as well. This would give us a nice run of inflation data starting in May. I see a significant but not high probability of this scenario occurring. And, in that circumstance, I would have much greater confidence in inflation moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In this scenario, I could envision a rate cut in the not-too-distant future.\nThe second scenario is a bit less optimistic but probably more likely to occur. In this case, the inflation data comes in uneven\u00e2\u0080\u0094not as good as the previous few months but still consistent overall with progress on bringing inflation down toward 2 percent. Here, with the uneven data, it would be a matter of timing as to when I th",

Kugler\nAt the 21st Annual Economic Measurement Seminar, National Association for Business Economics Foundation, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nThank you for your generous introduction, Ellen. I am delighted to be here with the National Association for Business Economics (NABE), and, in particular, I am pleased to be speaking at a conference covering an issue that is close to my heart and on which I have spent many years working: economic measurement.\nWhen Federal Reserve officials tell audiences that their judgments are data dependent, some skeptics perhaps presume that monetary policy is already on a path set in stone. But most in this room likely know what I mean when I talk about data dependence. I am a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which, of course, pursues a dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices.\n1\nWhen I say I am data dependent, that means I am considering the totality of the data\u00e2\u0080\u0094the full range of economic indicators that provide a sense of where the labor market, economic activity, financial conditions, and inflation have been and where they might be going. Policymakers must have high-quality and accurate data to understand the economy and set the correct policy.\nThe truth is that it is not just the Fed that needs data. Consumers, businesses, investors, and others have access to more information than ever before when making decisions. It is incumbent on economists, private- and public-sector data collectors, and others to ensure that available data are carefully collected, accurately measured, and clearly presented, and that data collection and measurement efforts are further enhanced and continue to improve.\nTo be sure, data collection and economic measurement can be challenging, and different types of data face pros and cons, which is why I take an expansive approach to using data, as I will explain a bit later. But I will begin by highlighting a few challenges to economic measurement. I will then provide some examples of how those challenges might be addressed. I will also provide examples of how nontraditional data generated by the private sector can help provide additional angles from which to view aspects of the economy that may not be clear in data produced by government statistical agencies. Finally, I will offer some examples of how, in recent years, our statistical agencies have adapted and innovated, sometimes by incorporating private-sector data to address specific measurement challenges I have in mind. To be clear, my interest in nontraditional data is not a critique of the statistical agencies. To the contrary, official data are critically important to policymakers, researchers, and the public. Rather, I view public and private data as being complementary and helping to provide a more complete picture of the economy.\nImportance of Data\nEconomic measurement, the task some of you contribute to every day, is at the core of real-time policy analysis and forecasting. We at the Board of Governors rely on a broad array of data produced by both government and the private sector. And we carefully scrutinize every important economic release and are very familiar with the methodological details of those reports. Suffice it to say, we care a lot about economic measurement at the Fed.\nAnd the Fed itself produces many important data series, including two principal federal economic indicators: the Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization report and the Consumer Credit statistical releases.\n2\nIn addition, our website features numerous other data products that look at bank assets, liabilities, and structure; monetary aggregates; international finance; business finance; and household finance\u00e2\u0080\u0094including data on the level, share, and composition of wealth for households at different points in the wealth and income distribution, as well as for different demographic groups.\n3\nThe Board also conducts separate surveys of consumers and household economic decision making and surveys of loan officers and credit officers, well known as the SLOOS and the SCOOS. Beyond the Federal Reserve Board, each of the Federal Reserve Banks engages in measurement and data production of various kinds, including closely watched surveys of firms and households. For example, the New York Fed conducts a survey of consumer expectations, which was just released last week, the Atlanta Fed tracks wage data, the Richmond Fed surveys firms on price-setting behavior, among other things, and several Reserve Banks publish alternative measures of inflation and reports on factory and business activity in their regions.\nChallenges with Measurement\nOf course, as one reviews various sources of data, one can see that there are some common measurement challenges. I will mention a few. These are not new, nor is my list exhaustive. My intent here is to focus on challenges that highlight the tradeoffs in using public and private data and to show how these sources of data complement each other.\nThe first challenge I will identify is that traditional measurement approaches sometimes struggle to track rapidly changing economic developments. This was the case early in the pandemic and is often true at turning points in the business cycle. Of course, it is at those very moments when policymakers, and the public, are most critically interested in how the economy is faring. The reasons for this lag are well known. Statistical agencies can only survey households and businesses every so often, and it takes time to compile and publish high-quality statistics. However, financial markets and business decisions move quickly. Reports produced on a monthly or quarterly basis, often with a multi-week lag, may not be available with sufficient frequency to inform real-time decisions. Also, some indicators, by design, take on new market information slowly. A recent and relevant example is housing services inflation, as measured as part of the consumer price index (CPI) and the personal consumption expenditures price index. Both rely heavily on slowly changing leasing agreements that only adjust to market conditions over many months. Business entries and exits, sometimes called births and deaths, are similar in that they take time to appear in surveys that underlie important statistical products. I will touch on that a bit more later.\nA second challenge is that many statistical reports were created decades ago and may not be focused on newer or growing sectors of the economy. For example, there are monthly reports on factory orders, shipments, inventories, and output among the principal economic indicators. Because developments in the goods sector can matter importantly for economic fluctuations, that level of detail is indeed helpful to have. But we would benefit from the same depth of information on domestically produced services, too. While service-sector output constitutes a larger share of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), the category has only one single dedicated quarterly report, even though much of the post-pandemic recovery requires us to understand how services consumption and employment have evolved. For example, did you know that quarterly hog and pig counts are a principal economic indicator? Yet, there is not a regular government report specifically dedicated to the gig economy. I am certainly glad we collect data for important agricultural commodities, but I think we should probably be examining the large and diverse gig economy as much as we do the pig economy. I believe the statistical agencies grapple with these issues, and it takes time to lay the groundwork and develop new data series, but this challenge is a real one. If reports are built for the past, that may mean they struggle to capture big developments today and in the future, such as the changing nature of where and how people work or the rising use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\nFinally, there is an impediment that everyone here is acutely aware of: These challenges are made even more difficult because official surveys have seen declining survey response rates. That results in lower precision of statistical estimates and can lead to the need for further, costly surveys to collect the necessary amount of information, as one may need to conduct several rounds of data collection before having sufficiently large samples that can provide reliable estimates. Declining response rates may also be selective and pose a challenge to representing the broader population. Innovative methods for data collection and behavioral interventions to encourage survey responses can be used to address concerns and are being tried in some cases by statistical agencies.\nA Data Explosion\nWhile these challenges in traditional data that I have described may take some time to be addressed, I am encouraged by the explosion in data produced by the private sector over the past decade or so that can greatly enhance our understanding of the economy. Such data give an opportunity to measure economic developments with greater timeliness, at a higher frequency, and with more granularity. That said, those data often face their own challenges, including issues with representativeness, the lack of methodological consistency, and a short time-series history. Nevertheless, such nontraditional data can be helpful, especially when used jointly with official statistics to which these new sources can be benchmarked.\nA prominent example of valuable private-sector data is employment statistics from payroll providers. Such weekly data allowed economists at the Federal Reserve Board to understand, essentially in real time, employment losses when the pandemic first took hold in the United States in March 2020. In comparison, it took until early May to get similar information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) employment report.\n4\nIndeed, in trying to understand the rapidly changing economy during the pandemic, Fed economists closely followed a variety of privately produced higher-frequency data. These included reports on restaurant reservations, hotel occupancy, and airport passengers. Economists even used anonymized phone-tracking data to estimate business shutdown rates and trends in retail spending.\n5\nCredit and debit card transaction data are another example of a helpful, private-sector tool that economists use to understand consumer behavior in various sectors or regions in close to real time. These figures provided what proved to be a pretty reliable picture of economic developments during the pandemic, well before traditional statistics\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as quarterly GDP and monthly retail sales\u00e2\u0080\u0094became available.\n6\nThe need for timely, high-frequency information is not limited to pandemics and turns in the national business cycle. For example, Federal Reserve Board economists have used credit and debit card transaction data to estimate the effects of local natural disasters almost in real time when official statistics are often not available.\n7\nWhen we look at economic turning points, it is also important to consider reports on expectations and anticipated outcomes from nongovernment sources. Those include surveys of expectations of future inflation, anticipated hiring or layoffs, and consumer and business sentiment on the economy or the path of the economy. I pay close attention to these surveys because they are forward looking and help inform where behaviors by businesses and households may be trending.\nTracking supply chains is another area where private-sector sources have proved extremely valuable, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. One important source of such data is the Institute for Supply Management's surveys of purchasing managers. While those series are well established and closely followed, Fed economists found them particularly helpful in recent years to observe supplier delivery times, order backlogs, items in short supply, and measures of inventory satisfaction. Other private-sector data give economists insight into supply chains as well, including measures of air, sea and overland freight costs; the number of waiting container ships; and the volume of railroad traffic. These data series offered additional details on the level of constraint in supply chains following the pandemic shock, alongside reports from official statistical agencies.\nI will offer two additional examples of how I use nontraditional data at the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0094one from each side of our dual mandate. To better understand the labor market, I have been watching job vacancy, quit, and layoff data closely for many years. The official government source for this information is the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). While extremely important, JOLTS data are released with a lag of more than a month. And this survey has seen a particularly large decline in response rates.\n8\nThis instance turned out to be another example of where private data could enhance my understanding. Job search sites' data on postings are updated more frequently than the federal report and generally confirm that JOLTS measurement appears to be accurate. Similarly, JOLTS data on layoffs are lagged. That is why I also look at other figures, including unemployment insurance claims; Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, notices; employment reductions from the Institute for Supply Management; anticipated layoffs from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas; and mentions of layoffs in earnings reports and the Beige Book.\nWith inflation, an important component to track recently has been housing services costs, which is typically the single largest expense for U.S. households. Housing services are a big reason why the overall inflation rate remains above our 2 percent target. The official measures of housing services inflation are intended to capture overall growth of housing costs\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, costs incurred by owners and renters\u00e2\u0080\u0094drawing from a survey of rental lease terms. But rental leases tend to change only gradually, so the official measures can significantly lag current market conditions. That is why policymakers can also rely on current market rent data, showing what landlords charge new tenants, information that is available from multiple private-sector sources. Those data can provide some early signal of where official housing inflation series are likely headed.\nHere I have mentioned just a handful of private-sector data examples. But each of these helps address measurement challenges I mentioned earlier. From these data, we can gain timeliness and higher frequency, with a better read on underlying economic dynamics like market pricing. And with often low survey response rates in official data, these private-sector sources may provide another perspect",

Cook\nAt the Australian Conference of Economists 2024, Adelaide, Australia\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Jacky. I am happy to be here in Adelaide and appreciate the opportunity to speak with all of you.\n1\nConsidering the significant developments in the global economy over the past few years, now is an appropriate time to reflect on the economic reverberations the COVID-19 shock caused around the world. Examining the common inflation experiences and monetary policy challenges across several countries, including Australia and the United States, is a helpful exercise for policymakers and economists alike. Today, I will first talk about how monetary policymakers responded in similar fashion to the COVID-19 pandemic and, later, to high inflation during the recovery. I will discuss common features of the recent inflation experience across countries and the importance of global shocks. With disinflation in train across most countries, I will consider what we can learn from past cycles of monetary easing. I will finish with a discussion of how the use of alternative scenarios could help monetary policymakers communicate how they might respond to a range of possible economic outcomes.\nCommon Monetary Policy Response to the Pandemic\nIn the spring of 2020, economies around the world shut down or sharply limited business activity, especially for in-person services, including dining out and traveling. Governments introduced extraordinary fiscal support aimed at alleviating the socioeconomic effects of the pandemic. And, to prevent sharp financial and economic deterioration, most central banks responded aggressively by lowering policy rates, ramping up asset purchases, and taking other actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. Those efforts were sustained throughout 2020 and much of 2021, as the initial turmoil in financial markets subsided but the health situation remained uncertain.\n*\nAdvanced economy central banks that had positive policy rates before the pandemic, including the Fed and the central banks of Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, cut these rates to near zero, as shown in\nfigure 1.\nCentral banks that entered the pandemic with policy rates already at zero, such as Sweden, or negative\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the euro area, Japan, and Switzerland\u00e2\u0080\u0094left their rates unchanged. Meanwhile, almost all emerging market economy (EME) central banks cut their policy rates. Although central banks acted quickly to reduce rates, policymakers cited a few reasons to refrain from deeper cuts: Among EME policymakers, concerns were expressed that further lowering rates risked exacerbating capital outflows, while some advanced economy central banks commented that further rate cuts, particularly in negative territory, could harm banks' financial health or would provide little additional monetary stimulus.\nMany central banks also conducted significant asset purchases. These purchases were initially aimed at restoring market functioning and providing liquidity, but they also were seen as lowering long-term yields and easing broader financial conditions. The Fed and the Bank of England (BOE) restarted their purchases, while the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swedish Riksbank increased the pace of their existing programs. And here, the Reserve Bank of Australia began asset purchases and introduced a target for the three-year government bond yield at the same level as its overnight rate.\nThe Rise of Inflation and the Common Monetary Policy Response\nOver the course of 2021, as financial conditions improved, a strong recovery in consumer demand outpaced still constrained supply capacity in many countries, leading to production and transportation bottlenecks, which ultimately resulted in inflation. The surge in inflation was initially mostly concentrated in finished goods and commodities but later spread to services.\n2\nAs the economy started reopening with the lifting of lockdowns and rollout of vaccines, demand for services picked up. Similar to what played out with goods, the pickup in demand for services ran into a constrained supply of service workers. As services are more labor intensive than goods, and labor supply was still reeling from the consequences of the pandemic, the rebalancing of consumption from goods to services led to higher rates of inflation and nominal wage growth.\nIn response to rising inflation, central banks around the world started to remove some of the support that they provided during the height of the pandemic. As a first step, central banks let many of the emergency support programs\u00e2\u0080\u0094in which they had bought assets other than national government bonds\u00e2\u0080\u0094expire. Next, central banks generally began to taper their purchases of government securities and then to end net purchases late in 2021 or the first half of 2022.\nThen some central banks began to raise interest rates. The first to do so were EME central banks that saw particularly sharp increases in inflation driven by exchange rate depreciation and by the surge in prices for food, which makes up a large part of the consumption baskets in their economies. Advanced economy central banks generally were more patient on raising interest rates in 2021, as inflation expectations in their economies were better anchored than in emerging economies. Among advanced economy central banks, the first to hike in the autumn of 2021 were central banks in Norway and New Zealand, whose economies had strong recoveries. The BOE first raised its policy rate in December 2021, citing a strong labor market and sharply rising inflation. The Bank of Canada and the Fed began to raise rates in March 2022, and the ECB first raised its deposit rate (from negative 0.5 percent to zero) in July 2022. Most advanced economy central banks undertook a sequence of policy actions in which they first began to raise their policy rates and later began to reduce the size of their balance sheets over time.\nUnderstanding the Rise and Fall of Inflation in Recent Years\nThe inflation surge in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic was synchronized across advanced and emerging economies, as\nfigure 2\nillustrates. The rapid increase in prices reflected an upswing in demand for goods, strained supply chains, tight labor markets, and sharp hikes in commodity prices exacerbated by Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The run-up was not only for overall headline inflation, but also for its core components.\nA plethora of factors can explain the global co-movement in headline and core inflation. First, fluctuations in global food and energy prices broadly pass through to consumer prices in individual countries. But there are other possible explanations, including global supply constraints and synchronous policy responses. The pandemic experience was also a stark reminder of the importance of international trade and input-output linkages for the propagation of supply shocks\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, production and shipping disruptions in the semiconductor industry in Asia constraining production and creating important price pressures in downstream markets, such as motor vehicles in the U.S.\nResearch on the recent inflation episode is still very much in its infancy, and I look forward to learning from the ongoing work on the subject. One important contribution already is Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard's analysis of pandemic-era inflation in 11 economies. Separate teams for each of the 11 economies estimated a comparable model of inflation and its drivers. They find for the U.S. and, with some variation, for other countries that \"relative price shocks and sectoral shortages drove the initial surge in inflation, but as these effects have reversed, tight labor markets in most (although not all) countries have become a relatively more important factor.\"\n3\nIn a recent FEDS Notes article, economists at the Federal Reserve Board took head-on the task of decomposing world inflation into common and country-specific components and using this decomposition to analyze the sources of inflation around the world.\n4\nDespite the different approach, they reached conclusions broadly in line with those of Bernanke and Blanchard. As shown in\nfigure 3\n, they find that the global components of inflation accounted for a large part of the variation in the average inflation around the world during the post-COVID period. This is an experience with precedents during the oil price shocks of the 1970s and the 1980s.\nThis study also found that the global components of inflation also predict the path of near-term inflation. Historically, once global components start moving, they maintain the course and take time to reverse. This persistence and the recent decline in global components of core and noncore inflation suggest that the world disinflationary process will continue, as shown in\nfigure 4\n. The predicted path is in line with a gradual return of inflation toward central bank targets.\nOf note, as shown in\nfigure 5\n, the authors find that the post-pandemic rise in global inflation was linked to both commodity-driven price shocks and shocks to global economic activity\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as the sharp decline and rebound in activity due to the COVID\u00e2\u0080\u009119 pandemic and the associated labor market shortages. This situation contrasts with the 1970s and 1980s, when commodity price shocks played a prominent role in inflation's fluctuations. Additionally, idiosyncratic shocks were important drivers of the surge in global inflation in 2022 and its decline in 2023. These shocks may capture economy-specific forces, including natural gas disruptions that more greatly affected European economies than others in the aftermath of Russia's war on Ukraine.\nIn sum, through the lens of the model, the ongoing disinflation is driven by waning effects of commodity price shocks and by a gradual normalization of global economic activity, amid the resolution of shortages and imbalances in labor markets.\nCurrent Common Monetary Policy Challenges\nWith global components of inflation turning down, most countries have experienced a significant fall in inflation relative to its peak. Similarly, most central banks stopped raising their policy rates over the past year. Some are considering how long to keep rates at restrictive levels or, if inflation picks up again, whether to raise rates further. The Bank of Canada, the ECB, the Swedish Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank, have begun to cut policy rates, highlighting progress toward meeting inflation goals amid sustained softness in economic activity. Indeed, unlike in the U.S., the level of gross domestic product (GDP) in some advanced economies remains well below what would be implied by their respective pre-COVID GDP trends.\n5\nEven among those cutting rates, however, the future path of the policy rate is generally seen as dependent on a continuing decline of inflation toward target levels.\nFor all central banks, the question is how best to ensure continued disinflation while avoiding unnecessary damage to the economy. The generally desired outcome is a soft landing, in which inflation returns to the central bank's target inflation level or range without inducing a recession or a large increase in unemployment. How likely is such a scenario? It may be too soon to definitively say for the current economic cycle. But Fed Board staff have examined past episodes of monetary policy easing in 13 advanced economies over the past five decades. They find that soft landings are rare, according to their analysis published in another recent FEDS Notes article.\n6\nIn most of the cases that they studied, central banks were not successful in bringing inflation back to near target in a timely manner. And when they were successful in taming inflation, it often was associated with a recession.\nHowever, soft landings are not unprecedented. When such a landing occurred, on average it was associated with a smaller preceding policy tightening. Soft landings were also more likely when policy easing began with inflation already close to target and when there was a relatively firm growth backdrop. In the U.S., what I have seen so far appears to be consistent with a soft landing: Inflation has fallen significantly from its peak, and the labor market has gradually cooled but remains strong. Of course, I am closely monitoring incoming data to see how the economy further develops.\nIt is possible that some features of the recent inflation episode may make a soft landing more likely in countries around the globe. As I discussed, Bernanke and Blanchard found that much of the inflation episode came from relative price shocks and sectoral shortages that have since been resolved. And while they found that tight labor markets have since taken over as the main drivers of inflation, there are signs that such tightness is easing. For instance, in the U.S., the ratio of vacancies to unemployment has fallen back to its pre-pandemic level and the rate of voluntary quits has declined, as workers are less confident of finding a better job. Thus, my baseline forecast (and that of many outside observers) is that inflation will continue to move toward target over time, without much further rise in unemployment.\nMonetary Policy Communications\nOf course, forecasts are subject to considerable uncertainty, and policymakers must consider a range of possible outcomes. A key challenge of monetary policy communications is discussing how policy would respond to changes in the economic outlook. Central bankers are faced with a tradeoff between predictability and flexibility. On the one hand, many observers would like to know in advance what the path for the policy rate will be, while, on the other hand, a central bank needs to remain nimble and data dependent. As a result, central bankers often try to convey their \"reaction function\" so observers understand how policy might adapt to incoming data and the implications for the economic outlook.\nIn his recent review of forecasting for monetary policymaking and communications at the BOE, Ben Bernanke suggested that the Bank consider supplementing its published forecasts with the use of alternative scenarios to help the public understand its policy reaction function.\n7\nFor similar reasons I try to incorporate a discussion of alternative scenarios in my own speeches. Fed policymakers, like those at many other central banks, also benefit from staff analysis using models to explore how the forecast would change relative to the baseline if certain assumptions are changed. The challenge is how to use such alternative scenarios in our official communications.\nPolicy communications are an area where we can learn a lot from what other central banks have done, and communication practices",

It is really a pleasure to join you in Chicago for this year's\nFed Listens\nevent.\n1\nWhen we started\nFed Listens\nback in 2019, the initiative was part of a broad, comprehensive review of the decisionmaking framework we use to pursue our monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability. In the years that followed, we have met with people from across the country and from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences to learn about how the economy has been recovering from the COVID experience.\nEach\nFed Listens\nevent created a wonderful opportunity to take a step back, to ask questions of those who are directly impacted by our policies and the prevailing economic conditions, and then really\nlisten\nto their feedback. I am extremely proud that\nFed Listens\nhas grown and developed into an ongoing venue for the Federal Reserve Board and the Reserve Banks to foster an ongoing conversation and discussion with those who are directly experiencing current economic conditions.\nAs many of you may recall, at last year's\nFed Listens\nevent here in Chicago, we discussed youth employment and joining the labor force following the pandemic, which were especially inspiring. So, in that spirit, today is not only a wonderful opportunity to continue this important conversation in the Seventh District, but also an opportunity to dig deeper into issues that affect local families through the childcare industry, working parents, and employers.\nAustan and I enjoyed getting to know our panelists better earlier today, and I am looking forward to learning more about their experiences through the upcoming panels and discussions. I am also very pleased to welcome our audience\u00e2\u0080\u0094both in person and those tuning in online. I view\nFed Listens\nas an excellent example of Board and System convenings that enable us to gain important insights about economic conditions by engaging directly with those experiencing the economy.\nAs you all know, Fed officials and economists review a vast amount of economic data on a regular basis. Discussions like those we will engage in today provide color and context to supplement the other economic data we monitor. Your perspectives help us gain deeper insights into how we are meeting our dual mandate of maintaining maximum employment and stable prices.\nA better understanding of a wide variety of this type of data, from the considerations families face in making spending decisions (including the costs of childcare) to factors weighed by business owners in applying for loans and offering benefits to help attract top talent, all provide better insight into our data collection. These conversations help us to gain perspective on how Americans in different areas of the country are faring. Some of the issues discussed today may be unique to the Seventh District, but certainly many of these themes and dynamics are present throughout the country and across all 12 Federal Reserve Districts. Seeking out local perspectives is one of the great advantages of the Federal Reserve System's regional structure and of the\nFed Listens\nstructure in particular.\nEarlier, I had the pleasure to meet each of the panelists you'll hear from today. Their varied experiences and backgrounds across sectors lay an important foundation for today's discussion. We hope that our attendees will also join in to share your own observations as you experience these issues in your own lives, businesses, and communities. Your perspective will help to inform our work as policymakers with the responsibility to promote a strong and vibrant economy for all Americans.\nSo with that, I would like to say, thank you again, Austan, and especially to recognize your entire Chicago Fed team for hosting this\nFed Listens\nevent today and for the opportunity to be part of this discussion.\nWithout further ado, I am delighted to get our conversation started by turning things over to Robin Newberger, who is a policy advisor here at the Chicago Fed.\n1.

Bowman\nAt Financial Inclusion Practices and Innovations, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nGood afternoon and welcome back to the second half of today's conference on Financial Inclusion Practices and Innovations.\n1\nIt is really a pleasure to join you to discuss this important topic. This morning, our panelists provided their perspectives on issues related to supervision and regulation and payment frictions and innovations both domestically and internationally. The research and perspectives they discussed can certainly help to broaden our understanding of financial inclusion and all of the associated challenges. Together, our work to promote initiatives that further this work will enable greater access to financial services. An economy that works for everyone necessarily includes a more inclusive financial system. More expansive inclusion opportunities improve the financial well-being of both consumers and small businesses, thereby contributing to overall economic growth.\nToday, I would like to highlight the excellent work being done in this area by our Division of Consumer and Community Affairs (DCCA). I will also touch on some ways that the banking system and private sector can support financial inclusion.\nPromoting an Inclusive Financial System Is a Foundational Element of DCCA's Work\nBefore discussing our work at the Federal Reserve, I would like to first take a step back to anchor financial inclusion within the broader objective of fostering an economy that works for everyone. A healthy and robust U.S. economy relies upon broad access to financial resources and education. Bringing consumers and small businesses into the financial mainstream helps them more fully engage in the financial system and the economy and should help to facilitate the more effective operation of the U.S. economy. Through its responsibility for community affairs, DCCA works to achieve a thorough understanding of current community conditions and best practices by conducting research and convening relevant private sector participants.\nToday, we will focus on their important work to enhance financial access. As the chair of the Consumer and Community Affairs Committee, I oversee these efforts. As many of you know well, DCCA's financial inclusion work is expansive, and I look forward to highlighting these contributions with you today.\nFirst, DCCA informs internal and external stakeholders by leveraging its research and analysis to provide information that can be utilized by external stakeholders to support their work. For example, one of the Fed's most important contributions to the study of financial well-being is the annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, or the SHED. We published the 11th annual report in May. The report addresses topics including financial well-being, savings, retirement, economic fragility, education, and student loans.\n2\nThe Federal Reserve System also conducts an annual Small Business Credit Survey (SBCS), which is a survey of over 6,000 firms with fewer than 500 employees located throughout the country. This year's survey found that many small businesses were experiencing tight financial conditions and often had to rely on personal financial resources, such as personal funds or a loan from family or friends, to support their businesses.\n3\nBecause access to credit is fundamental to broader financial access and inclusion, this experience of reliance on personal financial resources shows that the credit needs of small businesses may not be fully met by the financial industry.\nAnother way DCCA pursues greater financial inclusion is by convening, informing, and engaging with stakeholders. For example, the Community Advisory Council (CAC), which consists of members of the non-profit sector and hands-on community development practitioners, meets with the Board of Governors twice each year to share their experiences and observations and to engage on challenges facing the consumers and communities they serve. The CAC focuses on the concerns of low- and moderate-income people, and at its most recent meeting in May, the CAC focused on a range of economic matters continuing to affect financially vulnerable communities.\nDCCA also prioritizes the work of mission-driven organizations in its efforts to expand financial inclusion. The Partnership for Progress (PFP) program is the Federal Reserve's Minority Depository Institution (MDI) outreach program created to support the System's mandate to preserve and promote MDIs. DCCA, in collaboration with other areas of the Federal Reserve, engages MDIs and Women-Owned Depository Institutions (WDIs) through national outreach efforts. The PFP provides technical assistance to help MDIs and WDIs address unique business model challenges, enabling these institutions to compete more effectively in the marketplace.\n4\nThird, DCCA ensures that financial institutions under the Fed's jurisdiction comply with laws and regulations that protect consumers and promote community development, including fair lending laws and the prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts and practices. For example, DCCA examines state member banks for compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibits discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction based on race, gender, marital status, age, or another prohibited basis. The division's work to protect consumers from harm furthers our goal to create an economy that works for everyone.\nRegulated Financial Institutions and Financial Inclusion\nI would like to turn now to share some thoughts about how the private sector can engage to support financial inclusion. The U.S. banking system is well-positioned to bring consumers into the financial mainstream by providing innovative solutions to meet the credit needs of their communities. For example, banks help consumers and small businesses by providing financial products and services that are safe, fair, and responsive, including through small dollar loan products. These types of loans can help consumers and small businesses access credit for unexpected expenses.\nData from the most recent SHED report found that 10 percent of adults with family incomes less than $50,000 per year used payday, pawn, auto title, or tax refund anticipation loans to obtain needed funds.\n5\nThese types of products often carry high or even punitive direct and indirect costs and risks to the consumer. For example, non-repayment of an auto title loan can lead to vehicle repossession further complicating the consumer's financial situation. When banks offer small dollar loans, they can often do so on terms that are safer and at lower cost than other types of loans.\n6\nSome banks that offer small dollar loan products often use automated underwriting based on alternative information that can include consumer-permissioned cash-flow data. If used appropriately, this approach can reduce bank underwriting costs, potentially making affordably priced loans available to consumers on a more timely basis. If these loans were more available in the banking system, they could serve as an alternative to more costly options from alternative financial services providers. Small dollar loans targeted to low- and moderate-income consumers have the potential to provide an accessible and more fairly priced alternative when consumers experience a financial emergency.\nRemittances and Financial Inclusion\nAs we heard from our panelists earlier today, payments inclusion can look different in domestic and international contexts, but a reliable, safe, and cost-efficient payment system that minimizes unintended frictions is important to consumers around the world. International remittances can serve an important role in enhancing financial inclusion, especially in countries where these funds are a significant source of household financial support. And some research indicates that the ability to receive remittances increases the likelihood of bank account ownership, which furthers economic engagement.\n7\nHowever, for those who send funds abroad using remittances, the costs can be substantial. For example, the average cost of sending $200 internationally from the U.S. is nearly 6 percent.\n8\nIn addition to broader work on cross-border payments, the G20 countries have reaffirmed a commitment to reducing average remittance fees to below 3 percent by 2030. This could result in a greater proportion of funds reaching recipients.\n9\nContinued improvements to domestic and international payment systems and responsible innovation can further support our work on financial inclusion.\nConclusion\nGreater inclusiveness in the financial system is an ongoing priority for the Federal Reserve. While we have made great progress, there is more to be done for both the public and private sectors. We should be open to considering how new or innovative products and services could promote financial inclusion. We should also be willing to engage with a wide range of stakeholders. Financial access and inclusion are not one-size-fits-all and can look very different to each consumer. Therefore, involving consumers and communities in identifying issues and crafting solutions is critical to success. Advancing financial inclusion will clearly take many hands and a diverse set of stakeholders, including everyone participating here today.\n1.

Barr\nAt Financial Inclusion Practices and Innovations Conference, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Art, and let me say how excited I am to be a part of the Federal Reserve Board's inaugural conference on financial inclusion and innovation.\n1\nFinancial inclusion is central to the Federal Reserve's mission of promoting a strong and stable financial system and a healthy economy that works for everyone. This event brings together academics, practitioners, and thought leaders to discuss how financial products and practices are evolving to better meet the needs of individuals and businesses historically underserved by the financial system.\nI have spent much of my career in the public sector and academia working on topics related to financial inclusion. I've found that projects that bring together public, private, academic, and nonprofit perspectives are often the most productive, since we all approach the issue differently and can learn from each other's perspectives. Forums like these provide good opportunities to form connections and spark collaboration.\nLooking over the past few decades, significant progress has been made in improving financial inclusion, including progress on many of the issues that will be discussed at this conference. And yet we still have further to go. Continued support for responsible innovation in this space is needed and can benefit from engagement across industry, academia, and regulators. This morning, I will touch on how approaches to financial inclusion have evolved, where things stand today, and how we can continue progress toward a more inclusive financial system.\nAdvancing the Goals of Financial Inclusion\nThe goal of financial inclusion is to improve access to affordable financial services that meet the needs of individuals and businesses. Banking the unbanked is part of that, but we also need to make sure that both bank and nonbank products and services are designed to meet the financial service needs of low- and moderate-income households. And we need strong consumer protections to guard against abuse.\nBanks are playing a pivotal role in innovating to serve low- and moderate-income households, sometimes in partnership with financial technology companies, or fintechs. For example, we have seen a growing number of banks offering small-dollar loans, expanding use of alternative data to underwrite and price their credit products, and investing in tools to help better understand consumers' financial health. When adopted in a responsible and well-managed manner\u00e2\u0080\u0094with systems, processes, and policies in place to monitor and manage related risks\u00e2\u0080\u0094these innovations can broaden access to fair, affordable, and transparent bank-provided credit. This in turn can create financial resilience among small businesses and help individuals and families become homeowners, build wealth, and become financially empowered.\nThe Importance of Durable Inclusion\nInnovations in banking services are important to improving financial inclusion. But to have a durable impact on society, innovations must be adopted responsibly. Banks must have controls to manage risks and prevent violations of law, and their approach must keep pace with the growth of new products and services. Complexity can exacerbate risks and requires banks to pay particular attention to ensure that laws are followed and customers protected. To the extent banks are working with fintech partners, banks have a responsibility to manage the risks associated with the third parties they partner with to serve their customers.\nWe have, unfortunately, seen examples of failures of banks to effectively manage the risks of partnerships with other companies that support services to their end customers, and these failures have resulted in customer harm. In communities where people are living on tight budgets or with limited access to financial services, disruptions of this kind can be catastrophic. These examples are a reminder that providing innovative financial services comes with responsibilities to ensure that risks are appropriately controlled. Durably supporting financial inclusion means ensuring that necessary controls grow in step.\nUse of Alternative Data\nWe do see great promise to improve financial access when innovation is done with the appropriate risk controls in place. One such promising avenue is the use of alternative data in credit decisions involving small-dollar loans. Historically, access to the financial system was limited for many households and small businesses that lacked key financial credentials. For example, traditional credit models favor an applicant that already has a sufficient credit history and a file from a credit reporting bureau to qualify for lending. This leads to a catch-22 where lower-income applicants with scant credit history but ample ability to repay are denied access to credit because they do not have a credit history.\n2\nAs a result, many lower-income households, both banked and unbanked, end up using a range of formal and informal services outside the banking system that too often keep households in a cycle of debt.\n3\nActions by the Federal Reserve have supported the opportunities, as well as identified potential risks, associated with innovations in bank products and practices marketed to those who have limited access to the financial system. In 2019, the Federal Reserve's alternative data statement highlighted the benefits and risks when banks and nonbank firms leverage alternative data in credit underwriting, particularly for borrowers that have been locked out of conventional borrowing.\n4\nThis guidance underscored the potential benefit of using data that has a clear connection to creditworthiness, such as information on inflows and outflows from a bank customer's deposit account. With the share of households with bank accounts much larger than the share with credit scores and especially with prime or near-prime credit scores, this information has the potential to allow underwriting of a much larger pool of potential reliable borrowers. In addition, in 2020, the Federal Reserve issued principles for responsible small-dollar lending, typically uncollateralized loans of less than $2,000 that often leverage alternative data while being underwritten.\n5\nThis guidance has encouraged the spread of these types of loans to households and small businesses that otherwise have had limited access to credit.\n6\nIn addition, given the small but growing number of banks partnering with fintechs for alternative data and small-dollar lending, among other things, the Federal Reserve issued guidance in 2023 and 2024 on how to responsibly manage these third-party relationships.\n7\nTaken together, these statements are helpful resources to ensure that banks are using the technological innovations from these third parties in safe and responsible ways.\nAs noted in the alternative data guidance, alternative data can be sourced from a bank's own relationship with its customers. And evidence from research and industry experimentation suggests that information on cash flow from an individual's bank account can help predict credit risk while expanding credit access.\n8\nWe are already seeing progress in this space. Banks and credit unions of all sizes are starting to use alternative data to offer small-dollar loans to their existing customers with short-term liquidity needs. Given the early promise of these loans, this area seems particularly suitable for banks to innovate and experiment safely and fairly, within the confines of safety and soundness standards and consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, banks and others have done extensive work over the past few years to measure the impact of bank products on the financial outcomes of customers. Among those metrics are a set of financial health indicators around a customer's cash flow and payment history that capture their ability to meet their own short-term liquidity needs, build financial capacity, and affordably access financial services over time.\n9\nSuch indicators can help banks better understand the impact of their products and services on their customers, so that they support their customers' longer-term financial resilience. These indicators can also equip customers with the transparency and tools to assess financial service offerings.\nPotential of Instant Payments\nI'd also like to highlight the potential for real-time payment systems\u00e2\u0080\u0094including FedNow\n\u00ae\nand private sector systems\u00e2\u0080\u0094to advance financial inclusion. These services will enable banks to offer customers the ability to send and receive money immediately, which can help customers weather income disruption and unexpected expenses. By reducing payment delays and the high costs for consumers associated with those delays, FedNow can over time improve access to the financial system and lower costs.\nIncreased Access to Consumer Data\nI'm also interested to see how increased access to consumer-authorized data will change the landscape for innovation. As the rules, regulations, and practices related to expanded access and sharing of customer-permissioned data flows evolve, consumers may benefit from having a fuller picture of their financial life to better understand ways to improve their financial health. Customer-permissioned data access, alongside innovations in digital identity, also has the potential to allow banks to better assess a borrower's creditworthiness, increase customer access to financial services, offer customized and innovative financial products, and empower individuals to move more freely in the emerging digital financial system. Of course, bank adoption will play a key role in unlocking the power of such innovation. As with most innovations, regulators will need to ensure appropriate measures are in place to protect consumers and promote financial stability. For example, regulators will need to be diligent so that the entities to which consumers grant access to their data safeguard privacy and data security.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act: Past, Present, and Future\nLet me turn now to the importance of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and its role in advancing financial inclusion. As we know well, access to financial services and credit is fundamental to economic security and vital to strong communities. This access is the foundation of homeownership, education, small business development, and other economic activities that improve our lives and neighborhoods. I want to relate these values to the CRA and the Federal Reserve's commitment to encourage access to credit in low- and moderate-income communities.\nCongress enacted the CRA in 1977 as one of a set of laws, together with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, to address redlining, other forms of racial discrimination, and lack of access to credit in low- and moderate-income communities. Fair lending laws set the unequivocal standard that there is no place for such discrimination in the financial system. Federal banking agencies reinforce this standard by taking a bank's fair lending record into account when assigning a CRA rating and evaluating whether banks meet the credit needs in low- and moderate-income communities, consistent with safe and sound lending.\nThrough the enactment of the CRA, Congress charged the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators with the responsibility of assessing the performance of banks in meeting the credit needs of low- and moderate-income communities. Throughout the CRA's nearly 50 years of supervisory history, the agencies have strived to provide guidance that reflected dynamic changes in the financial landscape and at some points in time revise the regulations to do so.\nLast October, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to strengthen and modernize the regulations implementing the CRA.\n10\nPrior to the issuance of the final rule, the regulations had not been significantly updated since 1995. Throughout the rulemaking process, bankers and community groups consistently emphasized the need for greater clarity, consistency, and transparency than was provided under the existing rules and guidance.\nIn response, much of the detail in the final rule is designed to provide the desired additional clarity. The final rule standardizes the evaluation approach so that it is more consistent across the agencies and more transparent to banks and the public. It does this in a way that builds on how CRA examinations are conducted today.\nThe final rule includes several provisions intended to advance financial inclusion. For example, it emphasizes the work that minority depository institutions (MDIs) and community development financial institutions do to expand access to credit and opportunity in underserved communities. It also includes a focus on activities that serve Native Land Areas, persistent poverty areas, and other high-need areas.\nWe take our supervisory responsibilities under the CRA seriously, knowing that it helps to foster real opportunity for consumers and communities. The CRA has served as a critical tool to support financial inclusion across the country since its passage and will remain a vital tool for bankers and community organizations to work together to promote financial inclusion and economic development in low- and moderate-income communities.\nThe Future of Financial Inclusion\nGiven the importance of innovation to the goal of financial inclusion, I am grateful that we have been able to gather so many experts on topics related to it.\nWhile we have made considerable progress, we need to continue our efforts to support greater inclusion and a financial system that meets the needs of all Americans. At the Federal Reserve, we will continue to work to improve our understanding of the innovations in financial inclusion, and the intersection of payments innovation and financial inclusion, among others. We also will use our position to monitor innovations that have financial inclusion implications\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as alternative data use and financial health measurement\u00e2\u0080\u0094and keep the public informed on the evolving industry practices that help meet the needs of the financially underserved. For example, we expect to provide additional resources on alternative data use in the coming months. In addition, the Fed's Partnership for Progress program helps MDIs and women's depository institutions (WDIs) navigate their unique business challenges, provides MDIs and WDIs with resources for technical assistance, and conducts research on the unique challenges faced by low- and moderate-income communities.\n11\nWe also actively partner with Native Ame",

Bowman\nAt the Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington Bankers Associations 2024 Annual Convention, Stevenson, Washington\nShare\nI would like to thank the Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington Bankers Associations for the invitation to join you this morning.\n1\nIt's a pleasure to be here in Washington State to speak with your members. Direct interactions like this, outside of Washington, D.C., enable me to develop a deeper understanding of what is happening in the banking industry and the regional economy. Before sharing some thoughts about the current trajectory of regulatory approvals and bank merger policy, I will discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy.\nUpdate on the Economy and Monetary Policy Outlook\nOver the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our meeting earlier this month, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5\u00e2\u0080\u00911/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.\nAfter seeing considerable progress on slowing inflation last year, we have seen only modest further progress this year. The 12-month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures inflation have moved roughly sideways or slightly down since December and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in April. The consumer price index (CPI) report for May showed 12-month core CPI inflation slowing to 3.4 percent from 3.6 percent in April. However, with average core CPI inflation this year through May running at an annualized rate of 3.8 percent, notably above average inflation in the second half of last year, I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time.\nThe recent pickup in inflation in the first several months of 2024 was evident across many goods and services categories, suggesting that inflation was temporarily lower in the latter half of last year. Prices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which is weighing on consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation throughout this episode.\nEconomic activity increased at a strong pace last year but appears to have moderated early this year. First-quarter gross domestic product growth was slower than in the second half of last year, though private domestic final purchases continued to rise at a solid pace. Continued softness in consumer spending and weaker housing activity early in the second quarter also suggest less momentum in economic activity so far this year.\nPayroll employment continued to rise at a solid pace in April and May, though slightly slower than in the first quarter, partly reflecting increased immigrant labor supply. Despite some further rebalancing between supply and demand, the labor market remains tight. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.0 percent in May, while the number of job openings relative to unemployed workers declined further to near its pre-pandemic level. Labor force participation dropped back to 62.5 percent in May, which suggests no further improvement in labor supply along this margin, as labor force participation among those aged 55 or older has been persistently low.\nAt its current setting, our monetary policy stance appears to be restrictive, and I will continue to monitor the incoming data to assess whether monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our target. As I've noted recently, my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady. And should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate, and I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation.\nFirst, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in part to immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unlikely that further improvements along this margin will continue to lower inflation going forward, as supply chains have largely normalized, the labor force participation rate has leveled off in recent months below pre-pandemic levels, and an open U.S. immigration policy over the past few years, which added millions of new immigrants in the U.S., may become more restrictive.\nGeopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains, putting additional upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices. There is also the risk that the loosening in financial conditions since late last year, reflecting considerable gains in equity valuations, and additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate.\nFinally, there is a risk that increased immigration and continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation. Given the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize. With labor markets remaining tight, wage growth has been elevated at around or above 4 percent, still higher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal given trend productivity growth.\nIn light of these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the current state of the economy and predicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC's monetary policy decisions may evolve. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.\nRegulatory Approvals in the Banking System\nBefore turning directly to regulatory approvals in the banking system and merger and acquisition policy, it is important to consider these issues in the broader context. Regulatory approvals and bank mergers and acquisitions do not occur in a vacuum. The choices that regulators make on regulatory and supervisory policy issues have profound implications for mergers and acquisitions and for the appetite of bank management to engage in those transactions. In recent months, the banking agencies have issued or finalized a large number of regulatory changes. These changes are shaping the future of the banking system. From bank capital requirements to liquidity reform, significant revisions to the Community Reinvestment Act, a regulatory attack on banks charging fees for services (including debit card interchange fees), the trend of dialing supervision up to \"11\" for banks of all sizes, and the ongoing erosion of tailoring all shape the contours of the banking system, including bank size, the activities in which they engage, and where activities occur within the broader financial system.\n2\nThese policy decisions also create incentives and impacts that we must acknowledge and understand. When policymakers flatten and standardize regulations and supervisory expectations, we create strong incentives for banks to achieve greater economies of scale through merger and make it harder for new banks to successfully compete with existing banks.\nActually implementing clear merger standards would reduce the number of necessary application denials and withdrawals. Where clear standards exist, those seeking regulatory approval will only file for approval of those transactions that will meet the banking agency standards. In my mind, this would be responsible and effective public policy.\nDe Novo Bank Formation\nI continue to be concerned about the decline in the number of banks in the U.S. As I have noted in the past, there are several indications that there is an unmet demand for new bank creation demonstrated by the ongoing preference for \"charter strip\" acquisitions, the ongoing shift of activities out of the banking system, and the rising demand for banking-as-a-service partnerships.\n3\nFor the past decade, de novo bank formation has been largely stagnant, even as the banking industry has rapidly evolved over the same time. Many factors influence the pursuit of de novo bank charters, including the interest rate environment, business opportunities, the intense competition for qualified bank management and staff, and potentially less onerous alternatives for financial services to be provided outside of the regulated banking system.\nThe decision to form a de novo bank is also informed by normal business considerations, including identifying investors, establishing a viable business plan, and ensuring the ability to navigate the \"start-up\" phase of a new bank and manage upfront operational costs, all while being subjected to intense supervisory oversight over the first several years of operation. Yet perhaps the most important factor that influences de novo bank formation is the regulatory and supervisory framework. This includes the application process and receipt of regulatory approval.\nThis application process can be a significant obstacle to de novo bank formation. Applications often experience significant delays between the initial charter application filing with the chartering authority and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation application for deposit insurance. It often takes well in excess of a year to receive all of the required regulatory approvals to open for business. Of course, this uncertainty remains after the initial capital has been raised, shareholders identified, and a management team is ready to begin work. These delays present unique challenges for de novo founders, including incurrence of more start-up expenses, difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified management to obtain approval, and challenges in raising additional start-up capital investment.\nIn my view, the absence of de novo bank formation over the long run will create a void in the banking system, a void that could contribute to a decline in the availability of reliable and fairly priced credit, the absence of financial services in underserved markets, and the continued shift of banking activities outside the banking system.\nBank Mergers and Acquisitions\nAnother pressing area of concern is the rapidly shifting approach to bank mergers and acquisitions (M&A) by some prudential regulators.\n4\nM&A transactions allow banks to evolve and thrive in our dynamic banking system and can promote the long-term health and viability of banks. M&A also ensures that banks have a meaningful path to transitioning bank ownership. The absence of a viable M&A framework increases the potential for additional risks, including limited opportunities for succession planning, especially in smaller or rural communities, and zombie banks that continue to exist but have no competitive viability or exit strategy.\nThe impact of a more restrictive M&A framework affects institutions of all sizes, including larger institutions that are vying to compete with the very largest global systemically important banks. They may choose to pursue M&A to remain competitive with larger peers who can achieve growth organically through sheer scale.\nM&A is an important part of a healthy banking system. So when considering changes to the framework, I think we need to first identify the problem that needs to be solved and then ask whether any proposed solution is fair, transparent, and consistent with applicable statutes\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, critically, whether the proposed solution has the potential to damage the long-term viability of the banking system.\nAre there identified shortcomings in the current process or standards, and are the proposed reforms targeted and effective to address these shortcomings? One argument I have heard about the M&A regulatory approval process is that the lack of application\ndenials\ndemonstrates that regulators are failing to meaningfully review and pressure-test proposals and have effectively become a rubber stamp. I think this argument lacks a strong foundation. There is ample evidence that undermines this argument, including the resource demands on institutions pursuing M&A activity and the extended time it takes to complete the regulatory review and approval process (and the not insignificant failure rate we see represented in withdrawn applications).\nWe also have to acknowledge that choosing the path of a merger or acquisition is not undertaken lightly. These transactions require significant upfront and ongoing investment and commitment of resources. At the outset, this includes finding an appropriate acquisition target, conducting due diligence, and negotiating the terms of the transaction. Once a target is identified, the banks must prepare appropriate regulatory filings, engage with regulators during the application process, and prepare for post-approval business processes, including scheduling necessary and costly systems conversions and customer transition. This is an expensive and reputationally risky process that bankers and their boards of directors take extremely seriously.\nOne would also expect to see different patterns emerging if regulators were truly acting as a rubber stamp for banking applications. We know from data published by the Federal Reserve that filing an application does not guarantee approval, even in the absence of a regulatory denial. The Federal Reserve's most recent report on banking applications activity identifies a significant portion of bank M&A transactions in which applications have been withdrawn.\n5\nThe processing timelines we se",

Bowman\nAt the ISDA Board of Directors, London, England\nShare\nI would like to thank the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) for the invitation to speak to you today.\n1\nI appreciate the opportunity to engage with you on matters that affect the swaps and derivatives industry, specifically how we can best consider and address the potential consequences of bank capital reform measures, both in the United States and around the world. Before doing so, I will share my views on the economy and monetary policy in the United States.\nUpdate on the Economy and Monetary Policy Outlook\nOver the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our meeting earlier this month, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.\nAfter seeing considerable progress on slowing inflation last year, we have seen only modest further progress this year. The 12-month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation have moved roughly sideways or slightly down since December and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in April. The consumer price index (CPI) report for May showed 12-month core CPI inflation slowing to 3.4 percent from 3.6 percent in April. However, with average core CPI inflation this year through May running at an annualized rate of 3.8 percent, notably above average inflation in the second half of last year, I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time.\nThe recent pickup in inflation in the first several months of 2024 was evident across many goods and services categories, suggesting that inflation was temporarily lower in the latter half of last year. Prices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which is weighing on consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation throughout this episode.\nEconomic activity increased at a strong pace last year but appears to have moderated early this year. First-quarter gross domestic product growth was slower than in the second half of last year, though private domestic final purchases continued to rise at a solid pace. Continued softness in consumer spending and weaker housing activity early in the second quarter also suggest less momentum in economic activity so far this year.\nPayroll employment continued to rise at a solid pace in April and May, though slightly slower than in the first quarter, partly reflecting increased immigrant labor supply. Despite some further rebalancing between supply and demand, the labor market remains tight. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.0 percent in May, while the number of job openings relative to unemployed workers declined further to near its pre-pandemic level. Labor force participation dropped back to 62.5 percent in May, which suggests no further improvement in labor supply along this margin, as labor force participation among those aged 55 and older has been persistently low.\nAt its current setting, our monetary policy stance appears to be restrictive, and I will continue to monitor the incoming data to assess whether monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our target. As I've noted recently, my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady. And should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the target range for the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate, and I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation.\nFirst, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in part to immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unlikely that further improvements along this margin will continue to lower inflation going forward as supply chains have largely normalized; the labor force participation rate has leveled off in recent months below pre-pandemic levels; and an open U.S. immigration policy over the past few years, which added millions of new immigrants in the U.S., may become more restrictive.\nGeopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains, putting additional upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices. There is also the risk that the loosening in financial conditions since late last year, reflecting considerable gains in equity valuations, and additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate.\nFinally, there is a risk that increased immigration and continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation. Given the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize. With labor markets remaining tight, wage growth has been elevated at around or above 4 percent, still higher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal, given trend productivity growth.\nIn light of these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the current state of the economy and predicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC's monetary policy decisions may evolve. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.\nGrappling with the Unintended Consequences of Bank Capital Reform\nI will turn now to the issue of bank capital reform, and the implications of adopting and implementing the Basel III \"endgame\" standards both in the United States and around the world.\nConsidering capital and debt requirements in the aggregate\nCapital requirements are an important component of the prudential regulatory frameworks and interconnected banking and financial systems around the world. As you know, the U.S. has lagged our E.U. and U.K. counterparts in fully implementing the Basel III capital standards. In July 2023, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued a public consultation on implementing what the U.S. calls the Basel III \"endgame\" capital reforms.\n2\nThe response to the U.S. capital proposal has been overwhelmingly negative, including from a broad range of stakeholders. I have previously spoken at length about my concerns with the proposal, and as public commenters have reviewed it, they have identified additional areas of concern.\n3\nIn my view, the concerns are well-founded. The proposal acknowledged that the revisions, if implemented, would result in an estimated 20 percent aggregate increase in total risk-weighted assets across bank holding companies subject to the rule. Individual impacts would vary not only by firm, but also by business line. For any particular business line or product, the aggregate impact of the proposed capital changes could result in a more significant increase, depending upon the firm's characteristics. Consider the impact on business lines subject to the market risk capital rule. As noted in the proposal, the revisions to the market risk rule alone would increase risk-weighted assets from $430 billion to $760 billion for Category I and II firms, and from $130 billion to $220 billion for Category III and IV firms.\n4\nEven this example ignores the additive capital increases from other aspects of the rule, such as the operational risk charge \"overlay\" that may separately result in a higher capital charge for the same business line, if that line is also generating fee income. The changes that may affect any particular financial product or service vary but could include impacts across all aspects of the proposal. For many of the derivatives and swaps activities in which banking entities engage, the aggregate impacts on different business lines could result from changes to the market risk rule, the calculation of credit valuation adjustments, and the treatment of securities financing transactions, among others.\nSo far, what I have described are just the aggregate effects of capital increases that would appear within the four corners of the U.S. Basel III endgame proposal. We know that these changes do not exist in a vacuum. A particular firm can also be impacted by changes to the global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge and long-term debt requirements. The firm's business planning would also need to consider existing requirements, such as leverage and \"total loss-absorbing capacity\" requirements. By design, these elements are intended to be complementary, often seeking to capture different risks, operate as \"backstop\" capital standards, promote resiliency, and be available for recapitalization in resolution.\nDespite the goal that the capital framework operates in a holistic fashion, the rulemaking process in the United States has taken a fragmented approach. This process has seemed to ignore the interrelationships of the requirements. We cannot fully understand the intended and unintended consequences of any regulatory reform, including capital reform, without using a broader lens to consider the interconnections and interrelationships among different capital and debt requirements that apply in the banking system.\nThis narrow approach to rulemaking\u00e2\u0080\u0094focusing on a specific reform, without considering the broader framework\u00e2\u0080\u0094has created a corresponding narrowness when we think about the consequences of regulatory reform. This challenge has been particularly acute in the capital and debt space simply because there are so many requirements that are intended to operate in a complementary way, and that in the aggregate may overlap or conflict, generating unintended consequences. The Federal Reserve has expressly acknowledged the complementary nature of these requirements, for example in noting that some leverage ratio requirements operate as a backstop to risk-based capital requirements.\n5\nAnd yet, the discussions of costs and benefits of reform tend to disregard the aggregate impact across rules, even when related reforms are proposed at the same time and the aggregate impacts can be identified and assessed.\n6\nConsidering direct and indirect consequences\nWith respect to the Basel III \"endgame\" reforms, much of the discussion of consequences has focused on the direct consequences to the availability and price of credit, resulting from the proposed changes to risk-weighted assets. These issues resonate with households and businesses. Everyone understands the direct impact on their own household finances or their business's bottom line from higher costs of lending. Often overlooked are the direct and indirect consequences of capital reforms on financial products such as derivatives and swaps. These products can seem exotic to the public, but we know they play a significant role in the financial system and the broader economy, including commodities price hedging by end-users, such as agricultural producers. And it is certainly foreseeable that proposed capital reforms could impair market liquidity.\nWe also know that regulatory reforms\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially capital reforms with a direct link to particular products, services, and markets\u00e2\u0080\u0094can cause broader changes in firm behavior. Some banks may raise prices on particular products based on their internal allocation of increased capital charges. And some banks may discontinue certain products or services that cannot be offered in a cost-effective way. These choices will impact the competitive landscape into the future, and in some cases\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as where significant economies of scale are required to offer a product or service\u00e2\u0080\u0094the end result may be that some banks exit certain product markets, resulting in increased concentration and higher prices for households and businesses.\nWhile I am acutely aware of our need to consider these costs and price effects, I am also aware that regulators sitting in Washington, D.C. are not well-equipped to query and understand these real-world consequences of reform. In my view, the commenter feedback we have received on these issues has helped to illuminate these consequences. My hope is that we take them into account when moving forward to implement the Basel III endgame standards.\nThe path forward\nI do see a path forward to implement Basel III, one that not only addresses the overall calibration and international consistency and comparability, but also makes more granular changes that will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the rule. In terms of this path, I will briefly outline what I see as necessary procedural steps, while also providing a non-exclusive list of substantive changes that I believe are necessary to improve the proposal.\nIn October 2023, the Federal Reserve initiated a data collection to gather information from the banks affected by the U.S. proposal. I am hopeful that these data will allow regulators to better understand the proposal's impact and identify areas for revision. Any next step in this rulemaking process will require broad and material changes. It should also be accompanied by a data-driven analysis of the proposal and be informed by the significant public input received during the rulemaking process. This should assist policymakers in creating a path to improve the rulemaking. My hope is that policymakers pay closer attention to the balance of co",

It is an honor to be a part of this workshop again and to kickoff this year's event.\nCybersecurity continues to be a key risk area for the banking industry and for regulators. Cyber-related events, including ransomware attacks and business email compromises, are extremely costly and time-consuming experiences. For community banks, maintaining the necessary resources and technology to support a successful cybersecurity program can feel especially challenging and financially burdensome. The evolving nature of cyberthreats requires banks to continually review and enhance processes and procedures to protect, detect, and respond to an incident, even if the operating environment has not significantly changed. Ten years ago, immutable backups and multifactor authentication on privileged access accounts were not common controls deployed by community banks. Today, they are considered to be standard elements of a cyber risk management strategy.\nFinancial industry vendors and service providers add an additional layer of cyber-related vulnerability. Attacks on these third parties have enabled bad actors to create operational incidents and breaches of customer information at financial institutions. Effectively managing and monitoring third-party relationships is an essential component of a bank's broader risk management function. Given the increased adoption of cloud-based solutions, outsourcing of critical functions, and exploration of the use of artificial intelligence (AI), banks must have robust strategies for cyber resilience. Generative AI has the potential to transform operations and the customer experience. But it is also vulnerable to cyberthreats and will require an ongoing analysis of risk-identification and -management.\nLast year, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency jointly issued new guidance titled \"Interagency Guidance on Third-Party Relationships: Risk Management,\" which was recently supplemented by a community bank guide meant to assist these banks in tailoring their third-party risk management programs. Later this afternoon, you will hear more on this from our panel of IT examiners on these resources, recent observations from the field, and risks associated with AI.\nRansomware attacks continue to target individuals, businesses, and governments across the country and often result in significant financial and operational harm. Combating ransomware requires that an organization make investments in people, processes, and technology. Often, these attacks are successful because well-intentioned staff have their guard down, or they are not effectively trained to identify and respond to a potential incident.\nEmployees can be your greatest strength, but also your weakest link when it comes to protecting digital assets. That's why it is critical that cyberprograms are built upon a solid foundation that includes training staff to quickly respond to suspicious activity. This reinforces the importance of a skeptical approach in helping to safeguard information. Today and tomorrow, Federal Reserve staff, law enforcement, and industry stakeholders will share their perspectives on ransomware incidents, including restoration of key payments-related functions, cyberinsurance, payments-related risks, and financial considerations during an incident.\nFinally, a cybersecurity program would not be complete without a comprehensive testing and exercise plan. By incorporating regular testing, a bank can identify strengths and weaknesses in their current strategies. They can then leverage this information to enhance resiliency, resulting in a higher level of preparedness when an incident occurs. Tabletop exercises like the one facilitated tomorrow with IBM are an excellent way to test a cyberdefense strategy against multiple scenarios, including those involving a third party and payment systems.\nIn closing, outreach events like this workshop, the February 2024 Ask the Fed\u00ae session with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and our recent virtual \"office hours\" on the 2023 third-party risk management guidance enable us to connect and share resources. These opportunities help us to better support industry management of cybersecurity and other operational risks.\nI would like to thank the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis for organizing this event, and I hope you enjoy the workshop.\n1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\nReturn to text\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            June 25, 2024",

Cook\nAt the Economic Club of New York, New York, New York\nShare\nThank you, Barbara. It is a fitting time to be speaking again to the Economic Club of New York, because this month marks two years since my first Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.\n1\nAt that meeting, we kicked off a series of large interest-rate increases, all of which I supported, because I am fully committed to bringing inflation sustainably back to our 2 percent target. As I said when I joined the Board, I care about both sides of the dual mandate Congress gives us, maximum employment and price stability. When inflation was well above target and the unemployment rate was historically low, we prioritized restoring price stability. Over the past year, inflation has slowed, and labor market tightness has eased, such that the risks to achieving our inflation and employment goals have moved toward better balance.\nI think now is a good time to assess how the economy has evolved after rates have held steady at a restrictive level for nearly a year. Today, I will provide a progress report on disinflation, give you my outlook on the economy, and share my views on how to ensure that monetary policy brings inflation fully back to 2 percent over time while being attentive to the risk of a slowing labor market. I will conclude my remarks with a few words about my role as chair of the Board's Financial Stability Committee.\nInflation\nAs the U.S. and global economy recovered from the pandemic, rebounding demand came up against still-constrained supply, and inflation rose to the highest level in many years. In the past two years, 12-month inflation in the PCE price index has fallen from a peak above 7 percent to 2.7 percent in April, and it likely moved a bit lower in May based on consumer and producer price data. However, after rapid disinflation in the second half of last year, progress has slowed this year. My focus remains on making sure inflation is on a path to return sustainably to 2 percent. How do I think about making that determination? To respond, I think it is helpful to look at the underlying data.\nSome price components have clearly improved. Food and energy price increases moderated significantly over the past two years as global commodity supplies recovered from the shock of Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. When excluding often-volatile food and energy costs, 12-month inflation in core goods prices is down from 7.6 percent in early 2022, returning to the trend of slightly negative inflation observed before the pandemic. The increased availability of computer chips and other material inputs led to a recovery in motor vehicle production and, along with restraint in aggregate demand, likely reduced supply\u00e2\u0080\u0093demand imbalances for durable goods, more generally.\nInflation in services, a spending category that accounts for about two-thirds of household budgets, has slowed significantly, though it remains noticeably above pre-pandemic rates. Specifically, housing services inflation has eased quite gradually, as it takes time for the moderation of increases in market rent\u00e2\u0080\u0094what a landlord charges a new tenant\u00e2\u0080\u0094to show through to broader measures of shelter costs. One possible explanation is that landlords raise rents for existing tenants only gradually over several years and are still moving those rents closer to the market rate.\nOutside of housing, 12-month services inflation slowed over the course of last year from above 5 percent to below 3.5 percent but has stalled near that rate this year. That is still about 1 percentage point above the average pace during the two years before the pandemic. Some of the largest contributors to recent services inflation are imputed prices, including portfolio management fees that are affected by equity price increases. Other components of services inflation that are more reflective of supply and demand conditions in the economy have continued to ease. Prices of hotel stays, airline tickets, and restaurant meals are illustrative.\nI expect that the longer-run disinflation trend will continue as interest rates weigh on demand. Anecdotal reports, including from the Fed's Beige Book, suggest consumers are pushing back on price increases. Several national retailers have announced plans to lower prices on certain items, and there is increasing evidence that higher-income shoppers are trading down to discount stores. Two other important factors supporting this trend are well-anchored long-term inflation expectations and short-term inflation expectations falling back to near pre-pandemic levels.\nMy forecast is that three- and six-month inflation rates will continue to move lower on a bumpy path, as consumers' resistance to price increases is reflected in the inflation data. I expect 12-month inflation will roughly move sideways for the rest of this year, with monthly data likely similar to the favorable readings during the second half of last year. Beyond that, I see inflation slowing more sharply next year, with housing-services inflation declining to reflect the past slowing in rents on new leases, core goods inflation remaining slightly negative, and inflation in core services excluding housing easing over time.\nLabor Market\nTurning to the other side of our dual mandate, the labor market has largely returned to a better alignment between supply and demand. Many indicators suggest the job market is roughly where it was before the pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u0094tight but not overheated. The unemployment rate was a still-low 4 percent in May, but it has gradually risen over the past year since touching a more than half-century low of 3.4 percent in April 2023. Last month's rate was also modestly above readings just before the pandemic took hold.\nLayoffs remain low, and payroll growth has been solid so far this year, adding an average of 248,000 jobs a month, essentially matching last year's pace. Labor supply has expanded, partly reflecting a rise in immigration. Labor force participation has broadly rebounded from pandemic lows, except for those aged 65 or older. Women between the ages of 25 and 54 led the rebound, with their participation reaching 78.1 percent in May, the highest ever recorded. With more workers entering the economy, the monthly job gains needed to keep the unemployment rate steady likely has risen from just under 100,000 to nearly 200,000. Although these estimates are uncertain, such a breakeven pace may be a bit higher than the true pace of recent job gains, when taking into account data from the Quarterly Census for Employment and Wages. These data suggest that payroll job gains were overstated last year and may continue to be so this year. Thus, even the robust payroll numbers are consistent with a tight, but not overheating, labor market.\nSigns of better balance in the labor market have come into focus. For example, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment has fallen from a high of 2.0 in mid-2022 to 1.2 in April, in line with its pre-pandemic level. Workers are also less likely to leave their current jobs in search of new ones. The quits rate has fallen from 3.0 percent in April 2022 to 2.2 percent this April and is now below its 2019 average. This decline suggests a normalization following a period of high churn. Wage growth is outpacing inflation but is also moderating. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta show that the wage-growth differential between job changers and stayers has narrowed. Wage growth reflected in postings from online job boards, such as Indeed, has returned to pre-pandemic levels. These measures tend to adjust quickly to changes in labor market conditions.\nEconomic Activity\nTurning to the broader picture, the U.S. economy has rebounded robustly since the short but deep pandemic recession. Overall, gross domestic product (GDP) growth eased in the first quarter from the rate at the end of last year. However, much of the first-quarter weakness was in net exports and inventories, noisy components from which I do not take much signal, while growth in private domestic final purchases remained solid. Going forward, I expect economic growth to remain near the rate of potential growth, somewhat above 2 percent, which is boosted by the increase in the size of the labor force.\nAmerican consumers have driven the current expansion, bolstered by strong income growth. But recent data, including first-quarter household spending and retail sales for April and May, suggest that growth is slowing. And, in April, the total amount of credit-card balances and other types of revolving consumer debt declined for the first time since 2021. Signs of strain continue to emerge among consumers with low-to-moderate incomes, as their liquid savings and access to credit have increasingly become exhausted. Credit-card delinquency is\non an upward trend, and the\nrate at which auto loans are transitioning into delinquency is at a 13-year high. These rates are not yet concerning for the overall economy but bear watching.\nOffsetting some of the slowing in consumer spending, investment spending for equipment and intangibles, such as intellectual property and software, has been strong this year. After growing at about only a 1 percent pace last year, equipment and intangibles spending grew at a more than 4 percent annual rate in the first quarter. If that strength continues, it has the potential to increase productivity over time.\nProductivity growth is one factor that could change the path of both the expansion and inflation. Last year's GDP growth of 3.1 percent came alongside more moderate employment gains, implying strong growth in productivity. The economy may have benefited from investment undertaken in response to strong demand when the labor market was tight. Productivity growth is volatile and difficult to measure, but if it remains strong, then a faster pace of economic growth might not be inflationary. While the pace of gains may have cooled from last year, I still lean toward optimism on innovation and productivity. Looking ahead, I see adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technology as a potentially significant source of productivity growth, keeping in mind that breakthroughs, such as effective generative AI, will take time to fully reach their potential and disseminate throughout the economy and for complementary investment to bear fruit.\nMonetary Policy\nConsidering the full view of economic data available at the time, my colleagues on the FOMC and I decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent when we met earlier this month. I believe our current monetary policy stance is restrictive, putting downward pressure on aggregate demand in the economy. With disinflation continuing, albeit at a slower pace this year, and the labor market having largely normalized, I see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as having moved toward better balance. Given our data dependence, we will closely monitor incoming information to determine the future path of policy.\nReturning inflation sustainably to our 2 percent target is an ongoing process and not a fait accompli. In considering how restrictive policy is, I look at a broad range of indicators from financial and credit markets. For instance, the two-year real rate, derived from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, remains around 2.7 percent, up from an average of about 1/2 percent in the couple of years before the pandemic, while the 30-year mortgage rate is around 7 percent. Meanwhile, banks have significantly tightened credit standards over the past two years. In particular, small businesses and some small banks and community development financial institutions are experiencing diminished access to credit. Many of these businesses also face short-duration loans that need to be refinanced at higher interest rates. With rising delinquencies, a number of low-to-moderate-income households are also likely experiencing diminished access to credit. On the other hand, the largest firms and the largest banks do not report a lack of access to funding. Larger firms, like many homeowners, were able to lock in low interest rates for longer terms a few years ago, before rates rose.\nOf course, the economic outlook is always uncertain. One way to address such uncertainty is to consider a range of scenarios and not just the baseline forecast. One scenario is the possibility that persistently high inflation durably increases inflation expectations. While this appears less likely than a year or two ago, I am very attentive to the evolution of inflation expectations. Such a risk would imply keeping monetary policy restrictive for longer. Another scenario would be that the economy and labor market weaken more sharply than expected in my baseline forecast. In that case, monetary policy would need to respond to such a threat to the employment side of the dual mandate.\nConsidering the balance of risks related to these scenarios, I believe that our current policy is well positioned to respond as needed to any changes in the economic outlook. With significant progress on inflation and the labor market cooling gradually, at some point it will be appropriate to reduce the level of policy restriction to maintain a healthy balance in the economy. The timing of any such adjustment will depend on how economic data evolve and what they imply for the economic outlook and balance of risks.\nFinancial Stability\nBefore I conclude, I would like to say a few words about the financial system's resilience. Following the 2007\u00e2\u0080\u009309 financial crisis, a broad set of reforms was put in place to bolster financial stability. To ensure an ongoing focus on that area, the Board established its Committee on Financial Stability as a venue to discuss related developments and policy issues. Earlier this year, I became the chair of this committee.\nConsistent with some easing of financial conditions since late last year, valuations for some asset categories have risen. Home prices, for example, have outstripped rent gains for several years. That leaves measures such as the price-to-rent ratio high relative to historical averages. Yet, these valuations have not led to an appreciable increase in risk-taking. While house prices have been growing rapidly, mortgage debt has not, and most households have ample equity cushions. As I said earlier, some households are experiencing financial strain, and rising delinquency rates suggest some caution. Borrowing by businesses and households has been expanding at rates below GDP growth for several years. I use the ratios of their debt levels to GDP as a rough proxy of whether the sectors are overleveraged, and those stand well below pre-pandemic le",

Bowman\nAt Policy Exchange, London, England\nShare\nWatch Live\nI would like to thank Policy Exchange for the invitation to speak with you today.\n1\nEngagement abroad is essential for gaining a better understanding of the common forces shaping the global economy and financial system. It also promotes a better understanding of the drivers of differences between the economic and financial environments across countries and jurisdictions. My remarks will offer some perspectives on recent developments in monetary policy and bank regulatory policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094specifically, bank capital reform\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the U.S. These are two areas in which I am actively engaged as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\nMonetary Policy\nI'll begin with monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\u00e2\u0080\u0094the monetary policymaking body of the Federal Reserve System\u00e2\u0080\u0094has been keenly focused on restoring price stability following the surge in inflation during 2021 and in 2022 in the aftermath of the global COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, inflation reached levels not seen in the U.S. since the 1970s and 1980s. The high inflation experienced in the U.S. in the wake of the pandemic was also experienced in many economies around the world, reflecting, in part, the common global nature of the shocks that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn many economies during the pandemic, supply constraints related to social-distancing measures, reduced labor supply, and supply chain disruptions, coupled with strong demand for goods as economies emerged from pandemic restrictions, acted as catalysts, pushing inflation up to very high levels. Aggregate demand was also supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, which served to bolster the balance sheets of households, businesses, and local governments, and contributed to very tight labor markets.\nThe global inflation experience since the pandemic was highly synchronized across the major world economies, reflecting similar shocks that acted to reduce supply, while fiscal and monetary policy interventions stimulated demand. Early in the pandemic, many economic sectors, especially in services, were affected by lockdowns and both mandatory and voluntary social distancing. Many workers also transitioned to working remotely. Aggressive fiscal policies helped support personal and business income, and monetary policy became highly accommodative. The large shift in the composition of demand toward goods resulted in rising supply bottlenecks and higher goods prices.\nReduced immigration and lower labor force participation led to very tight labor markets as the economy reopened and demand recovered. Consumer spending was supported by excess savings accumulated from extraordinary fiscal support and reduced spending during lockdowns. Wage growth and services price inflation also picked up and have remained persistently elevated, reflecting a tight labor market and the protracted adjustment of prices and wages to the shocks during the pandemic.\nA sharp rise in food and energy price inflation, and their pass-through to core inflation, also contributed to a more synchronous inflation dynamic across major advanced foreign economies in recent years. Food and energy prices are mostly set in global markets, and their sharp increases also reflected the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, especially for major European economies including the U.K.\nMany central banks facing these dynamics tightened monetary policy in an effort to better balance demand and supply and to bring inflation back down to target. In the U.S., by late 2021, it became clear that the FOMC's monetary policy stance was too accommodative in the presence of growing inflationary pressures, due to broader and more persistent supply constraints, and that the Committee needed to move toward a tighter policy. It seems likely to me that the U.S. experience during the years leading up to the pandemic, when inflation was persistently low, made it hard for many to foresee how quickly that situation could change. Additionally, the domestic inflation and labor data did not accurately reflect the economic conditions prevailing at the time and were subsequently substantially revised.\n2\nIn my view, these factors, combined with new forward guidance introduced in the September and December 2020 FOMC statements following the revisions to the Committee's monetary policy strategy consensus statement in August 2020, contributed to a delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021.\n3\n,\n4\nIn late 2021, the FOMC did begin to move toward tightening the stance of monetary policy and, beginning in 2022, increased the policy rate rapidly to bring monetary policy into restrictive territory. Since March 2022, the FOMC has raised the target range of the federal funds rate by 5\u00e2\u0080\u00911/4 percentage points. The target range has remained at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent since July 2023. Since June 2022, the Federal Reserve has also been reducing its securities holdings, which had increased substantially during the pandemic period.\nThe tightening in monetary policy has had an effect. Over 2023, we saw significant progress on lowering inflation in the U.S. while the economy and labor market have remained strong. The 12-month change in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices slowed to 2.9 percent in December 2023, nearly 2 percentage points less than one year earlier. The restrictive stance of monetary policy reduced demand-side inflation pressures. Rising interest rates continued to act as a drag on growth of residential and business investment, outside of an increase in construction of new electric vehicle battery and microprocessor factories. Labor demand also moderated, contributing to some loosening of labor market tightness. The job openings and quits rates fell and payroll employment gains slowed significantly throughout last year.\n5\nSome of the progress on inflation last year also reflected favorable supply-side developments, including the resolution of supply chain disruptions and increased labor supply\u00e2\u0080\u0094both from higher immigration and higher labor force participation of prime-age workers\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as lower energy prices.\nSince the beginning of 2024, however, we have seen only modest further progress on inflation. The 12-month measures of total and core PCE inflation have moved roughly sideways or slightly down since December and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in April. The consumer price index (CPI) report for May showed 12-month core CPI inflation slowing to 3.4 percent from 3.6 percent in April. However, with average core CPI inflation this year through May running at an annualized rate of 3.8\u00e2\u0080\u00afpercent, notably above average inflation in the second half of last year, I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time.\nRecent data suggest some moderation in economic activity early this year. First-quarter gross domestic product growth was slower than in the second half of last year, though private domestic final purchases continued to rise at a solid pace. Continued softness in consumer spending and weaker housing activity early in the second quarter also suggest less momentum in economic activity so far this year.\nPayroll employment continued to rise at a solid pace in April and May, though slightly slower than in the first quarter, partly reflecting increased immigrant labor supply. Despite some further rebalancing between supply and demand, the labor market remains tight. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.0 percent in May, while the number of job openings relative to unemployed workers declined further to near its pre-pandemic level. Labor force participation dropped back to 62.5 percent in May, which suggests no further improvement in labor supply along this margin, as labor force participation among those aged 55 or older has been persistently low.\nIn contrast to the past two years, it is possible over the coming months that the path of monetary policy in the U.S. will diverge from that of other advanced economies, including the U.K., as the underlying economic developments and outlooks across jurisdictions exhibit greater heterogeneity. Inflation and labor market developments in the U.S. have unfolded differently in recent quarters compared to many other advanced economies, likely reflecting a more open immigration policy and significantly larger discretionary fiscal stimulus since the pandemic.\nEconomic activity in the U.S. has recovered considerably more than in other advanced foreign economies, including in the U.K. This likely reflects higher levels of fiscal support and productivity growth in the U.S. compared to other major economies.\n6\nA more flexible labor market in the U.S. likely allowed for greater movement of workers across sectors following the COVID-19 shock, with higher unemployment in the early stages of the pandemic followed by stronger job creation during the recovery.\nA rebound in new business formation in the U.S. also likely enhanced productivity growth in recent years. With economic activity remaining weaker in other advanced foreign economies than in the U.S. and given differing economic and inflation outlooks in their own jurisdictions, central banks in these economies may ease monetary policy sooner or more quickly than in the U.S.\nInflation in the U.S. remains elevated, and I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook. First, it is unlikely that further supply-side improvements will continue to lower inflation going forward, as supply chains have largely normalized, the labor force participation rate has leveled off in recent months below pre-pandemic levels, and an open U.S. immigration policy that added millions of new immigrants in the U.S. over the past few years may become more restrictive.\nGeopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains, putting additional upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices. There is also the risk that the loosening in financial conditions since last year, reflecting considerable gains in equity valuations, and additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate.\nFinally, there is a risk that increased immigration and continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation. Given the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize. With labor markets remaining tight, wage growth has been elevated at around or above 4 percent, still higher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal given trend productivity growth.\nIn the U.S., the FOMC pursues monetary policy in support of price stability and maximum employment. These goals mandated to the Federal Reserve by the U.S. Congress are focused on domestic economic conditions. However, international economic and financial developments can influence U.S. monetary policy to the extent that these developments affect the economic outlook for the U.S. For example, weaker foreign activity and an appreciation of the dollar driven by easier monetary policy abroad would both reduce foreign demand for U.S. exports and lower the outlook for economic growth in the U.S. Likewise, geopolitical developments or trade restrictions could affect the outlook for the prices of energy, food, and goods.\nLooking ahead, I will be closely watching the incoming data as I assess whether monetary policy in the U.S. is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal over time. The extent and frequency of revisions to U.S. economic data since the pandemic have made the task of assessing the current state of the economy and the outlook even more challenging. My baseline outlook continues to be that U.S. inflation will return to the FOMC's 2 percent goal, with the target range of the federal funds rate held at its current level of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for some time. Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive.\nHowever, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC's monetary policy decisions may evolve. I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse. Given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy. Reducing our policy rate too soon or too quickly could result in a rebound in inflation, requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2 percent over the longer run.\nBank Capital Reform\nI will now briefly touch on bank capital reforms, which are particularly important when it comes to our global and interconnected banking and financial systems. The U.S. has lagged its EU and U.K. counterparts in fully implementing the Basel III capital standards. In July 2023, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued a public consultation on implementing what we call the Basel III \"endgame\" capital reforms.\n7\nThe U.S. proposal was notable for a number of reasons, but I would highlight two in particular. First, the U.S. proposal would significantly expand the scope of application and calibration of these capital requirements. And, second, this proposal went beyond the Basel framework in several areas, undermining the goal of increasing consistency in capital standards across jurisdictions and potentially creating competitive concerns. The response to the U.S. capital proposal was overwhelmingly negative from a broad range of commenters.\nCalibration and scope\nA key consideration in evaluating reform efforts is whether the benefits of a change outweigh the costs, both for the financial institutions subject to these reforms and for the broader economy. The benefits of reform, like Basel III, are clear\u00e2\u0080\u0094on a basic level, higher capital can make the banking system safer. At a minimum, this increased safety comes at a cost; in its more extreme forms, it can actually increase financial stability risks.\nThe Basel III proposal in the U.S. is complex and, if it were to apply today as propos",

Waller\nAt the 2024 International Journal of Central Banking Conference, Rome, Italy\nShare\nThank you, Stefano, and thank you to the Central Bank of Italy (CBI) for hosting this year's conference.\nWhen it is in the news, central banking often looks like the work of individual policymakers handing down their decisions. In fact, it is a team effort of many people working together, and that is also the case for editing the\nInternational Journal of Central Banking\n(IJCB) and planning this conference. I have a long list of people to thank who did the lion's share of that work during the year that I have served as managing editor. But for those who may not know it, let me first review the history of the journal and then discuss what this conference will address.\nIn the summer of 2004, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the European Central Bank, and the Group of Ten central banks agreed to support the development of a new publication focused on the theory and practice of central banking. We didn't launch this journal because there was a shortage of research on central banking or of journals eager to publish it. Far from it. Central bankers themselves continue to publish peer-reviewed research in leading journals, not to mention many working papers published by central banks and other outlets. This work was prevalent, but there was a sense that there lacked a place for scholarly research that focused exclusively on central banking and could serve as a forum for the community of central bankers around the world. The creation of the International Journal of Central Banking filled this deficit.\nThe primary objectives of the IJCB are to widely disseminate the best policy-relevant and applied research on central banking and to promote communication among researchers inside and outside central banks. We do this with publication of the journal, which will now be coming out six times a year, and with the added attention of this conference, which presents research on timely policy topics. The journal has attracted distinguished managing editors, including my colleagues from the Federal Reserve and my immediate predecessor, Luc Laeven from the European Central Bank. We have the strong support now of nearly 55 sponsoring institutions, including the Central Bank of Italy and also the host of last year's conference, the Central Bank of Ireland.\nIn 2023, we chose the theme for this year's conference based on events very much on the minds of central bankers: \"The Transmission of Monetary Policy in the Post-Pandemic World.\" Many things changed both during COVID and after. First, there was an unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response to the pandemic. Second, structural changes have occurred, including supply chain issues and shifts in the organization of work. Finally, economies have been grappling with elevated inflation. This economic environment has raised several policy questions that the papers presented here attempt to answer. These are questions that policymakers, including those here today, must grapple with, even when the answers are far from apparent. Academic research provides insights into these questions and possible answers, ways to analyze the data, and the foundations for testing theories with economic models.\nThe papers presented here today and tomorrow are ideal examples of the kind of work that can help policymakers do their jobs better, and can facilitate the sharing of knowledge around the world. We have sessions on how firms' balance sheets, households' savings and borrowing decisions, as well as supply chains, influence monetary policy transmission. We also will look into financial market impacts and labor market considerations of the current policy environment.\nBefore we get to those presentations, and what I hope will be vigorous discussions, let me recognize several people who made this event possible. Here at the CBI, Stefano and Enrico Sette helped organize this conference. Enrico is a co-editor of the IJCB. Let me mention the other co-editors: Ana Babus, Diana Bonfim, Huberto Ennis, Carlos Garriga, Refet G\u00fcrkaynak, \u00d2scar Jord\u00e0, Robin Lumsdaine, Fernanda Nechio, and Steven Ongena. This conference and the day-to-day smooth running of the journal couldn't be accomplished without the editorial team at the BIS and the Board of Governors. A special thank you goes to Kommaly Dias and Jessica Flagg from my staff. And, finally, a big thank you to my adviser Jane Ihrig, who does so much for me and who worked to oversee the process at the IJCB this past year.\nAnd with that, I will step away from the microphone and put the spotlight where it should be, on the scholars presenting their work today. Thank you.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            July 08, 2024",

Kugler\nAt the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for your introduction, Adam, and thank you for the invitation to speak here today. It is great to come to Peterson to discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy, which is my topic this afternoon.\n1\nAs I stand here today, inflation remains too high, but I am encouraged by the overall progress and trajectory. Recent data on the economy and inflation also give me cautious optimism that we are on track and making continued headway toward the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) inflation goal of 2 percent. That progress may have paused in the first three months of the year, but information since then on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation points to renewed progress.\nOver the last year through April, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation was 2.7 percent, down from 7.1 percent at its peak in 2022. Core PCE inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094which excludes the volatile food and energy categories\u00e2\u0080\u0094was 2.8 percent through April, down from its peak of 5.6 percent. Based on consumer and producer price inflation for May released last week, I estimate that 12-month PCE inflation in May was a bit lower than in April. I was encouraged by some of the details of the recent reports, particularly the continued improvement in market-based services inflation, which is based on observation of actual market prices rather than imputed values. That's important because market-based prices are likely to be a better indication of the overall trend for core services inflation than nonmarket prices.\nHousing services inflation, meanwhile, continues to be persistent. Market rents for new tenant leases have already cooled significantly, but further progress in overall housing services inflation will rely on the ongoing pass-through of the previous market rents deceleration to the rents of existing tenants with expiring leases.\nSo inflation is still too high, and further progress is likely to be gradual. However, there are several reasons why I remain optimistic that improving supply and cooling demand will support continued disinflation.\nThe first reason I am optimistic about further progress on inflation has to do with declining price increases and even declining prices as consumers become more price sensitive. I think of this from several, related angles\u00e2\u0080\u0094I will mention a few.\nAs I have discussed in previous speeches, reduced frequency of price adjustments helps moderate prices. And the frequency with which firms adjust prices, which accelerated to less than every five months in early 2022, moved closer to every seven months as of the end of 2023.\n2\nPrice adjustment frequency picked up some early this year, along with the temporary firming of inflation, but the general trend has been consistent with ongoing disinflation.\nAn additional basis for price-setting optimism is the fact that longer-run inflation expectations have remained well anchored. Research by the Richmond Fed has found that price-setting decisions by firms are related to their own expectations about the path of overall inflation, so anchored inflation expectations among firms are likely to result in price setting consistent with those lower price expectations.\n3\nIn addition, there may still be room for markups of prices over labor costs to continue falling. While markups are famously difficult to measure, rough, simple estimates of markups of prices over labor costs have fallen back from high levels but still remain above their pre-pandemic trend, especially in the goods sector.\n4\nA return of markups to this trend could help ongoing progress toward 2 percent inflation.\nA final factor for optimism about positive price-setting developments is the range of anecdotes from firms themselves. The most recent edition of the Fed's Beige Book suggests firms are increasingly attentive to consumers pushing back against additional price increases and that these businesses expect to increase prices only moderately in the near term. Beyond the Beige Book, I have gleaned from recent earnings reports by publicly traded companies that lower-income consumers are pulling back from their purchasing and that firms are responding by moderating price increases or, in some cases, actually cutting prices. What I have heard in my own conversations with business contacts is that consumers are \"trading down\" to lower-cost products and that firms are responding with more discounting. And some large retailers have publicly spoken about cutting prices in the face of resistant consumers. These various indicators\u00e2\u0080\u0094markups, price adjustment frequency, inflation expectations, and anecdotes from a range of sources\u00e2\u0080\u0094suggest that, on balance, price-setting behavior is likely to continue to move closer to consistency with the FOMC's inflation target.\nA second reason for my optimism about continued disinflation is slower growth in the costs faced by businesses. Among those, nominal wages are a big part of total costs in the services sector. Nominal wage growth has continued to trend down, consistent with a labor market where supply and demand are coming into better balance. Of course, as a general matter, I want to see Americans experiencing strong wage growth, but for that wage growth to be sustainable, it must be consistent with our inflation target. Notably, as inflation has come down, real wages have been rising and now exceed pre-pandemic levels, which means that the purchasing power of workers has also been increasing. But at the same time, we have seen slowing growth in nominal labor costs. For example, the 12-month increase in average hourly earnings has been running just above 4 percent over the past couple of months after peaking at around 6 percent in 2022 and falling more or less steadily since then. The latest readings compare with an average of around 3 percent a year before the pandemic, when inflation was running below our 2 percent goal. Wage moderation is especially evident in some service sectors for which labor is a large share of costs. If this moderation in wage growth continues, it will soon be at levels consistent with price stability. And I note that the market-based services inflation measure I mentioned earlier tends to move closely with wage growth.\nOther developments in labor markets also point toward continued resilience, but there are signs of gradual cooling and continued wage moderation. Gains in payrolls averaged 218,000 over the past two months, which is a solid pace. But most other indicators point to a slow but steady easing of the labor market, supported by cooling demand for hiring as well as strong supply.\nIn terms of demand, both the job openings rate and the hiring rate have come down from their highs of late 2021 and early 2022. The job opening rate is not far above its pre-pandemic range, and the hiring rate is below pre-pandemic. Surveys of business hiring intentions likewise suggest cooler demand for workers. On the supply side, we have seen notable growth in labor supply over the past year. Labor force participation among prime-age women, in particular, reached another all-time record in May. And the strong inflows of immigrants I have discussed in previous speeches have continued this year, which points to continued labor supply growth as recent immigrants gradually make their way into the labor market.\nWith cooling demand and solid supply, measures of labor market tightness have continued to ease. The unemployment rate has been gradually rising and reached 4 percent in May, still very low in historical terms and the 30th straight month at 4 percent or lower. Another indicator of labor market tightness, the ratio of job vacancies to the number of people counted as looking for work, crossed an important threshold in April. After rising as high as 2 vacancies for each person seeking a job during the pandemic, that ratio fell to 1.2, which was the level before the pandemic. Another indicator of labor market tightness, the rate of people voluntarily quitting their jobs, is actually below the pre-pandemic level. The average duration for job vacancies is down, and it is becoming easier for employers to fill jobs. We policymakers like to make our judgments based on a preponderance of the data, and a preponderance of the labor market data indicates that labor market supply and demand are coming into better balance.\nA third reason for my optimism about achieving 2 percent inflation is that I am also cautiously optimistic about productivity growth, which is a source of supply expansion that is likely to put downward pressure on inflation without slower economic growth. One factor is the remarkable rise in the rate of new business creation, which started early in the pandemic and has continued, more or less, even through last month.\n5\nEconomic research finds that while many new and young firms struggle to survive, a small subset of new firms are highly productive and grow rapidly, eventually making significant contributions to aggregate productivity.\n6\nAnd the pandemic-era business creation surge has been particularly strong in high-tech sectors, such as computer systems design and research and development services.\n7\nSome recent history favors a payoff to productivity growth from this surge in entrepreneurship. Before the jump in productivity growth in the late 1990s through the early 2000s, there was a similar wave of strong business entries in high-tech industries.\n8\nI suspect that most of the productivity benefits of the recent entry surge are still ahead of us.\nAnother basis for productivity optimism is the prospect for widespread implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in its various forms. To be sure, there is tremendous uncertainty around the future path of AI and its effects on the economy, and we must all think carefully about how it may affect workers and the kinds of tasks they perform. But AI technology has the potential to make workers and firms more productive\u00e2\u0080\u0094effectively boosting aggregate supply. Of course, many technologies can take a long time to show through to aggregate productivity. The spread of electrification more than a century ago required complementary assets like power lines and appliances to be created and installed. But I suspect that AI may diffuse more quickly, in part because many of the complementary assets needed for the initial spread of AI\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as computers, networks, and the like\u00e2\u0080\u0094are already in place, even while there is still an enormous amount of additional hardware buildout still ahead of us. And survey data from the Census Bureau suggest that firms in many sectors are already employing AI.\n9\nOnly time will tell, of course, but the prospect of higher productivity growth raises the possibility that inflation can fall without a significant slowdown in economic activity and employment.\nMy fourth and final reason for optimism on inflation is that I believe the current stance of monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to help cool the economy and bring inflation back toward 2 percent without a sharp contraction in economic activity or a significant deterioration of the labor market. Interest rates remain elevated relative to a year ago, and certainly relative to two or three years ago, and are restricting economic activity. Of course, some aspects of financial conditions, such as house prices and, especially, stock prices, remain robust; and credit is still generally available, though high interest rates make borrowing expensive. These factors likely have some distributional implications: Higher-income people with large stock portfolios may not feel that conditions are so restrictive, while lower earners who need to borrow to buy a house or a car do not need to be told that finances are tight.\nBut the overall restrictiveness of financial conditions is apparent in interest rate\u00e2\u0080\u0093sensitive sectors. For example, the level of residential investment in the first quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0094though showing some modest improvement relative to last year's pace\u00e2\u0080\u0094was still roughly 15 percent below its peak in 2021. Business investment in equipment contracted a bit in 2023 and showed only tepid growth in the first quarter of this year. And while consumption growth has been resilient over the past couple of years, fueled in part by excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and solid real wages that now exceed pre-pandemic levels, it slowed noticeably in the first quarter, especially for spending on goods. Indeed, high interest rates have left a mark on consumer assessments of buying conditions for motor vehicles and other large durable goods, which often have to be financed.\n10\nThe effects of restrictive financial conditions are also evident in labor markets. As I discussed earlier, the labor market has cooled gradually, and, looking ahead, I expect some cooling of economic activity to continue. But I am watching closely for any signs of labor market deterioration that may take hold, as the FOMC also pays attention to the other side of our mandate.\nNotwithstanding my optimism about the economic outlook, I am mindful of a number of risks to both sides of the dual mandate. On the inflation side, the resurgence of import prices at the beginning of the year is concerning, even if import prices came down some last month, and could anticipate greater pressure on goods prices in the coming months. Goods prices have been a key source of disinflation over the past year or so, as supply chains have healed. While supply chains appear to have been fairly resilient to a series of shocks since the end of last year\u00e2\u0080\u0094including attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and low water levels in the Panama Canal\u00e2\u0080\u0094geopolitical developments in Ukraine and the Middle East still could lead to a sharp rise in global energy and food prices and disrupt global supply chains. Another risk I am focused on is that a further cooling of the U.S. economy could lead to a sharp deterioration in labor market conditions. Output growth appears to have slowed in the first half of this year, and while consumer spending still grew in the first quarter, the May retail sales report we received this morning may be another signal that the long-expected deceleration in consumer spending may finally be upon us. After a considerable decline in job vacancies, firms facing decreasing demand might increasingly resort to laying off workers. Lastly, I also see risks to the global economy that could spill back to the U.S. economy. While growth in some countries\u00e2\u0080\u0094notably in Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0094appears to be picking up from a soft patch last year, that pickup remains tentative. And the latest data from China suggest that economic momentum there has slowed considerably amid",

Cook\nAt the 2024 Marshall Forum: A U.S.-U.K. Strategic and Economic Dialogue, Chicago, Illinois\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, John. And thank you to the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission and the commissioners for this most extraordinary honor. To be mentioned alongside previous Marshall Medal recipients, such as Secretary Madeleine Albright, Secretary Colin Powell, Justice Stephen Breyer, and eminent political scientist and university president Nan Keohane, is humbling. The distinction is especially meaningful to me, because I have taken great pride in being a Marshall Scholar from the moment I was selected during my senior year at Spelman College. In the years since, I have enjoyed meeting and being inspired by Marshall Scholars throughout the country and around the world. I also have enjoyed reviewing the applications of future Marshall Scholars, one way in which I have taken seriously the responsibility to serve as an ambassador for the program. I look forward to continuing to serve in such an ambassadorial role as a Marshall Medal recipient. Again, I am beyond grateful to the Commission for the truly humbling and thrilling honor.\n1\nMy Marshall experience completely changed my thinking about my life and career. The people I met had many different interests and experiences and were preparing for careers I had never heard of until I began my studies at the University of Oxford. I relished learning more about British culture and immersing myself in one of the U.K.'s and the world's storied universities. Likewise, I took pride in the fact that I could share my ideas, culture, and experiences with others during my time as a Marshall Scholar, and I forged strong friendships that endure to this day. Gaining a fuller understanding of the friendship and respect between the U.S. and U.K., and the global importance of these two economies and democracies, has held me in good stead for many years and continues to be important in my current role as a member of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.\nIn fact, I had my eyes on studying in Europe as far back as junior high school, when, during Latin class, I dreamed of following the Appian Way and other Roman routes that stretched from Britain to Israel to Morocco. I was eager to put my Girl Scout navigation and itinerary-building skills to the test on another continent. My first taste of European life came during my junior year abroad, when I won a Charles L. Merrill Scholarship to study in Strasbourg, France. During spring break of that year, I purchased a student Britrail pass and traveled to London, Southampton, and Stratford-upon-Avon. I met students and other people from all over Europe throughout the year, and I had many conversations on trains, ferries, and beaches, as well as in hostels and homes to which I was invited. I was immensely grateful to be able to do so many things my parents never had the opportunity to do, and I was eager to continue such experiences. As a result, on the advice of my mentors at Spelman\u00e2\u0080\u0094Professors Ethel Githii, Margery Ganz, and Lois Moreland\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as the president at the time, Donald M. Stewart, I applied for the Marshall Scholarship and was humbled to be the first Spelman student to receive it.\nTransformative Experience\nReflecting on the essay I wrote for my Marshall application, I invoked Plato's allegory of the cave from Book VII of the\nRepublic\nto describe the transformation in my world view that occurred during my junior year abroad when it was challenged almost daily. My time as a Marshall Scholar would become the next phase of this ongoing transformation.\nWhen I arrived in Oxford, I was excited and transfixed. The bucolic setting of Oxford was conducive to learning and sharing ideas. As a philosophy major at Spelman and long a student of Latin and the classics, I was incredulous that I had the chance to study philosophy at Oxford with a tutor employing the Socratic method. It was a dream come true. I lived with students from all over the world and made life-long friends. My studies at Oxford shined a bit more light on the subject of economics, perhaps subtly beginning the transformation to my eventual career. In my first (Michaelmas) term, I had a tutorial in mathematical economics, only my third economics course ever. I learned a lot, and I was surprised that I loved it! Maybe that should have been a hint? However, I did not choose it as my concentration. I had to select two subjects out of the three from philosophy, politics, and economics. I chose philosophy and politics, because I thought economics was too much fun.\nMy most influential tutor, as we called our professors at Oxford, was philosopher of mind and metaphysics Galen Strawson. Through my interactions with him, he helped me answer the question, \"How does one construct a thoughtful, systematic world view?\" After I completed my studies at Oxford, Galen also helped me hone further academic pursuits and advised me on plans that ultimately led me to pursue a PhD in economics. He was generous with his time and offered very useful advice in comparing British and American economics programs.\nOutside of my studies, I enjoyed participating in extracurricular activities that I did not have the opportunity to participate in during high school or college. Those included the Oxford Union, the debate society, and traveling through Italy, Greece, and the Middle East during spring break of my first year. One of my favorite experiences at Oxford was producing, acting in, and serving as the dialect coach for the performance of \"For Colored Girls\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\" by Ntozake Shange. I did so alongside my still very close friends, Ambassador Susan Rice and Congresswoman Terri Sewell. It was sponsored by the Oxford University Dramatic Society and presented in the historic Oscar Wilde Theatre at Magdalen College. It was the first time \"For Colored Girls\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\" was put on at Oxford, because it was the first time there were six Black women to put it on! I helped actors from Liverpool and Trinidad and Tobago (and some from the U.S.) learn regional American accents. They joined four of us from the U.S. in the show, which included singing the Aretha Franklin hit \"Respect.\" We sold out every single show.\nIn addition to sharing American culture, I picked up on the cultural influences of the British Isles. Songs from Irish rock band U2, such as \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" and \"New Year's Day,\" seemed to constantly play in the background during my time at Oxford. That exposure proved vital a few years later when I was teaching at Harvard and two gentleman named Paul and David came to speak to my colleagues and me about debt relief for highly indebted poor countries. Initially, I did not understand why everyone was abuzz about these visitors, until someone whispered the familiar song titles in my ear. Those words instantly transported me back to my time in Britain. I was, of course, speaking to Bono and The Edge.\nLasting Bonds\nWhile the U.S. and U.K. share close cultural bonds\u00e2\u0080\u0094look no further than James Bond, Adele,\nDownton Abbey\n, Tom Jones,\nMonty Python\n, and\nBridgerton\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094the relationship between the two countries runs much deeper than that. The Marshall Scholarship has its roots with George C. Marshall and the history-changing partnership between the U.S. and U.K during World War II. It is easy to see why a long friendship has endured. We share a language (for the most part!), a history, and a belief in democratic values. Our close economic ties are one aspect of the U.S.-U.K. relationship that stands out. Our countries feature two of the world's great financial centers and share other important connections. The U.K. is the top destination of U.S. direct investment and is the second-largest source of direct investment into this country. The U.S. is the U.K.'s largest trading partner, with 22 percent of U.K. exports heading here last year.\nOur central banks have a close relationship as well. We at the Fed respect and work with our counterparts at the Bank of England, including through the Bank for International Settlements, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the G7, and the G20. Given our similar economic structures and banking systems, there is always much to learn from each other to help ensure a resilient financial system. Those efforts are especially important to me as I serve as chair of the Board's Committee on Financial Stability. We know economic shocks tend to reverberate around the world, so having clear and open communication with my fellow central bankers plays a valuable part in assuring financial stability.\nIt has been wonderful to have the opportunity today to reflect on my time as a Marshall Scholar and to consider how it more fully opened my eyes, allowing me to pursue my career and my passions. As a girl from a small town in Georgia, I debated and discussed ideas and issues during and outside of my tutorials that I had never done before. I met people from many different parts of the U.K. and the world I had never encountered before and who held views I had never heard articulated before. And that, I think, is the very spirit of the Marshall Scholarship and the Marshall Medal: building respect and understanding and strengthening the enduring friendship between our two countries.\nOnce again, thank you so very much to the Marshall Commission for this honor. I am most grateful and humbled to receive it.\n1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\nReturn to text\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            June 17, 2024",

Bowman\nAt The Salzburg Global Seminar on Financial Technology Innovation, Social Impact, and Regulation: Do We Need New Paradigms?, Salzburg, Austria\nShare\nIt is a pleasure to be back in Salzburg again for the next chapter in the Global Seminar, focusing on financial technology innovations and the developing financial regulatory framework.\n1\nAt this same gathering last year, we discussed the potential evolution of the bank regulatory framework in response to the banking stress during the spring of 2023. At that time, we were taking stock of the regulatory reforms implemented after the 2008 financial crisis and evaluating whether those reforms\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the resulting bank regulatory and supervisory framework we have now\u00e2\u0080\u0094were effective and efficient, and whether improvements may be appropriate. Of course, many of those conversations are ongoing in the United States, with proposals\u00e2\u0080\u0094in varying levels of formality\u00e2\u0080\u0094under discussion, including new and expanded long-term debt requirements for non-global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), new liquidity requirements, and a host of other supervisory and regulatory reforms. These are in addition to other regulatory reform matters, including Basel III capital reforms and changes to the G-SIB surcharge framework, that are not directly related to the 2023 banking stress.\nPolicy reforms in the United States, at times and to varying degrees, have arguably suffered from a lack of appropriate prioritization and focus.\n2\nThis trend has been evident recently, when one considers the sheer volume of reforms that have recently been completed, that have been proposed, or that are in the pipeline. Often shortchanged in the rush to implement reforms are considerations of effectiveness and efficiency\u00e2\u0080\u0094effectiveness in addressing identified shortcomings, and efficiency in providing solutions that address these shortcomings without imposing unnecessary costs or compliance burdens or resulting in unintended consequences.\nWhile much of the reform agenda in the United States has been focused on the response to the 2023 banking stress, in my view, we also need to consider whether we have an appropriate bank regulatory and supervisory framework when it comes to innovation. So, today I would like to discuss how we can create a regulatory environment that fosters successful innovation. I will focus my remarks on the United States, specifically innovation within the \"regulatory perimeter\" in which regulated institutions\u00e2\u0080\u0094banks, holding companies, and their affiliates\u00e2\u0080\u0094operate. However, I think this approach has broader relevance for how regulation can more effectively support and promote innovation, including internationally.\nThe implications of our regulatory approach go beyond just the banking system. A reflexive \"no\" from regulators can encourage activity to migrate out of the banking system. The result could be decreased transparency, lower regulatory standards, and increased risks to financial stability. We tend to think that the \"stakes\" are confined to a particular technology or innovation, but this is a misleading approach. Instead, we should adopt a broader approach that considers financial system stability. To implement a successful \"same activity, same risk, same regulation\" approach requires either broad-based legislation to coordinate these standards or an effective interagency approach that incorporates regulators beyond traditional banking regulators.\nBenefits of Innovation\nIn my experience, regulators love innovation\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the abstract. The idea of innovation is an alluring one. Among other things, innovation can help develop a faster and more efficient banking and payments system, it can lower the cost and expand the availability of products and services to consumers and businesses, it can improve the speed and reduce counterparty risk of securities transactions, and it can promote market competition.\nAnd we see evidence all around in the banking system where innovation has had transformative effects: we have automated teller machines (ATMs) that allow ready access to cash and basic account services, we have the ability to make electronic payments at merchants both in-person and online, and almost every bank customer can access their bank account or transfer money to a friend by using only their mobile phone. When innovation becomes commonplace, and with the passage of time, we lose sight of the long and sometimes tortured road these innovators traveled to introduce and embed them into customer expectations for banking services.\nI see a common theme between innovation as an abstract idea and \"established\" innovation that has become the new norm in the financial landscape\u00e2\u0080\u0094namely, that neither of these versions force us to confront the risks of the unknown. The abstract version does not force us to confront its practical implications, including: How does it work? What benefits could it bring? What risks does it present, and how will those risks be managed? Similarly, by the point at which the innovation becomes widely adopted and accepted, hopefully we have done the difficult work. We have come to understand the challenges it presents and have accepted the tradeoffs between the benefits, and the associated risks and costs, of allowing the new technology or process improvement to be introduced into the banking system.\nWhen we think about the abstract, or look back on successful innovation, we lose sight of the unique path forged to ensure its success. Many of the technologies that we will discuss during this conference have the potential to bring benefits, including greater efficiency to banking and payments. So how do we create an environment that allows innovation to flourish and in which regulated banking institutions are able to play a role? In the past I have spoken about three principles that I believe are necessary building blocks to fostering innovation: developing an understanding of the technology, having an open approach to innovation, and making innovation a priority in the development of regulatory frameworks.\n3\nI would like to revisit these principles today.\nUnderstanding Innovation\nAs a threshold matter, regulators and innovators share some responsibilities when it comes to innovation. Regulators must work hard to understand the functionality of new innovation, including the benefits innovation can bring and its accompanying risks. Regulators must not fall into the trap of complacency. Comfort with the known and familiar risks of how things have always been done can present a barrier. Regulators must be willing to thoughtfully consider the possibilities of innovation within the regulated banking system.\nAt the same time, innovators must be committed to sharing their understanding and knowledge of innovation with regulators. But in doing so, innovators must not adopt the \"sales\" mentality that they may use when pitching investors or partners, and instead, acknowledge the unknowns\u00e2\u0080\u0094the risks that new technology presents, the various ways that the technology could be used or evolve over time, and how the technology could either complement or disrupt the current financial system. Going a step further, they may be best positioned to propose how regulators can best develop a regulatory framework to manage these risks.\nThis deeper level of understanding may assist regulators in their responsibility to consider how innovation could impact different financial sectors, from small banks to wholesale financial markets, and how those impacts may ultimately affect end users. Of course, regulators must also consider not only the intended objectives of innovation, but they must also anticipate and understand the unintended consequences.\nWithin the broad category of \"understanding\" innovation, I see three critical steps that regulators must take: understand the technology and landscape, recognize the use case for the technology, and anticipate the consequences. Each of these is a necessary ingredient for accepting the technology and developing a regulatory framework that effectively fosters innovation.\nUnderstanding technology and the landscape\nAt its most basic level, many innovations involve a technological component and are situated in a landscape of different parties who may play a role in the use of the technology.\nTake for example, distributed ledger technology (DLT), including blockchain, which is the backbone of some innovations that are being explored in the financial system. DLT highlights the challenges presented to regulators in understanding innovation. There are many variations in the application of DLT\u00e2\u0080\u0094with ongoing research and development creating more variability over time\u00e2\u0080\u0094which ultimately may complicate understanding how the technology can be used and how different functionality can be incorporated into DLT solutions for different use cases. DLT provides a way for parties to record transfers of digital assets without the need for any centralized authority and relies on multiple participants who coordinate to maintain a synchronized version of the \"ledger.\" DLT combines a number of different design elements\u00e2\u0080\u0094like distributed data storage, cryptography, and consensus mechanisms\u00e2\u0080\u0094that support the transfer process, information visibility, and transaction recordkeeping. These design elements can be combined in a number of different ways, and different parties may play a role in its ultimate use.\nUnderstanding technology is an important first step, but regulators also need to be confident in the players who operate in a particular innovative space. Banks of all sizes have a long history of innovation. And the many nonbank providers in this space, including core service providers, often hold the \"keys\" to innovation when they facilitate the add-on of new technology to core systems. There are also fintechs that may focus on even more transformational uses of technology, in ways that can affect all aspects of banking. Many of the parties involved in financial innovation describe themselves as financial system \"disruptors.\" This may be an apt word to describe some of their ambitions, but it is certainly one that proves the need for a deliberate and cautious approach to regulation. The broad range of participants involved in this space presents another layer of complication. It is especially important for regulators to be able to distill the reality from the prototype hype to achieve a comprehensive understanding necessary to inform a policy viewpoint and ultimately an effective regulatory framework.\nUnderstanding the use case\nApart from understanding the technology, and who may use it, regulators also need to clearly understand the use case\u00e2\u0080\u0094what existing problem does this technology solve? What are the costs and benefits, and are there tradeoffs policymakers would need to consider if the new technology were introduced or integrated in the existing financial system? DLT has inspired new ways of thinking about the exchange of assets and data, in addition to the role of intermediaries and trusted third parties. And of course, as will be discussed during this conference, artificial intelligence, or \"AI,\" is increasingly discussed for its transformative potential not only in banking, but also in the broader world economy.\nWhile innovation can take many forms, from the regulatory perspective, it is helpful to understand how innovation fits\u00e2\u0080\u0094or could fit\u00e2\u0080\u0094into the existing financial system. Does innovation meet customer demands for cheaper or new and innovative products? Does it operate in the background to reduce both the incidence and cost of fraud? Does it lower the cost of basic banking services or improve financial inclusion? Does it allow banks to do a better job evaluating the creditworthiness of their customers and make safer loans?\nThe \"use case\" is important because it helps to define the parameters around any particular innovation. Instead of saying the innovation is AI, or tokenization, or DLT, what is it exactly? How does it work? What technology underpins it, and what constraints would be placed on its use? Does its implementation rely on external participants or third parties to accomplish its use? Who has ultimate control over, and responsibility for, the function of the product or service?\nUnderstanding the consequences\nWhile understanding both the technology behind a new innovation and its use case is important, these steps alone are not sufficient. Regulators must also understand, to the extent possible, the consequences of specific innovations. Take, for example, the increasing interest in tokenization. There is a risk that tokenized products and platforms could duplicate existing bank deposits and payment rails, potentially creating parallel systems. How would these parallel systems interact with, or even replace, current systems? Will the products and platforms that duplicate these deposit and payment functions provide the same legal protections for customers and the overall financial system that they currently receive? In the long run, the goal of financial innovation is to integrate the new technology into the fabric of the financial system. To do so in a responsible way, we need to understand the effects the technology will have, including the risks and consequences of introducing it, and the risks and consequences of its wide adoption in the financial system.\nIt is not my intent to downplay the difficulty of understanding new developments that could change key activities, technology, products, or processes within the financial system. We are in an era of rapid change, and there are a wide range of innovations that may play an important role in the future of the financial system. But within the regulatory perimeter of the banking system, we need to be cautious about the risks of new technology, not only to the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, but also to financial stability concerns.\nOpenness to Innovation\nEarlier I mentioned the importance of ensuring the regulator understands the new technology. But while education is an important first step, it often runs headlong into regulatory skepticism. Often, a regulator's first reaction to proposed innovation in the banking system is not one of openness and acceptance but rather suspicion and concern. The use of emerging technology and innovation may require a change in policy or supervisory approach. It also very often requires regulatory feedback\u00e2\u0080\u0094ideally before the innovation is introduced or after it has been integrated by a bank and is reviewed during the supervisory process.\nTo be sure, skepticism is an understandable first reaction to new activities, particularly those that someone seeks to conduct within the regulatory perimeter after its ",

Cook\nAt Celebrating 50 Years of the American Economic Association Summer Program, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nI am delighted to celebrate 50 years of the American Economic Association's Summer Program (AEASP) with you this evening.\n1\nThis is a momentous achievement and an historic moment. Not only is the program's continued success a testament to the dedicated efforts of the various faculty, fellows, and administrators, but it is also a testament to the achievements and efforts of its students and alumni. I am incredibly proud of all of you, the program, and its legacy. As an alumna of the program at Stanford University, I was deeply humbled, honored, grateful, and proud to be named co-director and then director of the AEA Summer Program at Michigan State University (MSU) from 2016 to 2020. I am also honored to be the first woman to have served as director of the program and proud to have worked with such an extraordinary group of instructors, administrators, seminar speakers, graduate students, and partners from all over the country who sacrificed their summers and time throughout the year over five years to execute this program each summer. The leadership team\u00e2\u0080\u0094Thomas Jeitschko, Christine Moser (from Western Michigan University), Antonio Doblas-Madrid, Mary Wortley, and Kirstin Heard\u00e2\u0080\u0094were great colleagues and instrumental in implementing the program each year. Finally, I am eternally grateful to the staff and leadership of the American Economic Association, who provided critical infrastructure, funding, and guidance; the National Science Foundation for its investment in training economists and in the future of economics; the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, our consummate host during our visit to Chicago each summer; the Board of Governors and individual Federal Reserve Banks for their support; and Western Michigan University, the co-sponsor of the program with MSU.\nI would like to share with you just a few lessons I learned while leading the AEASP at MSU. Although the program's main priority is to teach courses that will encourage and prepare students to pursue further study in economics, I would like to highlight a few other features that I think led to success.\nFirst, two key features of the AEASP team and program at MSU were humility and agility. As many of the former directors here know well, every program is a startup when it moves from one university to another. While we started with a detailed plan for all five years, we did not know how everything would turn out and had to be open to experimentation and innovation.\nAfter the first year, it became obvious that the program needed a systematic advising component. Armed with this intensive training in economics, the students still needed help planning next steps back at their home institutions and for the future. The second year, we instituted a mandatory advising session with a faculty administrator on the last day of the program. The students completed a survey with their educational objectives for the next two to three years, and we commented on them. This became a critical and ongoing souvenir of the program. It has been heartwarming to see program alumni stick to these plans and execute them many years after leaving the AEASP.\nDuring the second year, we also realized how important machine learning was becoming to conducting research and to preparing for graduate study in economics. One August, after the program was over, we enrolled in a machine learning short course, learned more about the power of these tools, and incorporated it into the program the next summer. Humility, agility, and being open to new ideas held us in good stead throughout the program in East Lansing.\nSecond, outreach and recruiting efforts are very important. My own journey and that of many others are evidence that not everyone comes to the field of economics the same way. In our experience, it was helpful to find novel ways to broaden our reach. In addition to traditional outreach methods, we engaged social media, including going to where economists were\u00e2\u0080\u0094EconTwitter\u00e2\u0080\u0094to introduce economics departments and interested students to the new program at MSU, to provide general information, and to give updates on students, program activities, and alumni. There were several memorable social media events: Two live social media sessions on different platforms, the Instagram photo contest, and the \"Selfies with Sue\" [Dynarski] sessions during our excursion to Detroit and Ann Arbor. Successful execution of a social-media strategy resulted in a more diverse applicant pool by type of educational institution and geographical location.\nThird, anyone can be a mentor and influence the trajectory of a student or young scholar interested in economics. Students spontaneously became peer mentors to each other, using time they could have used to do their own problem sets or study for their own exams to mentor a student struggling in a course or grappling with misgivings about the path to a PhD instead. Fellows (TAs) came from all over the country and from a variety of economics programs to support the AEASP students and each other as participants in the dissertation brown bag seminar. Instructors, some of whom came from a plethora of other institutions, like Western Michigan University and Barnard College, gave 110 percent to the program and mentored students inside and beyond the classroom, as well as beyond the program. Finally, it was extraordinary, if not moving, to witness so many economists from many different subfields and from around the country come forward and volunteer to be research mentors for the students, especially during the pandemic. I was grateful for all these important mentoring relationships that were forged, that made a substantial contribution to the program, and that demonstrated that anyone at any stage of their career in economics could be a mentor.\nBefore concluding, I want to take the opportunity to recognize my classmate at Berkeley, gifted and prolific economic theorist, friend, and mentor, Gary Charness. Gary was a dedicated instructor in the AEASP at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and provided very helpful advice as we got the MSU program up and running. He also embodied the notion that people come to economics in different ways, as I mentioned earlier, having had a full career before undertaking graduate work in economics. He passed away last month; otherwise, given his legendary commitment to the program, I believe he would have been here to celebrate with us.\nIn closing, as an alumna and former director, I feel great joy witnessing the success of the AEASP students and alumni, with many having enrolled in economics PhD programs and others having pursued master's degrees or taken research jobs, including at the Board of Governors and elsewhere in the Federal Reserve System. AEASP alumni also have received National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships and other competitive fellowships for graduate study. I hope that current AEASP students and alumni will continue not only their own research efforts but also their connections with each other and with a broader network of mentors and alumni.\nCongratulations, again, on a half century of the AEA Summer Program! I am honored to have been a part of this important initiative and wonderful event. I am beyond grateful to Marcus Alexis, James Tobin, Andrew Brimmer, Robert Dorfman, Charles Schultze, George Borts, and all of the other founders and early supporters of the program for their vision and to the National Economic Association and all those who have contributed to advocating for and executing this vision over the years. With great pride for its past achievements, I look forward to seeing the program's legacy embodied in the future endeavors of each of its participants. Best of luck over the next 50 years!\n1.

Cook\nAt the Girls Global Academy 2024 Commencement Ceremony, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nThank you, Dr. O'Neal. It is an honor to be here to celebrate with you\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Girls Global Academy's first-ever graduating class. This is a momentous achievement and occasion. You are making history today! But, of course, you could not have done it alone. So let me start by acknowledging the teachers; administrators, staff, and board members of the Girls Global Academy; and the parents, grandparents, siblings, mentors, and friends who made today possible. Thank you and congratulations on a job well done.\nAnd a very special congratulations to the Girls Global Academy Class of 2024! Soon you will embark on new journeys. I understand that many of you are going on to college in the fall, including one of you heading to my alma mater, Spelman College. (Be sure not to miss the 144th Founders Day celebration next year and the annual Spelman-Morehouse Christmas Carol concert in historic Sisters Chapel.) Others are off to start careers or to pursue vocational training. One of you will enter public service directly and become a member of the U.S. Air Force. That is a lot to be proud of and excited about. Whatever path you take next, I know the education and experience you gained here will guide you.\nThe Class of 2024 stands out. This is not only because you are the first, but also because you achieved so much all while overcoming extremely challenging circumstances by starting high school during the pandemic. Like you, I know what it is like to be the first to take a path, a path that was not always smooth and predictable. I will tell you more about that shortly.\nFour years ago, all of you could have taken a more well-marked route. Instead, you had the courage to enroll at a brand new school during a global pandemic. You learned virtually during your first year. When you were able to attend your school in person for the first time, you did so with masks on, while social distancing. Forging new friendships is always challenging. It is even harder when you cannot sit next to a new classmate at the lunch table. But I know you worked hard to move your learning and your friendships beyond the screens and into real life. Now that those bonds have formed, I hope you hold on to them for many years to come, as I did with my classmates at a women's college.\nAs the inaugural class of the Girls Global Academy, your list of firsts is long and impressive. You formed the academy's first ever student government. You started a debate team and created cooking and DJ clubs, to name a few. You took the court and field as the first volleyball, basketball, softball, track, and cross-country teams. (I would have gone out for the softball and track teams. I was a catcher on my softball team in junior high and shot put was my event on the track team in high school.)\nEverything was new, and probably a bit scary. Yet, you learned to become outspoken, you took on leadership roles, and you set an example for younger students. Through it all you grew, and you became the remarkable young women you are today.\nWith all those firsts, I was told that you sometimes call yourselves \"the guinea pigs.\" I get that. However, I would like to offer a different moniker for this group: trailblazers. You bravely went where no one had gone before, and you accomplished great things through difficult challenges. To honor that, I want to tell you about a favorite trailblazer of mine and a girl who looked up to her.\nThe trailblazer I am thinking of is Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander. A little more than a century ago, she graduated from high school here in Washington, D.C., less than a mile away from your school. It was then called M Street High School. She went on to earn bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. During her doctoral studies, she undertook research on the living standards of Black families that were migrating to Philadelphia during World War I. After completing that work, she became the second African American woman ever to earn a PhD and the first African American to earn a PhD in economics.\nBut in the 1920s, Dr. Alexander was actively denied entry into the economics profession on the basis of her race and sex. Some might have been crushed and deterred by the impediment. Not Dr. Alexander. Instead, she went on to blaze another trail. She became the first African American woman to earn a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Alexander was also the first African American woman to pass the bar and practice law in the state of Pennsylvania. She continued to think and write about economic issues in her legal work and public service. She went on to be a top attorney for the city of Philadelphia and served the public in many other ways, including being asked by two U.S. presidents to serve on important committees.\nDr. Alexander was also the first national president of Delta Sigma Theta, a public service sorority. My mother helped to start a Delta Sigma Theta chapter at Georgia College and State University. That is how I first learned about Dr. Alexander. In fact, when I was in seventh grade, I entered my county social science fair with a project inspired by her work: identifying the major causes of unemployment among Black Americans. I did not realize it then, but that turned out to be my first foray into economic research, which became the cornerstone of my career.\nIt was helpful to have trailblazers to look up to, including Dr. Alexander, but also my aunts, uncles, parents, and other relatives and family friends who played important roles in the Civil Rights Movement. They instilled in me the confidence to blaze trails of my own. I was among the first African American students to desegregate one of the schools I attended in my hometown of Milledgeville, Georgia. Although some of the students and others in the community did not welcome us, I drew strength from the example set by my family and others in the Civil Rights Movement, and from their conviction in the hope and promise of a world that could and would continually improve.\nWhile I had an interest in economics even before I entered high school, that profession was not the first path I choose. I started Spelman as a physics and philosophy major. It was not until after my undergraduate years, when I was literally on a trail\u00e2\u0080\u0094one climbing Mount Kilimanjaro\u00e2\u0080\u0094that I discovered economics was the path for me. I was hiking alongside a British economist. By the end of that journey, he had convinced me that studying economics would provide me the tools to address some big and important questions I had pondered for a long time\u00e2\u0080\u0094as far back as when Dr. Alexander inspired my submission to the county social science fair.\nFollowing in her footsteps, I went on to earn my PhD in economics from the University of California, Berkeley. The path of an economist led me many places, including to Moscow to research banking in pre- and post-Soviet Russia and to the White House as an economist for President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In 2022, President Biden nominated me to serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. I am proud to say that I am the first African American woman and first woman of color to serve on the Board of Governors, a body that makes decisions affecting the entire economy and the well-being of every American.\nI hope that my story, and Dr. Alexander's story, might inspire you to see that even when you encounter roadblocks, you can chart your own path and achieve great things. I know you can do that, because you established a strong foundation here at the Girls Global Academy, starting with the four pillars of sisterhood, scholarship, service, and safety.\nI can see you have the spirit of sisterhood today as you celebrate all your achievements. You established a sisterhood as the first Girls Global Academy alumnae, and you also joined a broader sisterhood of strong, courageous, trailblazing women. You are scholars, earning your diploma and going on to college and onto various career paths. You worked in service to your community by each completing at least 50 service hours. The scholarship and service pillars show that you are already like Dr. Alexander, who highly valued education and used her education to improve the world. And you certainly learned the importance of safety as you started high school in the pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the importance of creating a safe environment of belonging where you can learn, be challenged, and grow, while comfortably being yourself. Holding these four pillars close will serve you well as you take the next step in your journeys.\nAs I conclude, I would like to thank you for allowing me to add another first\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first Girls Global Academy commencement speaker. I am deeply humbled by this honor. Once again, congratulations to the very first Girls Global Academy graduating class\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Class of 2024! We are all so proud of you and cannot wait to see what you will do.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            June 07, 2024",

Bowman\nAt the 2024 BOJ-IMES Conference, hosted by the Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies, Bank of Japan, Tokyo, Japan\nShare\nI would like to thank the Bank of Japan and Governor Ueda for organizing this year's conference and for the invitation to participate in this afternoon's panel.\n1\nThe topic of \"the effects of conventional and unconventional policy instruments\" is an important one given central banks' expanded use of unconventional monetary policy tools to pursue their mandates over the past decade and a half.\nMy remarks focus on the use of the central bank balance sheet as a monetary policy tool. I will first offer some observations regarding the benefits and costs of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) by reflecting on the two episodes of the Federal Reserve's active use of the balance sheet in U.S. monetary policy following the 2008 financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic. I will then discuss some considerations regarding future balance sheet policy as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) seeks to bring inflation back down to its 2 percent target following the post-pandemic inflation surge, and as the FOMC continues to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.\nLessons Learned from Past Uses of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet as a Monetary Policy Tool\nPost-2008 financial crisis balance sheet policy\nA key challenge for the FOMC following the 2008 financial crisis was how to provide additional support to an economy that was experiencing high unemployment and subdued inflation after the FOMC lowered its primary and conventional monetary policy tool\u00e2\u0080\u0094the target range for the federal funds rate\u00e2\u0080\u0094to near zero. Given the importance of longer-term interest rates for broader asset prices and for investment and consumption decisions, the FOMC used both forward guidance and LSAPs to help lower longer-term rates, which had not yet moved to zero. The intent of forward guidance was to lower longer-term interest rates by shifting expectations of \"low-for-long\" short-term interest rates in line with a low-for-long federal funds rate. LSAPs, or quantitative easing (QE), were intended to reduce longer-term interest rates further by lowering the yields of specific longer-dated securities being purchased and by reducing more generally the term premia, the compensation that investors must earn to incentivize investment in a longer-term bond relative to a short-term bond. LSAPs could also reinforce the FOMC's forward guidance of low-for-long short-term interest rates. Such reinforcement of low-for-long forward guidance could be especially powerful if the FOMC communicated that it would not consider raising the target range for the federal funds rate until it stopped actively engaging in asset purchases for the purposes of QE.\nThe Federal Reserve purchased both Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) as part of its QE programs from 2009 to 2014.\nFigure 1\ni\nshows the evolution of the Federal Reserve balance sheet assets and liabilities from before the 2008 financial crisis to the present. The Fed's Treasury and agency securities holdings increased from around half a trillion dollars to around $4.25 trillion by the end of the third round of QE, which ended in 2014. A range of studies indicate that the Fed's asset purchases were effective in raising the prices of and lowering the yields on the targeted class of securities.\n2\nResearch suggests that these asset purchases also helped lower term and risk premia across other asset classes, including corporate securities.\n3\nThe impact on the MBS pricing and credit flow was significant since securities prices in this asset class were especially impacted during the financial crisis. Financial institutions holding MBS on their balance sheets, including banks, were also significantly affected.\nSome studies have documented that the Fed's agency MBS purchases encouraged banks to continue to lend as the prices of their on-balance-sheet MBS holdings rose in response to QE.\n4\nOverall, the evidence indicates that the Fed's LSAPs following the financial crisis helped support the economic recovery. The progress on the FOMC's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability was assisted by the further easing of financial conditions after the federal funds rate had reached its effective lower bound.\n5\nThe post\u00e2\u0080\u0093financial crisis period experience showed that securities purchases in a specific asset class could be effective for those asset classes that had experienced stress, as was the case with MBS during that period.\nThe Federal Reserve concluded its asset purchases in 2014, after initiating the tapering process in 2013. In 2017, the Fed began to reduce its securities holdings, which is often referred to as quantitative tightening (QT). In January 2019, the FOMC voted to operate monetary policy in an \"ample reserves\" environment.\n6\nThis change in the policy implementation framework had the effect of keeping the size of the balance sheet much larger and providing more liquidity to the banking system in normal times than had been the case before the financial crisis. The FOMC ended QT in August 2019, and balance sheet growth resumed in October 2019 through the purchase of U.S. Treasury bills and securities following a brief period of stress in money markets in which the interest rates on repurchase agreements and other short-term funding instruments jumped, as noted by the line labeled \"Repo Spike\" in figure 1. This stress was interpreted as an indication that the level of reserves had fallen below ample levels.\n7\nOverall, one could deem the post\u00e2\u0080\u0093financial crisis use of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as a monetary policy tool as a success. Unemployment fell and inflation remained near 2 percent through the period over which LSAPs were conducted. The FOMC was able to end LSAPs and eventually was able to partially unwind them, though the overall terminal size of the Fed's securities holdings as a share of GDP following the end of QT was much greater than before the financial crisis. This much larger end state was a direct result of the FOMC's decision to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves operating framework and had the effect of lowering the likelihood of future volatility in short-term funding markets.\n8\nCOVID-19 pandemic balance sheet policy\nGiven the effectiveness of the balance sheet as a monetary policy tool over the previous decade, the FOMC rapidly deployed LSAPs in March 2020 as part of its response to the pandemic.\n9\nThese purchases followed the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic at that time, and the FOMC returned the federal funds rate to its effective lower bound. Following an initial higher level of Treasury and agency MBS purchases motivated both by restoring market functioning following a period of severe stress and by providing monetary policy accommodation, the FOMC began to purchase $80 billion of Treasury securities and $40 billion of agency MBS per month. In its December 2020 post-meeting statement, the FOMC communicated that it intended to continue this pace of asset purchases \"until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.\"\n10\nBy the end of the pandemic period asset purchases, total securities held by the Federal Reserve stood at around $8.5 trillion.\nThe pace of asset purchases during the pandemic period was much greater than in the previous QE episodes. Conditions in the economy and financial system were also different than those that prevailed following the 2008 financial crisis in significant ways. The stabilizing actions taken by the Federal Reserve to restore market functioning and to support financial stability in the first half of 2020, in addition to the much higher capital levels in the banking system relative to 2008, enabled the financial system to remain resilient. Credit continued to be available to households, businesses, and local governments following the pandemic's onset.\nThe U.S. Congress and the Administration also provided extraordinary fiscal support in response to the pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u0094which included stimulus checks sent to households, expanded unemployment insurance, and the Paycheck Protection Program\u00e2\u0080\u0094that bolstered household and business balance sheets.\n11\nThe housing market\u00e2\u0080\u0094recently recovered from the buildup of poorly underwritten mortgage debt in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis and a subsequent steep decline in house prices\u00e2\u0080\u0094remained in sound condition. And as households and families sought larger living spaces and amenities as they worked from home during the pandemic, house prices increased sharply.\nIn hindsight, the sharp contrast between the economic and financial system conditions during the pandemic period and those following the 2008 financial crisis raise questions about the similarities in the response of the Federal Reserve and FOMC to these events. Was such a strong balance sheet policy response during the pandemic appropriate, and to what extent did such a strong balance sheet policy response contribute to the buildup of inflationary pressures and the post-pandemic inflation surge? Given the underlying strength in the housing market, should the FOMC have conducted such large purchases of agency MBS into late 2021? Given the strong fiscal response to support spending by households and businesses and large issuance of Treasury debt, should the FOMC have conducted such large purchases of Treasury securities into late 2021? I look forward to our conversation today and to future studies on these questions, such as those conducted regarding the effectiveness of balance sheet policies following the 2008 financial crisis.\nMy own view is that the FOMC would likely have benefited from an earlier discussion and decision to begin tapering and subsequently end asset purchases in 2021 given the signs of emerging inflationary pressures.\n12\nDoing so would have allowed the FOMC the option to have begun to tighten monetary policy earlier by raising the target range for the federal funds rate. While a robust and rapid response by the FOMC was appropriate in 2020, I think it is worth asking whether such a robust response for so long was appropriate. The economic and financial system conditions were very different during the pandemic and included a strongly accommodative fiscal backdrop.\nCould the FOMC have reduced its pace of asset purchases earlier once it was clear that market turmoil had subsided, just as the 13(3) emergency lending facilities established in 2020 were allowed to expire and exit plans developed for those programs? A thorough discussion of these questions will be a useful reference for the FOMC and other central banks as they consider future use of QE as a monetary policy tool. This perspective would be helpful for historical reference when formulating appropriate balance sheet policy as a monetary policy response to future episodes when the conventional interest rate tool is near zero.\nAnother important difference between the FOMC's balance sheet policy following the pandemic and its balance sheet policy following the 2008 financial crisis was the speed and timing of the subsequent reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve's securities holdings during the period of QT.\n13\nThis difference reflects the larger amount of securities purchases compared to the earlier periods of QE as well as the quite different economic conditions facing the FOMC at the start of QT post-pandemic. These conditions included too-high inflation and a desire by the FOMC to tighten monetary policy through both the federal funds rate and the balance sheet tools.\nSo far, the rapid and sustained pace of the Federal Reserve's securities runoff has proceeded relatively smoothly. A useful question for further inquiry is to what extent during the post-pandemic period has QT served to further tighten financial conditions. With the understanding that QT is a tool employed beyond conventional monetary policy restriction, how does one measure the incremental increase above the FOMC's concurrent increases in the target range for the federal funds rate and related forward guidance regarding its policy rate? Evidence to date suggests that QT exerts an independent effect on tightening financial conditions, though in some cases it may be asymmetric to the effects of QE.\n14\nQuantifying the effects of QT as well as QE will be helpful to policymakers in their future deliberations regarding use of the balance sheet in setting monetary policy.\nFuture Considerations regarding the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet Policy\nLooking ahead, the FOMC continues to reduce the size of its balance sheet as it seeks to maintain a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy to bring inflation back down to its 2 percent goal. Recently, the FOMC voted to slow the pace of securities runoff by around half beginning in June.\n15\nIn its Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet released in May 2022, the FOMC noted that it would eventually slow and then stop securities runoff when reserve balances are somewhat above the levels it judges to be consistent with ample reserves to ensure a smooth transition to ample-reserves levels.\n16\nAggregate reserve levels currently stand at around the levels at the start of balance sheet runoff in June 2022, and there are still sizable balances in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility. In light of these conditions, I would have supported either waiting to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff to a later point in time or implementing a more tapered slowing in the pace of runoff.\n17\nWhile it is important to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff as reserves approach ample levels, in my view we are not yet at that point, especially with still sizable take-up at the ON RRP.\n18\nIn my view, it is important to continue to reduce the size of the balance sheet to reach ample reserves as soon as possible and while the economy is still strong. Doing so will allow the Federal Reserve to more effectively and credibly use its balance sheet to respond to future economic and financial shocks.\nAs balance sheet runoff proceeds, however, it will eventually be appropriate to stop runoff as reserves near an ample level. The FOMC will be monitoring money market conditions and related interest rates as it assesses the point at which reserve levels reach ample.\n19\nIt will be important to communicate that any future changes to balance sheet runoff do not reflect a change in the FOMC's monetary policy stance. Not effectively communicating this point might cause the public to interpret the endpoint",

Waller\nAt the Reykjavik Economic Conference, Reykjavik, Iceland\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for the invitation to be here and speak to you today.\n1\nI want to step away from shorter-term questions about the economic outlook and monetary policy to delve into a subject of longer-term significance\u00e2\u0080\u0094r*. While there are many concepts of r*, I interpret it to be the real policy interest rate that is neither stimulating nor restricting economic activity with inflation anchored at the central bank's inflation target. In the short term, policymakers must judge whether a given policy setting is restrictive or otherwise, and while this judgment is made with some idea of r*, a number of factors can influence the economy in the near term so that the current setting of policy usually differs from the value of r*. At the same time, policymakers continually update their view of the appropriate value of r*. Recently, for example, discussions have focused on whether or not r* has risen, which has important implications for the conduct of monetary policy.\nFor the purposes of this discussion, I am going to be talking about the long-run, real value of r*, when inflation and employment have reached the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) goals. Because of that, an estimate of r* points toward where monetary policy is headed over the longer run. This is important for policymakers deciding the best way to get there and also for investors and other members of the public who make decisions in the near term based on their expectations of future economic conditions.\nMuch has been written on this topic, and different methods have been developed to estimate r*. My goal today is not to debate which statistical estimate of r* is best but rather describe what I believe are the economic factors behind the secular behavior of r*. In particular, I want to address two questions. First, what drove the decline in r* over the past 40 years? Second, what are the factors that may cause it to rise? I am certain some of you will disagree with my answers to these two questions, but that is the nature of good intellectual debate and how we advance our understanding of the world around us.\nOne vital fact about r* is that it is a theoretical concept without any reliable and straightforward way to determine its value. There are economic models that are used to estimate the value of r* and also surveys of market participants or policymakers such as the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections. But r* is not a precise number, unlike the unemployment rate, which can be measured directly. For these reasons, all of the model and survey estimates come with large degrees of uncertainty.\n2\nThat's why we always need to be humble in citing a numerical value for r*.\nOne thing that is evident from these different estimates, and additionally clear based on the performance of the economy at different policy settings over the past couple of decades, is that the value of r* changes over time.\n3\nThe change is slow moving, and I tend to think of it as related to the movement in factors that we can see affecting the economy over time. Though hard to precisely measure, having some understanding of the current level of r* is a matter of obvious importance for monetary policy, so I will focus today on factors that have contributed to the apparent decline in r* over the past several decades and look at how they may influence its value going forward.\nTo get some indication of how r* has evolved over time, it is helpful to look at the real, or inflation-adjusted, yield of the 10-year Treasury security, the most widely held safe and liquid asset. Let me pause here and explain why this is a good real-world proxy for the theoretical value of r*.\nThink of r* as the level of the real federal funds rate once all the cyclical ups and downs of the economy have been factored out, including near-term policy tightening or loosening that sometimes is necessary to move employment and inflation back to the FOMC's goals. Someone buying or selling a 10-year Treasury security must determine the appropriate price (or yield) by thinking about not only the near-term policy rate, but also how the policy rate will evolve over the next 10 years. Thinking about the evolution of the policy rate, most forecasts expect near-term shocks to die out and the economy to move toward the FOMC's goals, so the policy rate\u00e2\u0080\u0094absent future shocks\u00e2\u0080\u0094will move toward and eventually reach r*. This means the 10-year Treasury yield embeds a value of r*. Since 10-year Treasury securities are widely traded, their price (and yield) is reflective of current market views of the value of r*.\n4\n*\nWith that stipulated, let's look at how the real yield on the 10-year Treasury security has evolved. In\nfigure 1\n, I plot two measures. One is a series starting in the 1980s using the nominal 10-year Treasury yield and subtracting out the Michigan survey's view of expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years (the solid black line). The second measure is a market-based measure, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, which started trading in the late 1990s (the red dashed line).\nThese series clearly show a downward trend in the real yield of the 10-year Treasury over most of the period, supporting the idea that r* declined over the past 30 to 40 years. Looking at the past few years, the two series show a recent increase. This is the source of recent questions about whether r* has risen, which I will address later.\nI want to pause here and show another measure of longer-term interest rates that some people use to gauge the value of r*\u00e2\u0080\u0094the real return on capital. In my view, this is not the appropriate interest rate to use for discussing r* because it includes some measure of riskiness of business activity and is not directly related to the stance of monetary policy. As you can see in\nfigure 2\n, these accounting-based measures of the realized real return on capital, as measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (the black line) or researchers (the blue dashed line), do not show the longer-term downward trend that we saw in the real 10-year Treasury yield. Also, these values have not necessarily moved up in the recent past either. I look at these measures of the return on capital and conclude that, unlike the 10-year Treasury, there is no secular decline in the real return to capital. One could argue about how this private return is measured, but recent work, accounting for a myriad of factors, finds only modest changes in this return.\n5\nThis divergence\u00e2\u0080\u0094the longer-term decline in the real 10-year government yield until recently and the relatively flat real return on capital\u00e2\u0080\u0094holds across countries. Many researchers have documented the decline in government yields around the world, so I will not here. Meanwhile,\nfigure 3\nshows a chart from a paper by Monge-Naranjo and others where the median real return on capital (the white line) across countries has been roughly steady since 1980.\n6\nAnd, in fact, the blue region, which represents the dispersion of this return across countries, has narrowed over the years.\nTo me, these data raise a very clear question: What are the factors or events that have driven a wedge between these two rates of return, causing the real 10-year yield to decline but the return on capital to be relatively constant? And what does this say about r*?\nLet me start by discussing what is\nnot\nresponsible for this difference in yields.\n7\nFirst, it cannot be caused by longer-run trends in productivity. Trend productivity affects the real return on capital first and foremost. So even if trend productivity growth was falling over time, both rates of return would have fallen. But, clearly, the real return to capital has not fallen over time. So falling productivity growth cannot be an explanation.\nSecond, this difference in yields cannot be the result of declining population growth. Again, this would also lower the real return to capital since there are fewer workers to use productive capital, which means the existing capital stock is underutilized, thereby lowering its real return.\nSo, what drove the decline of the real return on government debt? It is obvious that what makes U.S. government debt different from the real return on capital and other interest rates is its safety and global liquidity. I will briefly discuss several factors that have influenced the supply and demand for safe, liquid assets. I will try to make the case that the demand for safe, liquid assets outgrew the supply over the past 40 years, which drove a secular increase in the price of U.S. Treasury securities and, thus, a secular decline in their real yield. At the same time, the safety and liquidity of U.S. Treasury securities was actually increasing, which made them even more attractive to global investors.\nTo be clear, I am not focusing on day-to-day movements in interest rates from idiosyncratic events that will ultimately unwind. Instead, I am thinking about factors that have long-term consequences for short-term market interest rates and, hence, r*. I will also consider how these factors may be influencing r*'s value today and in the future.\nLet me first explain why I believe the safety of U.S. Treasury securities increased over the past 40 years. By this I am not referring to default risk, which has been and will be zero. By \"safer\" I mean greater stability in the real return from holding U.S. Treasuries. I believe this occurred for two reasons. First, from 1980 to 2020 there was a significant decline in the level and volatility of U.S. inflation. Second, the Great Moderation during this period meant economic performance in the United States was less volatile, which meant less variability in the monetary policy rate. This lowered the interest rate risk from holding Treasuries. As a result, the opportunity to hold a default-free asset with less risk of inflation and economic volatility made U.S. Treasuries more attractive.\nSupport for this proposition comes from looking at the term premium on 10-year Treasuries over the past 40 years, as is shown in\nfigure 4\n. The term premium measures the compensation investors must receive to accept risk from holding Treasuries. As you can see, there is a clear secular decline in the term premium on 10-year Treasuries. I interpret this to mean that the inflation risk and real risk of holding Treasury securities made them safer to hold as time went on.\nNow let me turn to five factors that I believe played a role in causing the demand for safe, liquid assets to grow faster than the supply of these assets, pushing down Treasury yields and r*. Some of these factors are contributing to the downward trend in U.S. longer-term rates, while others affect global longer-term interest rates more broadly.\nThe first factor is the liberalization and globalization of capital markets starting in the 1990's. This increased the global demand for safe liquid assets to investors around the world who previously did not have access to U.S. Treasuries. Financial and capital markets and trade around the world were liberalized, and information technology saw advances that aided the global movement of capital, which resulted in an explosion of cross-border finance. For example, the share of external financial claims and external financial liabilities as a share of annual global gross domestic product grew from around 100 percent in 1990 to over 400 percent today. That change reflects the fact that an increasingly large share of the world's wealth is invested abroad, much of it in U.S. debt, including Treasury securities. The rise in foreign official and private purchases of Treasury securities resulted in an increase in the price of U.S. Treasury securities, driving down yields.\nThe second factor causing demand for Treasury securities to grow more than supply was the large buildup of official reserves that started after the reforms that followed the 1998 financial crisis in Asia. One consequence of removing capital controls and other financial market liberalization in other countries over the past 30 years has been to make foreign governments more vulnerable to sudden capital outflows and financial crises. Many countries have responded by building up their foreign exchange reserves to help weather such stress. Global foreign exchange reserves have increased from around $1 trillion in the early 1990s to $12 trillion today.\nNotwithstanding the drumbeat of warnings from some that the U.S. dollar is in danger of losing its primacy in global trade and finance, it remains by a very large margin the world's reserve currency. U.S. government debt, likewise, remains the primary form of low-risk asset, which is reflected in the huge stock of Treasury securities held as foreign exchange reserves around the world. The resulting demand for Treasury securities has contributed to pushing down yields and, thus, lowering r*.\nThe third factor driving prices up and yields down for Treasuries and similarly affecting r* is sovereign wealth funds. In addition to foreign exchange reserve holdings, sovereign wealth funds from some economies, especially those rich in natural resources, have become an increasingly important way for governments to invest abroad and diversify their national wealth. They are an increasingly significant force in global financial markets. Although sovereign wealth funds are diverse in their holdings, U.S. government debt is typically a sizable share of these funds. Sovereign wealth funds have grown from $1 trillion in assets in 2000 to $11 trillion last year, and a lot of those assets are presumably in U.S. Treasuries. For example, Norway's sovereign wealth fund holdings of Treasuries grew from $5.6 billion to $132.4 billion over this period.\n8\nThe growth in Treasury holdings by sovereign wealth funds has clearly contributed to the decline in Treasury yields.\nThe fourth factor that is thought to have influenced Treasury yields and r* over the past couple of decades is the aging of the population in the United States and around the world. The argument here is that as people move past their prime working years, their demand increases for safe, liquid investments that ensure their principal is preserved for their needs in retirement. U.S. Treasuries fill this need. Aging has been driven by the fact that Americans are living longer, and another big factor has been the aging of the large baby-boom generation, born between 1946 and 1964. The share of the U.S. population aged 65 or older has increased from 12 percent in 1990 to 17 percent today, which is 1 in 6 people. There is evidence that the large number of baby boomers who are retired or planning to do so soon has boosted demand for ",

Waller\nAt the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Adam, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nThe Peterson Institute is renowned for its valuable contributions to research and its influence on economic policy. There really is no better place for a central banker to come and talk about the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy. It truly is a pleasure to be here. Peterson was also the host for my first speech as a governor back in early 2021, which unfortunately, was virtual.\n2\nSo, after an eventful three years, it's nice to be back and in person.\nAfter a run of great data in the latter half of 2023, it seemed that significant progress on inflation would continue and that rate cuts were not far off. However, the first three months of 2024 threw cold water on that outlook, as data on both inflation and economic activity came in much hotter than anticipated. Initially it seemed like the bad data might be simply a \"bump\" in the road, but as the data continued to point in the wrong direction, the narrative quickly turned towards concerns that the economy was not cooling as needed to keep inflation moving down toward the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent goal. Progress on inflation appeared to have stalled and there were fears that it might even be accelerating. Suddenly, the public debate became whether monetary policy was restrictive enough and if rate hikes should be back on the table.\nBut more recent data on the economy indicate that restrictive monetary policy is helping to cool off aggregate demand and the inflation data for April suggests that progress toward 2 percent has likely resumed. Central bankers should never say never, but the data suggests that inflation isn't accelerating, and I believe that further increases in the policy rate are probably unnecessary.\nNow let me turn to the data we have seen since the last FOMC meeting. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at about a 4 percent annual pace in the second half of 2023, and that stepped down to 1.6 percent in the first quarter on this year. That looked like the kind of moderation that would support progress on inflation, but it was mostly due to two components that tend to be volatile and not reflect fundamental growth\u00e2\u0080\u0094trade in goods and services and additions to inventories. Private domestic final purchases\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is often a better signal of the underlying strength of demand in the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0094grew 3.1 percent in the first three months of this year, almost exactly the pace in the second half of 2023. I will be watching closely to see whether this measure of economic activity in the first quarter continues in the second. The Blue Chip consensus of private-sector forecasts projects real GDP growth of 2.1 percent this quarter, with only a slight moderation in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) from the first quarter. Others, like the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model, have a higher forecast.\nNevertheless, there are several reasons why I do expect some moderation in economic activity. One sign of moderation is that retail sales were flat in April and revised down in the previous two months. Retail sales are an important component of consumer spending, so this suggests that consumers may be tempering their purchases. We have also seen credit card and auto loan delinquency rates rise above their pre-pandemic levels, which indicates that some consumer segments are under stress to support their spending levels. That said, services spending data are continuing to look solid and should hold up overall spending in this quarter.\nAnother sign of moderation in the economy comes from the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) survey of purchasing managers, those who make spending and investment decisions for businesses. For the first time in four years, the indexes for surveys of both manufacturing and non-manufacturing businesses slipped below 50 in April, indicating that production in these businesses was contracting. This wasn't surprising for manufacturing businesses, since they have been reporting weakness in employment and inventories for some time. The surprise was that the survey of non-manufacturing businesses, representing the lion's share of U.S. output, fell below 50, indicating a deceleration in activity. This has not happened since December 2022. ISM results can move around from month to month, but if these numbers are sustained, it would be indicative of slowing economic activity beyond manufacturing.\nOne month does not constitute a trend, but this data suggests that policy is doing its job to moderate aggregate demand, which will support renewed progress in lowering inflation.\nNow let me speak about the labor market. The labor market is still relatively strong and supporting a solid pace of job creation, but after progress in bringing demand and supply into better balance in 2023, this rebalancing seemed to stall at the beginning of this year.\nThen in the past month or two, the easing of demand, relative to supply seems to have resumed. The hiring rate, reported by the Labor Department, slowed relative to the previous three months. In March, the share of workers who voluntarily quit their jobs declined, with the quits rate falling below pre-pandemic levels. This is a sign that fewer workers are jumping to a new and usually higher-paying job. That means firms are in less need to fill vacancies and offer relatively high starting salaries, something that could support moderating wage increases.\nJob creation fell from 315,000 in March to 175,000 in April. A big reason for the decline was a sharp drop in the pace of job creation by state and local governments that is unlikely to be repeated, but private sector job creation also fell, another indication that demand for workers continues to slow. That was also the message I take from the unemployment rate in April, which ticked up to 3.9 percent. It was the 27th consecutive month that unemployment has been below 4 percent, the longest stretch in decades, but it stands noticeably higher than the 3.4 percent rate last April. Meanwhile, the ratio of job vacancies to people looking for work fell to 1.3, just a tenth of a point above the pre-pandemic level and a sign that the relative shortage of workers related to the pandemic is close to over.\nWage growth is still a bit higher than I believe is needed to be consistent with our 2 percent target, but it's not that high and recent average hourly earnings data suggest that wage growth is moderating. And some measures of wage growth that tend to be forward-looking have also continued to slow on balance.\nJust like the data on economic activity, I see the labor market data supporting renewed progress in lowering inflation, so now let me turn to the outlook for inflation.\nLast week's report on consumer price index (CPI) inflation in April was a welcome relief after three months without progress toward 2 percent. That said, the progress was so modest that it did not change my view that I will need to see more evidence of moderating inflation before supporting any easing of monetary policy. If I were still a professor and had to assign a grade to this inflation report, it would be a C+\u00e2\u0080\u0094far from failing but not stellar either.\nHeadline CPI inflation rose 0.31 percent month over month. That barely budged the 12-month total CPI inflation reading to 3.4 percent in April from 3.5 percent in March. More importantly for the inflation outlook, core CPI inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, came in at 0.29 percent, down from 0.36 percent in March and 12-month core CPI fell to 3.6 percent from 3.8 percent.\nAccounting for price data from the report last week on the producer price index, forecasts are predicting both monthly headline and core inflation based on personal consumption expenditures, the FOMC's preferred gauge, rose a bit less than CPI last month. Most forecasts seem to be in the range of 0.23 to 0.26 percent, which is less than March's monthly increase of 0.32 percent. Although both March and April may round to 0.3 percent, it is good to see monthly inflation falling, even if it requires looking out to the second decimal point.\nLooking across these estimates, they suggest three-month annualized core PCE inflation could decline around 1 percentage point to about 3.4 percent as the outsized January increase rolls off the 3-month average. Like the CPI inflation numbers, this is not where I want to see inflation. But, after having these three-month readings accelerate in January, February, and March, I'm happy to see a reversal of this recent pattern. It leaves me hopeful that progress toward 2 percent inflation is back on track.\nBefore I say more about the implications for policy, this seems like a good moment to make a few points about a bedrock principle of monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094data dependence. The appropriate setting of monetary policy requires understanding how the economy is performing and some idea of where we think it is going. The latter typically means making a forecast or projection, based on standard macroeconomic models, of key variables and what that implies for policy. But that forecast must be validated by the incoming data. The economy is dynamic, and sometimes new or revised data can significantly change one's understanding of economic conditions and the outlook, which has implications for monetary policy. One data point alone should not change one's view of the economy, and that is why changes in one's outlook and the appropriate path for policy tend to emerge gradually and over time. While you may have confidence in your forecast, incoming data may challenge that confidence. You neither want to overreact to incoming data nor do you want to ignore it.\nI am bringing this up because I hear from some quarters the claim that the FOMC has become \"overly data dependent.\" This is a phrase that honestly doesn't make much sense to me but is apparently supposed to mean that we are over-reacting to data and allegedly sending confusing messages about the stance of monetary policy.\nI don't see how that argument applies to the views of the FOMC, if one looks at the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). Between the March SEP in 2023 and March 2024 SEP, the Committee median was relatively consistent in projecting around three rate cuts in 2024. This was in the face of some pretty dramatic shocks to the economy. There were the bank failures and wider stress in the financial system in the spring of 2023, when it was far from clear what the ultimate effects would be on the economy. There were significant fluctuations in inflation, which was hot in the first half of last year and then dramatically cooler in the second half. There was the revelation, over time and in different data, that a surge in immigration was augmenting labor supply and allowing a surge in job growth with very little upward pressure on wages and inflation. And then there were geopolitical developments, such as the threat that war in the Middle East might spread to become a wider conflict.\nAgainst this backdrop, the median FOMC participant only gradually reduced their expectation for the unemployment rate at the end of 2024 and essentially left inflation unchanged. Associated with this outlook, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate at the end of 2024 moved by at most 50 basis points between the four SEPs over 2024, and more or less held to the median of three 25 basis point rate cuts over the past year. This hardly seems like an \"overly data dependent\" Fed to me. For illustration purposes, contrast that with how the private sector reacted to developments in 2023. The implied federal funds rate based on overnight interest swap quotes for the end of 2024 see-sawed between 2 rate cuts and 10 cuts\u00e2\u0080\u0094for a few days, markets even predicted 11 cuts\u00e2\u0080\u0094and by the end of 2023 ended up implying 6 cuts.\nI make this comparison not to denigrate what markets were doing\u00e2\u0080\u0094they were simply revising their forecasts and accompanying risk outlook based on the data to maximize the value of their trading books. My point is that the approach of the FOMC is to set policy appropriately to achieve our dual mandate and typically that requires us to move gradually, extract the signal from noise from the incoming data and then adjust policy accordingly. Based on the evidence over the past year, I see nothing excessive about our data dependence when projecting the appropriate policy path.\nLet me now turn to the implications for monetary policy of my outlook for the U.S. economy. With the labor market as strong as it is, my focus remains bringing inflation down toward the FOMC's 2 percent goal. The latest CPI data was a reassuring signal that inflation is not accelerating and data on spending and the labor market suggest to me that monetary policy is at an appropriate setting to put downward pressure on inflation. While the April inflation data represents progress, the amount of progress was small, reflected in the fact that I needed to report the monthly numbers to two decimal places to show progress. The economy now seems to be evolving closer to what the Committee expected. Nevertheless, in the absence of a significant weakening in the labor market, I need to see several more months of good inflation data before I would be comfortable supporting an easing in the stance of monetary policy. What do I mean by good data? What grade do I need to give future inflation reports? I will keep that to myself for now but let's say that I look forward to the day when I don't have to go out two or three decimal places in the monthly inflation data to find the good news.\nThank you.\n1.

Jefferson\nAt the Mortgage Bankers Association\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  Secondary and Capital Markets Conference and Expo 2024  New York, New York\nShare\nThank you, Mark, for the kind introduction, and good morning to all of you.\n1\nI am happy to be here. Today, I will do three things. First, I'll share with you my current outlook for the US economy. Second, I'll discuss my thinking on the current stance of monetary policy. Third, I'll review the dynamics of housing prices which can feed into the persistence of inflation.\nMy focus on housing price dynamic stems from the role housing plays in the American economy. For most families, a home is their largest-ever purchase and their most valuable asset. Capital markets professionals in real estate finance, like you, are crucial to the smooth operation of the housing sector. Families making housing decisions rely on a healthy and productive housing finance sector.\nThe housing sector is also one of the most interest rate\u00e2\u0080\u0093sensitive sectors of the economy. As such, it's an important channel of monetary policy transmission. Understanding the various channels of monetary transmission is crucial to fulfillment of the dual mandate given to the Federal Reserve by the Congress: maximum employment and stable prices. This mandate guides my thinking about monetary policymaking.\nWith that, I'll turn to my outlook for the US economy.\nAggregate Economic Activity\nThe U.S. economy continues to grow at a solid pace. Adjusted for inflation, GDP was reported to have increased at a 1.6 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2024. That was a moderation from a 3.4 percent expansion in the fourth quarter of last year. However, private domestic final purchases\u00e2\u0080\u0094which excludes inventory investment, government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal on underlying demand\u00e2\u0080\u0094grew 3.1 percent in the first quarter. That was about as strong as the second half of 2023.\nIndeed, consumer spending has been robust over the past several quarters. Nevertheless, I expect spending growth to slow later this year as restrictive monetary policy weighs on demand, particularly on interest-sensitive spending.\nAnother reason for the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year is improving supply conditions as pandemic bottlenecks have unwound. I will be monitoring incoming data to understand better how much more help we will get from the supply side to bring inflation down further.\nThe Labor Market\nThe labor market remains solid. Monthly payroll gains slowed in April, with employers adding 175,000 jobs. Still, employers added an average of 242,000 jobs in the three months ended in April, and the unemployment rate remained below 4 percent last month.\nThe supply of workers and the demand for labor continue to come into better balance. The labor force participation rate of individuals aged 25 to 54 is now higher than before the pandemic began, as shown in\nfigure 1\n. Employers' need for workers, as measured by job openings, declined 12 percent from a year earlier, as shown in\nfigure 2\n. This rebalancing of the labor market has resulted in nominal wage growth easing even as unemployment remains historically low.\nInflation\nOf course, I have been keeping a close eye on inflation. The good news is that inflation has eased dramatically from the peak reached almost two years ago, as shown in\nfigure 3\n. However, inflation remains above the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent inflation objective.\nCore personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, rose at a faster pace over the first three months of the year than they did in the latter part of 2023. The April consumer price index and producer price index data point to a more modest increase last month. Even so, Federal Reserve staff estimate that core PCE prices rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent over the first four months of the year. That is well above the 12-month change, which we estimate at 2.75 percent. It is too early to tell whether the recent slowdown in the disinflationary process will be long lasting. The better reading for April is encouraging.\nFortunately, data on expectations suggest that the FOMC's inflation-fighting credibility remains intact. While there has been a recent uptick in Americans' inflation expectations over the next 12 months, long-term inflation expectations, over the next 10 years, remain close to pre-pandemic levels. That shows the American people believe that we will make good on our commitment to bring inflation fully back to our objective. I am acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those on fixed incomes and those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, including housing, transportation, and food. That is why my colleagues at the Fed and I are so committed to returning inflation to our target.\nMonetary Policy\nSo, what does the current state of the economy mean for the policy rate we set at the Fed? At the most recent meeting, three weeks ago, my colleagues and I on the FOMC decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. I believe that our policy rate is in restrictive territory as we continue to see the labor market come into better balance, and inflation decline although nowhere near as quickly as I would have liked. The FOMC noted that it does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In making judgements about the appropriate stance of policy rate over time, I will be carefully assessing the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\nAt its last meeting, the FOMC also decided to continue the process of reducing our balance sheet, but at a slower pace. The cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from the current $60 billion per month to $25 billion per month as of June 1. Consistent with the Committee's intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run, we're leaving the cap on agency securities redemptions unchanged at $35 billion per month. We will reinvest any proceeds in excess of this cap in Treasury securities, as detailed in the May 1, 2024 operating policy statement published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n2\nThe Housing Market\nThe Fed sets policy to promote its dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability, and employment and inflation depend on conditions in the entire economy.\nStill, given our gathering today, I thought it would be appropriate to dive a bit deeper into the housing and home finance markets.\nAs I said earlier, the housing sector is one of the most interest rate\u00e2\u0080\u0093sensitive parts of the economy. We have seen that sensitivity in mortgage rates and mortgage originations. As shown in\nfigure 4\n, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates were close to 3 percent when the federal funds rate was near the zero lower bound in 2020 and 2021. Rates surged in 2022 as the federal funds rate increased. Consistent with the increase in mortgage rates, mortgage origination volume has fallen significantly.\nThe current restrictive stance of monetary policy has weighed on the housing market. That is helping to bring supply and demand into better balance and put downward pressure on inflation\n.\nOne aspect of inflation that has gotten a fair amount of attention is housing and rental costs. This is because housing costs make up such a large share of household budgets. To calculate housing services inflation, government statistics don't use home prices because a home is partly an investment. Instead, housing services inflation is computed using monthly rents that capture what tenants pay to rent a house or apartment and what homeowners would, in theory, pay to rent their own home. The way this calculation is derived means changes in market rents\u00e2\u0080\u0094or what a new tenant pays to rent\u00e2\u0080\u0094take a long time to pass through to PCE housing services prices, as shown in\nfigure 5\n. In this figure, notice that increases in market rents, the blue and red lines, peaked in 2022, and PCE housing services inflation, the black line, lagged market rents and peaked in 2023.\nLags in Housing Services Inflation\nThe primary reason for this lag is that market rents adjust more quickly to economic conditions than what landlords charge their existing tenants. This lag suggests that the large increase in market rents during the pandemic is still being passed through to existing rents and may keep housing services inflation elevated for a while longer. This observation is important because it is an example of one of the underlying sources of lags with which monetary policy affects inflation.\nAnother factor affecting pass-through of restrictive monetary policy is that fixed-rate mortgages are common in the U.S. It is often argued that this loan structure dampens the effect of monetary policy.\nFigure 6\nshows that the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is about 7 percent, while the average outstanding mortgage rate is about 4 percent. This lower outstanding mortgage rate is due to households who locked in rates during lower-interest periods, including when the Fed cut the target range for the federal funds rate to near zero shortly after the pandemic took hold. Fixed-rate mortgages do dampen the effect of monetary policy, but, according to recent research, not as much as previously thought.\n3\nThere is a delay between when mortgage rates go up and when household mortgage payments go up, as shown in\nfigure 7\n. Board staff research documents that mortgage payments go up over time because many households continue to refinance their mortgage or move. Despite higher rates, households in the U.S. borrowed over $1.5 trillion in new mortgage loans in 2023. These borrowers include first-time homebuyers, existing homeowners moving between homes, and homeowners obtaining cash-out refinances. The payment they owe on that recently obtained mortgage is higher than it would have been had lower rates been maintained, and their consumption may be correspondingly lower. The cumulative effect of a higher interest rate on aggregate mortgage payments grows over time as more new loans are originated at the higher rate. The staff's research documents that, historically, borrowers like these who are not deterred by higher rates are responsible for a little over half of the pass-through of interest rates to mortgage payments.\nConclusion\nIn closing, let me reiterate why we care about housing. The housing sector is where many households have made, or will make, their largest investment. Therefore, the prices that families pay for that housing can affect their overall well-being. The work you do to make housing accessible is an important part of the economy.\nThe housing sector is also a key part of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. That is one reason why policymakers will continue to pay close attention to this vital sector. Of course, no one sector dictates monetary policy. We look at the totality of the data to set policy and achieve the objectives given to the Fed by Congress: maximum employment and price stability. Considering the lagged effects of monetary policy, I am encouraged that over the past two years, we have made good progress toward our dual-mandate objectives.\nThank you for your time and attention today.\n1.

Waller\nAt the Third Conference on the International Roles of the U.S. Dollar, hosted by the Federal Reserve Board, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nAccessible Keys for Video\n[Space Bar]\ntoggles play/pause;\n[Right/Left Arrows]\nseeks the video forwards and back (5 sec );\n[Up/Down Arrows]\nincrease/decrease volume;\n[M]\ntoggles mute on/off;\n[F]\ntoggles fullscreen on/off (Except IE 11);\nThe\n[Tab]\nkey may be used in combination with the\n[Enter/Return]\nkey to navigate and activate control buttons, such as caption on/off.\nThank you, Beth Anne, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nI would like to welcome everyone to this Third Conference on the International Roles of the U.S. Dollar, which is jointly organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve Board.\nWhen people talk about the \"dollar,\" they are referring to a number of roles it plays on the world stage\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a physical currency used worldwide, financial assets denominated or redeemable in U.S. dollars, or a settlement unit used in transactions. In all of these, the role of the U.S. dollar in global finance and its economic and financial stability implications are of elementary importance to Federal Reserve. Participants in the first and second installments of this conference discussed the different roles the dollar plays in the global economy and how the primacy of the dollar benefits not only the United States but also the rest of the world. U.S. households, for instance, benefit from lower transaction and borrowing costs, while U.S. businesses and the U.S. government benefit from deep financial markets, including a large pool of creditors and investors. Households and businesses in foreign economies also benefit from access to this broad pool of lenders and investors, which reduces their financing costs and fosters global economic growth.\nDespite all the benefits the dollar provides the United States and global economies and the efforts to mitigate some of the financial stability challenges posed by its dominant role, there has, for some time, been commentary predicting that the dollar is destined for demise\u00e2\u0080\u0094potentially an imminent demise. Such predictions have not materialized.\n2\nThe dollar remains, by far, the most widely used currency across a variety of metrics, including as a store of value and a medium of exchange. However, the role of the United States in the world economy is changing, and finance is always changing, so I think it is important for policymakers to regularly consider if and why the dollar's role might change as well.\nThis conference is a good venue to discuss some of the challenges and opportunities for the international use of the dollar in this ever-changing financial landscape. For instance, one of those challenges is the complex relationship between the dollar and geoeconomics, commonly defined as the interplay between economic and geopolitical tools and objectives. Rising geopolitical tensions, sanctions against Russia, China's efforts to bolster usage of the renminbi, and economic fragmentation all can affect the international use of the dollar, most visibly as a store of value and reflected in its use in official foreign exchange reserves.\nThese same factors can also affect the dollar's role as a medium of exchange, such as in its use in trade invoicing, global banking, international debt issuance, and foreign exchange transactions. These topics will be addressed by two of our presenters today. Linda Goldberg will present a paper addressing the effects of geoeconomic tensions, focusing on the dollar's use in official foreign exchange reserves. Linda and her coauthors find that financial sanctions and geopolitical distance from the United States are associated with lower dollar shares in foreign exchange reserves. Looking more broadly, Ryan Chahrour will present work exploring the potential effects of escalating conflict and protectionism on the dollar's dominance in connection with efforts to promote the use of other currencies such as the renminbi. He and his coauthors find that both sanctions and policies that directly support the international role of the renminbi may reduce the prominence of the dollar if these sanctions and policies are long-lasting.\nThe shifting cross-border payments landscape\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the rapid growth of digital currencies\u00e2\u0080\u0094could also pose challenges to the dominant role of the U.S. dollar. Angelo Ranaldo will provide an overview of aspects of that payments landscape, focusing on the world's largest multicurrency cash settlement system for foreign exchange, the Continuous Linked Settlement payment system, and its role in facilitating cross-border payments by reducing settlement risk. In the panel moderated by Michelle Neal this afternoon, the panelists will take a broader look at the current landscape of cross-border payment systems and how new technologies such as central bank digital currencies and faster transactions could potentially affect U.S. dollar usage and global capital flows. Stijn Claessens, in his keynote address, will expand on similar themes and pose questions that still need to be explored by researchers engaged on this topic.\nWhile recognizing that the U.S. dollar may face some challenges to its dominance in the future, we, as policymakers, are also attuned to the potential financial stability challenges that the current broad use of the U.S. dollar can pose for financial systems in the United States and the rest of the world. For example, past experiences show that foreign shocks can transmit to the United States when investors and governments seek a safe haven to protect the value of their assets in periods of stress. Such a \"flight to the dollar\" means that dollars are in especially high demand in funding markets around the globe during these episodes, as we saw during the Global Financial Crisis and the financial turmoil at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve supports the use of dollars internationally through our liquidity facilities, including the central bank liquidity swap lines, which provide foreign central banks with the capacity to deliver U.S. dollar funding to institutions in their jurisdictions. Scott Davis and Moritz Lenel will discuss the effectiveness of these swap lines in their respective papers. Using different approaches, they find that the availability of U.S. dollars through central bank swap lines mitigates the appreciation of the dollar with respect to other currencies in episodes of stress and reduces deviations from covered interest rate parity. This evidence suggests that the central bank swap lines not only ensure that credit continues to flow to U.S. households and businesses, but also that these swap lines have effects that enhance financial stability and, thus, the standing of the U.S. dollar as the dominant global currency.\nIn closing, I would like to reiterate the importance of understanding how changes in the global landscape may affect the central role of the dollar in the global economy and financial system. I also want to thank you for taking the time to join the discussion over the next two days. This conference brings together world-class researchers, practitioners, and policymakers dedicated to understanding and addressing these important topics.\n1.

Barr\nAt Central Banking in the Post-Pandemic Financial System 28th Annual Financial Markets Conference, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Fernandina Beach, Florida\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for inviting me to speak today. As many of you know, I have two roles at the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u0080\u0094my role as a governor of the Board and member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), where I participate in developing and setting monetary policy, and my role as the Vice Chair for Supervision, where I oversee our supervision and regulation of the banking sector. In keeping with the interdisciplinary spirit of this conference, I'll touch upon these different roles, and how they both promote a healthy economy.\nTo start, I will share a couple of observations about the current stance of monetary policy. Then, I'll discuss the conceptual framework that underpins the key components of prudential bank regulations.\n1\nAs part of this discussion, I will also offer some observations about adjustments to our regulatory framework that we are exploring, including as a result of lessons learned from the bank stress in the spring of 2023.\nCurrent Stance of Monetary Policy\nStarting with recent economic developments, I see the performance of our economy as strong. Labor demand is being met with rising supply from both improved labor force participation and immigration. We have solid growth and low unemployment. The unemployment rate has been below 4 percent for 27 months, the longest stretch of unemployment that low in more than 50 years.\nI am strongly committed to meeting the mandate that Congress has given us to achieve maximum employment and price stability. We are doing very well on the employment component of our mandate, and we have also made tremendous progress over the past two years on the inflation component. Inflation has fallen from its peak of 7.1 percent to 2.7 percent today. But we are not yet all the way to our target of 2 percent. As noted in the FOMC's statement following our meeting earlier this month, inflation readings in the first quarter of this year were disappointing. These results did not provide me with the increased confidence that I was hoping to find to support easing monetary policy by reducing the federal funds rate. This means that we will need to allow our restrictive policy some further time to continue to do its work. I think we are in a good position to hold steady and closely watch how conditions evolve. I remain vigilant to the risks to achieving both components of our mandate. I believe that the current approach is a prudent way to manage those risks.\nEvaluating risks is also fundamental to my other role as Vice Chair for Supervision. In the same way that the public depends on monetary policy to support a healthy economy, the public also depends on a strong and stable financial system, so I would like a spend the remainder of my time discussing the prudential regulatory framework the Fed uses to oversee banks and promote financial stability.\nConceptual Framework Underpinning Our Regulatory Structure\nThe prudential regulatory framework for the banking system is crucial to supporting an economy that works for everyone. As I have spoken about many times before, banks play a critical role in the economy in taking deposits and providing credit to households and businesses, but distress in the banking system can impose widespread costs on society. The government and taxpayers support the banking system through deposit insurance and other forms of government support. The system relies on banks having the capacity to remain resilient and continue lending to households and businesses through times of stress.\nI will focus on three key components that underlie the resilience of the banking system: capital, liquidity, and resolution resources. Each component plays a distinct role in fostering a safe and stable banking system by promoting the resilience of banks and limiting the impact of their distress or failure on the broader economy. The three elements work together: capital absorbs the impact of unanticipated losses; liquidity enables a bank to meet funding withdrawals and provides time to right itself from a bout of stress; and resolution resources facilitate an orderly wind down of a failing bank, which promotes financial stability and limits damage to the economy.\nCapital is a core source of resilience, and common equity is the core of capital. Common equity provides the greatest degree of loss absorbency, and it is the first line of defense against the risk of bank runs. Sufficient capital makes a bank resilient both to cyclical economic downturns and unexpected shocks like we saw in March 2023. Capital can absorb losses no matter the source, so it is an effective defense against a wide range of risks that banks face. We use different models to set capital requirements because no one approach can fully capture the range of risks. These models include a leverage ratio, static risk-based capital rules, and a forward-looking stress test.\nLiquidity regulation complements capital regulation by ensuring that a bank has adequate resources to meet potential outflows. Liquidity can also support an orderly resolution. Requiring banks to hold high-quality liquid assets that are commensurate with the size and likelihood of sudden funding outflows is a form of self-insurance against unanticipated funding shocks. While no amount of liquidity can fully guarantee that a bank will survive a run, in combination with ample capital, liquidity resources can help stabilize an individual bank and limit the potential for stress to spread.\n2\nA third element of the prudential regulatory structure that I will describe is resolution resources, in the form of long-term debt and resolution planning. Unlike the other elements of the regulatory structure that enable banks to manage through stressful times and continue operating, long-term debt requirements in the United States are intended to provide resources that can be drawn down in the resolution of a failed bank. In concert with requirements that large banks develop \"living wills,\" or strategies for orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure, long-term debt provides loss-absorption resources\nafter\na bank fails, which can be used to capitalize a bridge bank, provide time for an orderly bidding process, or for the preparation for sale of the failed bank's assets and liabilities. Moreover, long-term debt can reduce the likelihood of a run by increasing market confidence that there will be sufficient resources for an orderly wind down.\nThese three elements of our regulatory regime are tiered so that larger firms that pose a greater risk to financial stability are subject to stronger requirements. This tiering runs through all of our regulation and supervision and reflects the diversity of banks that support our economy. For example, a small community bank is subject only to a simple leverage capital ratio and no liquidity or resolution requirements, consistent with its small systemic footprint. On the other hand, a global systemically important bank (G-SIB)\u00e2\u0080\u0094the largest and most complex bank\u00e2\u0080\u0094is subject to multiple measures of capital adequacy, long-term debt requirements, and liquidity rules.\nPeriodic Adjustments\nPrudential regulation was substantially enhanced after the global financial crisis, providing the foundation for a strong, stable, and prosperous U.S. banking system. Capital regulation was thoroughly redesigned, and the Federal Reserve now conducts an annual stress test of large banks. Quantitative liquidity requirements were put in place and have greatly strengthened the liquidity positions of large banks. Capital, liquidity, long-term debt, and resolution planning have reduced the likelihood that banks experience distress and have limited the harm that the distress or failure of one of the largest, most systemically important banks would do to the U.S. economy.\nBut the work to reform capital requirements after the global financial crisis is not done yet. The Basel endgame proposal represents the final step in addressing the regulatory weaknesses revealed by that crisis. It is targeted at ensuring that the risk weights that underpin the capital regime accurately measure a bank's risks. The Federal Reserve has received a large number of comments on the proposal, and we are focused on carefully working through those comments. We also undertook a special data collection from large banks to better estimate the impact of the rule on banks' capital requirements. I expect we will make broad and material changes to the proposal on the basis of the comments we received.\nBasel endgame will finish the work of responding to the global financial crisis, but the financial system is dynamic and continues to evolve. Regulators must ensure that the rules adequately keep pace with these developments.\nThe Events Last Spring\nLast spring, the distress and failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank, and First Republic imparted important lessons about the functioning of all three parts of the regulatory framework. SVB was a highly vulnerable bank, and its vulnerabilities left the bank exposed to the specific combination of rising interest rates and slowing activity in the technology sector that materialized in 2022 and early 2023. Once the public appreciated the bank's risks, the bank was viewed as insolvent. SVB faced a run of uninsured depositors that was unprecedented in its speed and severity.\n3\nThere were signs of distress at other banking organizations, particularly those with a heavy reliance on uninsured deposits. Signature Bank experienced a deposit run that resulted in the bank's failure that same weekend.\n4\nFirst Republic also had significant unrealized losses on loans and securities, and it failed a few months later.\n5\nDepositors at these banks withdrew funding at rates that greatly exceeded the assumptions made in our current, standardized liquidity requirements, although these firms weren't even subject to those requirements.\nIn addition to facing historically fast deposit outflows, SVB and Signature Bank faced impediments to monetizing their assets, including even highly liquid assets. This was especially true for securities that had lost value and if sold would require the firm to recognize those losses. Securities can be monetized through repo markets, but firms may be limited by their counterparty relationships in these markets and the typical tendency of counterparties to reduce exposures when there are signs of stress. Both SVB and Signature Bank learned about these limitations the hard way.\n6\nOf course, there is one source of liquidity that solvent banks can rely on to provide funding against a broad range of assets: the Federal Reserve's discount window. Yet while the discount window can be an important source of liquidity, firms need to be prepared to access it.\nUltimately, SVB and Signature Bank were resolved after the Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) recommended to the Treasury Department that it invoke the systemic risk exception, allowing the FDIC to guarantee these banks' deposits. The systemic risk exception is an extraordinary tool that is rarely used; its two prior uses since its creation in 1991 occurred during the global financial crisis.\n7\nThe Federal Reserve also used its emergency authorities, together with a backstop from the Treasury Department, to establish the Bank Term Funding Program. These actions were able to limit the contagion in the banking sector. However, additional regional banks still saw deposit outflows and came under stress. We're working to address the lessons learned from these events in three areas.\nCapital\nOn capital, I've already mentioned our Basel 3 endgame proposal and its role in completing the post global financial crisis regulatory reform agenda. With respect to the acute problems we saw last year, the proposal would also extend the requirement to reflect the impact of unrealized losses on capital to all large banks. Currently, only the largest banks are required to reflect those losses on their capital. This would better reflect interest rate risk in capital, a problem that played a major role in both SVB's and First Republic's failures.\nLiquidity\nTo address the lessons about liquidity learned last spring, we are exploring targeted adjustments to our current liquidity framework.\n8\nOver the last year, many firms have taken steps to improve their liquidity resilience, and the regulatory adjustments we are considering would ensure that all large banks maintain better liquidity risk management practices going forward.\n9\nThey would also complement the capital requirements by improving banks' ability to respond to funding shocks.\nFirst, we are exploring a requirement that banks over a certain size maintain a minimum amount of readily available liquidity with a pool of reserves and pre-positioned collateral at the discount window, based on a fraction of their uninsured deposits. Uninsured deposits often represent cash needed to meet near-term needs\u00e2\u0080\u0094like paying bills or making payroll\u00e2\u0080\u0094and we have seen depositors act quickly to withdraw these funds if their availability is in doubt. It is vital that uninsured depositors have confidence that their funds will be readily available, if needed, and this confidence would be enhanced by a requirement that large banks have readily available liquidity to meet requests for these deposits.\nIncorporating the discount window into a readiness requirement would also re-emphasize that supervisors and examiners view use of the discount window as appropriate and unexceptional under both normal and stressed market conditions. Given the important role of the discount window, we're also actively working to improve its functionality. As part of these efforts, we are seeking feedback from banks, and this feedback will help us to further prioritize operational improvements.\nSecond, we are considering a restriction on the extent of reliance on held to maturity (HTM) assets in large banks' liquidity buffers, such as those held under the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the internal liquidity stress test (ILST) requirements, to address the known challenges with their monetization in stress conditions.\n10\nThird, we are reviewing the treatment of a handful of types of deposits in the current liquidity framework. Observed deposit withdrawals from high-net-worth individuals and companies associated with venture capital or crypto-asset-related businesses suggest the need to re-calibrate deposit outflow assumptions in our rules for these types of depositors. As we saw during the stress of a year a",

I am very sorry that circumstances prevent me from joining you in person.\nI will start by acknowledging the parents, spouses, partners, other family members and mentors who are here. Without your support, sacrifice, and encouragement, we would not have so much to celebrate today.\nAnd to the class of 2024\u00e2\u0080\u0094congratulations on earning your law degree. You are the most selective class in Georgetown history, chosen from 14,000 applicants, and the most well qualified as well. Among you are Fulbright scholars, military veterans, Peace Corps, AmeriCorps and Teach for America alumni, student athletes, accomplished musicians and even a medical doctor. An impressive group. This is also the most diverse class in the 154-year history of the school.\nI am especially proud today to say that there is a lot of Georgetown in my family tree. My father graduated from the College in 1943 before serving in the U.S. Army in World War II. After the war, he received his law degree here and practiced law in Washington, D.C. I am fortunate to have two wonderful daughters; one graduated from the College in 2012; the other is a member of the Class of 2026 at the Law Center.\nIt seems like yesterday that I was in your shoes, receiving my degree, looking forward with optimism and excitement, and wondering what lay ahead.\nI cannot help but think fondly of my time here. For many years, friends from law school have gathered annually for a weekend to refresh our ties and laugh about times gone by. These gatherings are referred to as \"Big Chill,\" a reference to a 1983 movie that revolved around a mid-life reunion of college friends. I made lifelong friendships here that I keep to this day, and I hope it will be the same for you.\nAlong with all the hard work, I also remember the fun. A favorite tradition was to attend Saturday midnight showings of\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show\nat the Key Theater on Wisconsin Avenue in Georgetown.\nNow, if you have led a culturally deprived life and are tragically unfamiliar with the movie, it is a raucous musical starring a young Tim Curry. Everyone in the theater would sing along, shout out the lines, and throw popcorn at the screen; many would dress up like the characters. Now, I didn't dress up\u00e2\u0080\u0094sorry to disappoint you\u00e2\u0080\u0094but no party was complete until all of us danced \"The Time Warp\" to the movie's famous song.\nAs it happens, I still remember the steps, and I had intended to demonstrate the Time Warp for you, but that will not be possible today.\nInstead, I will offer a few thoughts that I might have benefited from hearing when I was sitting in your chairs a mere 45 years ago.\nEmbracing Change\nThe years since my graduation have brought waves of fundamental change to the workplace and to society at large, much of it driven by technology. Imagine a world with no internet, no email or texting, no personal computers or cell phones, no social media. Some of you parents are no doubt thinking: I would be fine with that world!\nThe pace of change will likely continue to be very fast. Be alert to the ways your working life may change. Think about how you can be prepared for those changes and to turn them to your advantage, and to society's advantage. The practice of law has been transformed over the years; if you do choose the path of a practicing lawyer, I would think about what practicing law could look like in 10 or 20 years.\nIn a world that will continue to evolve quickly and in unexpected ways, you will need to be agile. Embracing change and taking risks can be an important part of your development as a professional and as a person. Your formal education may end today, but you are not done learning. Many of the important things you will need to know can only be learned through experience. And experience can be a hard but irreplaceable teacher.\nAs an example, near the end of my second year here, it was time to select the next editor in chief of the\nGeorgetown Law Journal\n. I thought that there were plenty of colleagues who were better qualified, but who simply did not want the job. So, with much trepidation, I put my name in. I was secretly, but utterly, terrified that I might be chosen. And amazingly enough, I was. What now?\nIt turned out that, as I feared, I was not well prepared for that responsibility. I had to keep people interested and motivated enough to work on the\nJournal\nwhen many things competed for their attention. I had to have a plan for the organization and not just for myself. I had to do this while exhibiting confidence that I did not feel. My main memory of that time is thinking, \"This is harder and far different from what I had expected!\"\nWhat I now know is that almost no one is ready for their first leadership roles. When you step into a leadership role, it is very common to doubt yourself. If I could tell my younger self something, it would be to believe in yourself and put yourself in situations in which you will be seriously challenged to do new things. Assume that you will make mistakes. Learn from those mistakes; do not dwell excessively upon them in regret. You will fall down. Get up. Repeat cycle.\nThe more you do that, the more you will learn and the faster you will develop as a person and as a leader. Know also that, in my experience, there is no single model of a successful leader. Each of you has it in you to lead successfully.\nNo One Path\nOne of the great things about your legal education is it sets you up for success on a wide variety of potential paths. I left the practice of law a few years after I left this school. But my legal education has benefited me all along the way. Studying law teaches you to think clearly, analyze thoroughly, and understand all sides of an argument. The possibilities that lie ahead of you are extremely broad. You may work for a single law firm for your entire career. Or you may leave the law fairly soon, as I did, and never look back. You will always benefit from what you learned here.\nThe fact is, I do keep a copy of the Federal Reserve Act that I consult often.\nLike many of you, I imagine, I knew that I wanted to do public service. As I left law school, I remember thinking about people like George Shultz and Cyrus Vance, prominent figures of the day who had successful private-sector careers and served periodically in government.\nThe head of the investment bank in New York where I worked as a young man was Nicholas F. Brady, who had an extraordinary career in investment banking and had served as a U.S. senator from New Jersey as well. I was the most junior of employees, but I wanted to introduce myself and tell him about my own aspirations. But approaching him was daunting. Maybe he would decline to meet with me. Maybe he would think I was not committed to the firm if I told him I was interested in public service.\nI finally summoned the courage to present myself at his office. I told him that I grew up in Washington, had been a federal law clerk and a congressional staffer, and wanted to do public service along the way. I said that if you need someone to staff you on anything you do in Washington, I'm your guy. He said something along the lines of, \"Great, thanks.\" I then crept back down the stairs to my broom closet of an office wondering whether that was going to matter.\nA few months later, I got a call from his secretary. I can still hear her gravelly voice. \"Can you come up and see Mr. Brady?\" When I got there, he said, \"I need you to help me out with this thing.\" This thing was defending an oil company from a hostile takeover attempt by a colorful corporate raider of that era named T. Boone Pickens. I ended up spending months going back and forth from New York to Washington with Nick. A few years later, Nick Brady became the Treasury Secretary. Nick asked me to join him at Treasury, which opened the door for me to higher levels of public service. The point is this: if I had not forced myself to get up from my desk, taken the stairs up to the 15th\u00a0floor, and presented myself to his office that day, the rest of my life would have been very different, and I would not be standing here today.\nMustering that little bit of initiative changed my life. A little initiative can make all the difference in anyone's career.\nConclusion\nI will conclude by encouraging you to think beyond yourselves. Each of you has the capability to achieve success in any field you choose; it is important that you also consider how to give back and use your gifts to make a difference. Reflect on the motto of this school: \"law is but the means; justice is the end.\" Many of you have served at law clinics where you stood up for underrepresented individuals and organizations. And many of you will play important roles in the military, at nonprofits, and in governments around the world.\nEach generation has an obligation to move us closer to the ideal, as embodied by the famous image of blindfolded Lady Justice holding the scales. You should count yourselves among the luckiest in all our society to graduate from this institution, to have the support of loved ones through three grueling years, and the health and other good fortune not to get tripped up along the way. Several years ago, one of my predecessors, Ben Bernanke, said, \"Those who are the luckiest . . . also have the greatest responsibility to work hard, to contribute to the betterment of the world, and to share their luck with others.\" I cannot improve upon that.\nI thank you for having me. Georgetown will always hold a special place in my heart. Thank you again to Dean Treanor and all the faculty, and the hardiest of congratulations to the Class of 2024.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            May 19, 2024",

Kugler\nAt the 2024 Diploma Ceremony, Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia\nShare\nThank you for your generous introduction, Dean Solomon, and thank you for the invitation to be here and share this special day with all of you. Let me begin by congratulating the Class of 2024. Let's give a huge round of applause to our graduates, who are all so deserving of being recognized. And let's clap our hands together and also congratulate the families and friends who are here, too, because\u00e2\u0080\u0094believe me, I know\u00e2\u0080\u0094it takes a village! So let's thank all those who supported you along the way and who made sure you had what you needed to make it here today. I want to acknowledge that this is a real milestone. You have all accomplished so much already as you now embark on a career in public policy and leadership. And you are now joining the many Batten graduates who have made great contributions in careers in the service of others.\nI suppose I am here, at least in part, because I represent the promise and the possibility of a career spent in large part in public-policy-related work. I work in that city that many of you possibly hope to work in\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am told that nearly half of master's degree students and more than one-fourth of bachelor's degree students graduating from the Batten School end up in Washington, D.C. In various roles, I have been fortunate enough to do some of the kind of policy work that many of you have set your sights on. I understand that a sizable share of Batten students indeed end up working in government but also in think tanks, in nonprofits, and in the private sector. Some of you have worked in Washington already or done internships there, and many of you will go forth from here and travel the well-worn path of Routes 29 and 66, avoiding rush hour if you can and finding two like-minded classmates so you can use the express lanes, too.\nSome of you probably came to the University of Virginia (UVA) and Batten knowing exactly what you wanted to do, with a clear view of the path to get there. Some of you probably settled on that goal and that path over the course of your studies. Certainly, higher education is a big investment, and everyone needs a plan for recouping that investment\u00e2\u0080\u0094in terms of income, of course, but also in terms of opening other opportunities that education can provide. As a professor of public policy at Georgetown, I always hoped to provide tools that would be useful for graduating students in their new jobs. And I do know, given the caliber of Batten, that your studies here have helped you to not only attain the tools and knowledge you will need moving forward but also to make the contacts and build the networks that will help you in your careers. Most importantly, I hope that your time at UVA has opened your eyes to opportunities that you hadn't even imagined when you first set foot on Grounds. Importantly, I do hope that you have learned over your time here about the many ways in which public policy work can be fulfilling for you personally and can also allow you to improve the lives of others, whether pursuing work on housing affordability, budget priorities, or access to health and education; building infrastructure capacity; or tackling financial stability. Ultimately, public policy and leadership are about helping people.\nIt is with that latter point in mind that I am going to tell you about my own experience and the importance of allowing yourself to take risks and follow your own path as you pursue a career in public service. While this may contradict some of the advice you have received about managing your careers, I strongly believe that it will make you more successful and more fulfilled in the long run.\nI tell you this because I am probably an unlikely person to have been appointed to the Federal Reserve Board, as the first Latin policymaker in the Fed's history. I was raised in Colombia and came to the United States at age 15, speaking almost no English. I attended public schools. In high school, I carried around to every class one of those thick Merriam-Webster dictionaries because, of course, back then there was no Google Translate on smartphones, and also no smartphones!\nAnother thing I carried with me, along with my dictionary, was the memory from my childhood of traveling around Colombia with my parents and witnessing great poverty and the suffering and social problems that come from poverty. At an early age, my brother and I would accompany my parents to shantytowns around Bogota to help with social projects, and we traveled the countryside to visit my maternal grandparents, who lived in one of the poorest states in the country. I would spend my summer with my grandparents since both my parents worked. My grandfather, who had to leave high school as a teenager to help his widowed mother raise his five siblings, would take us to his dairy farm at four o'clock in the morning to help milk the cows and put the milk in stainless steel tanks. Traveling the unpaved roads into town, we would then stop at various stores to sell the milk. But my grandpa's day was just getting started, because he was also the mayor of his town, and every morning, he would open his office and deal with the business of being mayor. While my grandpa never graduated from high school, he was an autodidact, and he worked hard to put all his siblings and his six children through college, and he saw serving as mayor as a way to help his neighbors. The memories of my grandfather overcoming many obstacles but also devoting his life to helping others were certainly an inspiration and remain a source of motivation for me even today. In fact, I remember going back to visit my grandparents over the years, summer after summer, and seeing the new roads that had been paved and the improved school and health clinic in the town and seeing how a life devoted to public service can improve lives.\nSo when going to college, while not totally definite about what to study, I found that the memories from my childhood and the desire to find ways to address poverty guided my decision to gravitate toward economics and political science, and I figured the best path for me was to work in public policy. In particular, I discovered that economics was a science that would allow me to better combine my interest in math with my desire to help address poverty, so I moved in that direction, pursuing a PhD.\nI want to emphasize that my career was not linear or perfectly planned, but rather I have chosen to take detours. And, importantly, I have chosen to take risks along the way. Yet what was always a constant was my commitment to use my technical expertise to tackle poverty and social challenges. But I also could have never imagined that some of the detours I took would actually help me down the road in preparing me for my current role.\nAs an undergrad, I decided to apply out of the blue for an internship with the junior senator from Maryland at the time, Senator Barbara Mikulski, only because I read a newspaper article about her work in the Senate as the daughter of Polish immigrants, which really resonated with me. Little did I know that I was going to be back at the Hart building a few decades later, making the rounds to meet with various senators as I prepared for my Senate confirmation for the Federal Reserve. In grad school, I spent time as a visitor both at the Brookings Institution and at the San Francisco Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0094where I worked on my PhD research while surrounded by policy-focused professionals. Stepping into these institutions pushed me out of my comfort zone and into the world of policy and discussions about what it took to prepare for Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings while I was a grad student immersed in a highly technical PhD. program. Little did I know that I was going to be back at the Fed attending those FOMC meetings myself and at Brookings just a few months ago giving my first speech as a governor. I know as students, many of you have already done internships and searched for these opportunities around policymaking, and I want to tell you that this is exactly what will make you grow moving forward. Like me, you may someday be surprised to find yourself revisiting those important places where you once studied and learned, but now as a senior professional in a position to provide service in a very different way.\nFor decades, I spent much of my career in academia pursuing answers to my big questions on poverty by doing research and teaching at universities. Throughout, I always focused on those same questions that drove me to study economics in the first place\u00e2\u0080\u0094and always with my sights on the role of policy and the implications for real people, like my grandpa and others I had seen in Colombia and in the United States, who lacked opportunities. And that's when my next big detour came. Just one year after being recruited by Georgetown, I was approached by the U.S. Department of Labor to be its chief economist. While I knew I could contribute my knowledge in the middle of the Great Recession about the drivers of unemployment and effective policies to create jobs, I had never spent time working in government. This certainly pushed me out of my comfort zone again, and I am very glad it did, because I learned a great deal about how policy actually gets made while using my expertise and knowledge to conduct evidence-based policymaking. Little did I know that the data on prices and employment produced by the Labor Department would be the same data that I analyze in my current role at the Fed, looking for evidence-based insights to make policy that benefits all Americans.\nMy point with all this biography is to show how the crucial professional experiences in my life have come from keeping my options open, being open to new opportunities, and taking risks. It is reassuring, and very tempting, to set one's sights on one and only one goal and to stay strictly focused on the path to get there. Any map will show the most direct route from Charlottesville to Washington\u00e2\u0080\u0094just take a right turn at Gainesville, right? But there are other destinations, and other ways to get where you are going, that may make the journey more enriching and rewarding. Be open to those possibilities. Be ready to try new things. One of the things you may gain from this approach is discovering talents and abilities that you may not know you had. To invoke a principle of economics, trying new things and considering new possibilities may help you discover your comparative advantage. Discovering a comparative advantage in this way is really just about learning more about yourself, a more general goal for life that I would recommend to everyone. And you may be surprised at how often the winding road brings you back to old landmarks you may have previously visited, but now with a stronger set of tools for providing service.\nAs I said earlier, this approach to your career planning might contradict some very good advice from your professors and advisers, and maybe from your own parents, on how best to use the great advantage of your education at the Batten School. By encouraging you to step off the path now and then to consider other possibilities, I don't mean you shouldn't work as hard as possible to achieve your goals. Absolutely you should put your heart and soul into what you do, hopefully because you will find a job to which you are deeply committed and you love.\nMy own career so far has followed a winding road. It is certainly not what I expected when I was sitting where you are sitting today. But I'm glad I said yes, took some chances, and experienced different kinds of jobs in different types of organizations. Keep a lookout for opportunities and consider saying yes even if doing so might move you off your planned path for a time. You may discover strengths and abilities you didn't recognize before. You may develop interests and even passions that you never expected to develop. Changing the world might begin with a change of perspective that helps you better understand the realities around you and also yourself. Be open to all that. Congratulations, again, to the Class of 2024, and the best of luck wherever the road takes you. And if that is the Fed, please do make sure to pop in to say hi!\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            May 18, 2024",

Bowman\nAt the Pennsylvania Bankers Association 2024 Convention, Nashville, Tennessee\nShare\nI would like to thank the Pennsylvania Bankers Association for the invitation to join you today.\n1\nI appreciate the opportunity to engage with you on matters that affect the banking industry. Before sharing my thoughts about the current bank regulatory environment, I will discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy.\nUpdate on the Economy and Monetary Policy Outlook\nOver the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our meeting earlier this month, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings, but at a slower pace beginning in June.\nAfter seeing considerable progress on slowing inflation last year, we have not yet seen further progress this year. The 12-month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation have moved roughly sideways since December and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in March. With average core consumer price index (CPI) inflation this year through April running at an annualized rate of 4.3 percent, well above average inflation in the second half of last year, I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time.\nThe recent pickup seems to be evident across many goods and services categories, suggesting that inflation was temporarily lower in the latter half of last year. Prices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which is weighing on consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation throughout this episode.\nEconomic activity increased at a strong pace last year but may have moderated early this year. First-quarter gross domestic product growth was temporarily dampened by volatile categories, like inventories and net exports, and over the past few months, including recent data revisions, consumers appear to have pulled-back on goods spending through April. Still, consumer services spending has remained strong, and residential activity and business investment in equipment and intangibles strengthened.\nSo far this year, payroll employment has increased at a strong pace through April, partly reflecting increased immigrant labor supply. Although we have seen signs that the labor market is coming into better balance, progress has slowed. Recent employment reports continue to show a tight labor market, and the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent, with the number of job openings relative to unemployed workers still above its pre-pandemic level. Throughout last year, the average pace of job gains slowed, and the labor force participation rate rose, but in recent months, job growth has rebounded. Labor force participation flattened out around last year's peak, which suggests no further improvement in labor supply along this margin, as labor force participation among those aged 55 and older has been persistently low.\nAt its current setting, our monetary policy stance appears to be restrictive, and I will continue to monitor the incoming data to assess whether monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our target. As I've noted recently, my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook.\nFirst, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in part to immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unclear whether further supply-side improvements will continue to lower inflation. Geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains, putting additional upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices. There is also the risk that the loosening in financial conditions since late last year and additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate.\nFinally, there is a risk that strong consumer demand for services, increased immigration, and continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation. Given the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize. Wage growth has remained at an elevated rate of about 4 to 5 percent, still higher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal given trend productivity growth.\nIn light of these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the current state of the economy and predicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.\nBank Regulatory Reform\nTurning to the bank regulatory reform agenda, there has been a significant volume of matters that have recently been completed, that have been proposed, and that are in the pipeline. A number of these efforts have been met with criticism and public resistance, from informal comments and ad campaigns to formal legal challenges, including litigation challenging the validity of these reforms. Reasonable minds can disagree on the appropriate path forward for bank regulatory policy, but the current period of regulatory reform feels more contentious than in the past.\nThe current regulatory agenda is notable for its broad scope, both for the institutions that would be subject to reforms, and the nature of the reforms. The proposals touch on a wide range of topics that directly or indirectly impact banks of all sizes. And they often represent significant shifts in regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations. My remarks today highlight two themes related to the significant number of regulatory changes and proposals under consideration.\nFirst, the volume and scope of revisions affect a wide range of banking activities and pose significant challenges for all bankers. Reviewing, understanding, and then implementing these reforms will involve bank management, compliance, legal, audit, and even frontline staff. At the same time, banks must also balance the existing and ongoing compliance obligations to meet supervisory expectations. Compliance has always been an important bank function, and it often involves a shared responsibility and obligation across many different business lines and personnel. Simply keeping up with the thousands of pages of new regulatory reforms poses a significant challenge, especially for banks with small staffs and a single compliance officer.\nThose same staff members, with already heavy compliance responsibilities, are also often best positioned to provide feedback on pending regulatory proposals. Banker comments shared as part of the administrative rulemaking process help inform and influence proposals that are under consideration. If there is a desire to influence change, stakeholders must engage and provide input during this process.\nSecond, the large number of finalized, proposed, and potential changes suggest a lack of prioritization\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether we have effectively identified actual risks to the banking system and devoted resources to the most pressing of these issues. Prioritization is something I have spoken about at length in the past, and it remains just as critical today.\n2\nThe banking stress last spring revealed the presence of flaws and shortcomings in our bank regulatory and supervisory framework. A lack of prioritization in our approach risks losing focus on making substantively responsive adjustments and reforms.\nOpportunities for Engagement\nReviewing and commenting on regulatory proposals should never be a distraction from a banker's core responsibility to ensure the bank continues serving its customers in a safe and sound manner, and in compliance with applicable laws. So, I do not want any of you to take my remarks today as a call to drop everything you are doing and open up the\nFederal Register\nand start reading. The banking system is a highly regulated environment, and as you see in your work every day, requires banks to devote significant resources to compliance. A strong culture of compliance can help keep your bank safe, and in the aggregate promotes a safe and sound banking system. Within a bank, virtually everyone has a role to play in promoting that culture of compliance with applicable law, all while serving your customers.\nBut stakeholders, including bankers, have an important role in the stewardship of the banking system that goes beyond compliance\u00e2\u0080\u0094namely, participating in the administrative rulemaking process. It is critical that you share your views with policymakers on regulatory reform proposals. All the comments, data, and analysis from commenters enable policymakers to make informed decisions throughout the rulemaking process, from the initial brainstorming stage, through the creation of a proposal, and in crafting a final rule.\nThis feedback is equally critical in understanding how the supervisory process is working as it evolves over time and incorporates new standards and expectations. Information about the intended and unintended impacts of reform initiatives is especially informative. Often, private-sector stakeholders are best positioned to understand and explain these impacts, and to identify gaps in the context, data, and analysis underpinning these initiatives.\nI recognize that in some instances, multiple, interrelated proposals out for comment at the same time complicate or even frustrate the ability to provide meaningful feedback. For example, the federal banking regulators have proposed significant reforms to capital requirements, while also proposing new long-term debt requirements for banks with over $100 billion in assets. While these efforts are on their face distinct, the calibration of such requirements are directly linked. The calibration of capital requirements is used to set long-term debt requirements. Therefore, these proposals present challenges not only to regulators, but also to public commenters trying to understand the potential and complete impact of reforms. Even so, I strongly encourage your participation to inform the rulemaking process.\nI will share my views on a few of these proposals, but I certainly do not mean to suggest that this list is exhaustive. All the proposals could benefit from public feedback.\nBank Mergers and Acquisitions\nSome prudential regulators and other policymakers are currently reconsidering the approach to the review and approval of bank mergers and acquisitions (M&A).\n3\nM&A transactions allow banks to evolve and thrive in our dynamic banking system and can promote the long-term health and viability of banks. M&A also ensures that banks have a meaningful path to transitioning bank ownership. The absence of a viable M&A framework increases the potential for additional risks, including limited opportunities for succession planning, especially in smaller or rural communities when zombie banks continue to exist but have no competitive viability or exit strategy.\nThe impact of a more restrictive M&A framework affects institutions of all sizes, including larger institutions that are vying to compete with the very largest global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). They may choose to pursue M&A to remain competitive with larger peers who can achieve that growth organically through their sheer scale.\nM&A is an important part of a healthy banking system. So, when considering changes to the framework, I think we need to first identify the problem that needs to be solved, and then ask whether any proposed solution is fair, transparent, and consistent with applicable statutes. And critically, whether the proposed solution has the potential to damage the long-term viability of the banking system.\nAre there identified shortcomings in the current process or standards, and are the proposed reforms targeted and effective to address these shortcomings? One argument I have heard about the M&A regulatory approval process is that the lack of application\ndenials\ndemonstrates that regulators are failing to meaningfully review and pressure test proposals and have effectively become a rubber stamp. I think this argument lacks a strong foundation. There is ample evidence that undermines this argument, including the resource demands on institutions of pursuing M&A activity, and the protracted time it takes to complete the regulatory review and approval process (and the not insignificant failure rate we see represented in withdrawn applications).\nFirst, we have to acknowledge that choosing the path of a merger or acquisition is not undertaken lightly. These transactions require significant upfront and ongoing investment and commitment of resources. At the outset, this includes finding an appropriate acquisition target, conducting due diligence, and negotiating the terms of the transaction. Once a target is identified, the banks must prepare appropriate regulatory filings, engage with regulators during the application process, and prepare for post-approval business processes including scheduling necessary and costly systems conversions and customer transition. This is an expensive and reputationally risky process that bankers and their boards of directors take extremely seriously.\nSecond, one would expect to see different patterns emerging if regulators were truly acting as a \"rubber stamp\" for banking applications.

Waller\nAt the International Organization for Standardization Technical Committee 68 Financial Services 44th Plenary Meeting, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Minneapolis, Minnesota\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, President Kashkari, for the introduction, and thank you to the conference participants for the opportunity to speak with you.\n1\nAs you all know, the payment system relies on the kind of cooperation and collaboration that this body represents. So, let's begin by acknowledging that ongoing effort.\nFrom its founding, the Federal Reserve has played a central role in payments. We seek to foster a payment and settlement system that is safe and efficient. Such a system promotes a vibrant economy, since it allows for participation from a broad range of individuals and businesses without requiring them to invest heavily in bilateral arrangements. Technical standards are the common language used by payment system participants like businesses, financial institutions, payment system operators, and payment service providers. Technical standards can help contribute to payment system safety and efficiency, benefitting the full range of participants. Technical standards for payments are in no way new\u00e2\u0080\u0094we have had them in place for decades, and those standards make it more efficient to process a check, access cash at an ATM, and carry out other functions less visible to consumers but essential to the payment system. As payments technology advances at a rapid pace, technical standards must also evolve. And they must do so in a way that supports innovation while promoting safety, efficiency, and interoperability among a growing number of payments products and technologies. Today I will share some perspectives on technical standards, particularly in the context of evolving payments technology.\nEverything Old Is New Again\nBut before getting to that, I would like to provide some historical context since the benefits of standardization within an evolving payment system predate this current wave of innovation.\nLet's start with some early examples from U.S. payments history. The free-banking era from 1837 to 1863 experienced significant fragmentation and corresponding frictions in the payment system as competing banknotes circulated across different geographical regions, requiring costly and inefficient trading of various forms of currency and featuring high levels of fraud and counterfeiting.\n2\nLater, during the national banking era from 1863 to 1913, checks were becoming a predominant form of payment at the same time that the population of the United States was moving westward, requiring a nationwide method to clear checks. The check clearing infrastructure at the time, however, was regional, creating a patchwork network reliant on correspondent banks to move and clear checks across regions, often at high cost and with long delays. Congress created the Federal Reserve in 1913 and assigned the Fed a number of key roles including issuance of Federal Reserve Notes and, in short order, establishment of a national check-clearing network. These are examples that predate electronic payments where standardization improved the efficiency of payments.\nWe can also call on examples where we have seen rapid changes in the technology of payments, and technical standards supported innovation by providing a common language for systems to communicate with each other. Immediately after 9/11, planes were grounded, and check payments, which were still largely paper-based, could not be processed.\n3\nThis highlighted inefficiency in the clearing of paper checks. In response, Congress passed the Check 21 Act, which enabled banks to process check information electronically using digital images of an original check. The Check 21 Act created a framework for the substitute check to be provided under generally applicable industry standards and also served as a bridge until industry acceptance of fully electronic checks became ubiquitous.\n4\nElectronic check processing at such scale necessitated common check image exchange standards, which were developed and adopted through industry and Fed collaboration.\nAnd, as I mentioned earlier, the payment system once again is experiencing a technology-driven revolution.\n5\nShifting consumer preferences and new technologies have led to new financial products and services. This includes the introduction of instant payments, advances in digital wallets and mobile payment apps, and the emergence and growth of digital assets. Innovators see an opportunity for enhancements in payments, whether through the introduction of new capabilities or finding ways to alleviate frictions such as speed, cost, and accessibility.\nWhile the potential benefits of these advances are significant, disjointed or incompatible innovations could increase fragmentation in the payment system or exacerbate frictions at different points of the payment chain. Will platforms that use newer technologies, for example, be able to talk with one another and traditional payment rails, or will they lead to siloed, parallel networks\u00e2\u0080\u0094so-called \"walled gardens\"?\nSupporting compatibility or interoperability is important because payment systems are similar to other networks in that greater participation in the network usually means greater value for its users. The network effects in turn can drive a more vibrant economy, since a well-functioning payment system can promote commerce across a broader range of consumers and businesses. While achieving goals like network scale and interoperability is a complex problem, technical standards are one part of the solution to support consistent communication among existing and emerging technologies.\nPerspectives on Technical Standards\nA technical standard is simply a common specification or guideline. For example: when I drive across the country, I do not need to worry about whether pumps at different gas stations will fit my gas tank. That is because there is an agreed-upon standard. Or, in the example of payments, financial institutions adopt messaging standards to allow systems and networks to communicate with one another.\nIf done well, the development and adoption of technical standards can help increase efficiency across payment chains and promote consistency in how disparate systems communicate. This requires standards that are technically sound, implemented consistently, and timed correctly to meet a market need.\nTechnical standards\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as those developed within the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)\u00e2\u0080\u0094are voluntary, open, and consensus-based. The collective market can identify frictions where standards would be beneficial, and then individual firms can choose whether and when to adopt them based on perceived benefit. The process to develop the standards is open and transparent, and it requires consensus at every step. This process establishes standards that are seen as credible and legitimate.\nConsiderations and Lessons Learned\nIt is important to note that simply having a standard in place will not automatically translate to economic benefits. To achieve network effects, standards must be widely adopted. Developing\nconsensus-based\nstandards implies that all relevant participants are at the table and advocating for their interests, which is not a given, but is critical if standards are to be widely adopted. Timing is also important. In the early stages of technological advances, standards should not be overly prescriptive to stifle innovation and should be flexible and adaptable as the market changes. Conversely, waiting too long to adopt a technical standard could lead to inefficiencies and high costs to comply after the fact.\nStandards also need to be implemented consistently, which requires industry coordination to align on common practices. Building on previous lessons learned, the ISO 20022 messaging standard was developed to be a common standard for multiple payment rails, with a structured data format, and aims to align messages across payment systems. Nonetheless, there has been variation in ISO 20022 implementation, and further industry coordination over time will be necessary to align on common practices.\nAll of this\u00e2\u0080\u0094identifying the need and timing for standards, incorporating a breadth of industry perspectives, and aligning on implementation approaches\u00e2\u0080\u0094requires an immense amount of coordination. And much of this coordination must take place among competitors. So often a neutral convener is needed to achieve better outcomes. That is why we have standard development organizations like ISO to provide a forum where participants from the private sector, academia, and the public sector can contribute expertise and collectively shape standards in a way that meets business and public sector objectives, providing some comfort that the needs of all market participants and consumers will be considered.\nThe Federal Reserve and Payments Technical Standards\nThat brings me to the Federal Reserve's roles in this process\u00e2\u0080\u0094not role but\nroles\n. One such role is to serve as a convenor, with this week's conference being a typical example. Among standards development organizations, like the Accredited Standards Committee X9 domestically and ISO internationally, the Fed is known for impartial facilitation of efforts to work toward a common goal.\nIn another role, the Federal Reserve leverages its expertise as a payment system operator to inform future standards and broader improvements in the payment system. For example, in 2015, the Fed issued a call to action in its paper, \"Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System,\" asking stakeholders to come together in pursuit of a better payment system for the future. The paper, and subsequent work, highlighted the role of standards to enhance payments security and efficiency at various points in the payment and ancillary processing flows, noting the importance of supporting industry efforts to develop and adopt standards, as well as common approaches to implementation.\n6\nThe Federal Reserve itself adopts standards in its role as a payment system operator. For example, the FedNow Service, which went live in July 2023, was built using the ISO 20022 messaging standard. Incorporating this standard enables a number of operational efficiencies, including improved information exchange between financial institutions, support for straight-through processing, and reduction in errors and the need for manual processing steps. We have also committed to adopting the ISO 20022 messaging standard for the Federal Reserve's wholesale payments service, the Fedwire Funds Service, by March 2025. We expect this adoption will improve the speed of wholesale cross-border payments by reducing operational costs and promoting consistent communication across global platforms. The richer data in ISO 20022 could also improve anti-money laundering and sanctions screening and support broader adoption of extended remittance information.\nIn serving as a neutral convenor, providing payments expertise, and improving payments in our role as a payment system operator, the Fed extends its long history of engaging in the development of payments technical standards.\nConclusion\nAs we navigate the latest wave of technological innovation in payments, the fundamental payment system dynamics and role of technical standards are not new. However, the pace of change is a lot faster now than in the 1910s, when paper checks were used. Collaboration among a broad range of private and public stakeholders can help to establish standards for integrating the new technologies into the payment system.\nAdvocating for an open and transparent standards development process, where participants adopt standards that are technically sound and supportive of business and public objectives, is one way the Federal Reserve can help to foster payment system safety and efficiency, as well as support responsible innovation at its present rapid clip.\n1.

Bowman\nAt The Digital Chamber DC Blockchain Summit 2024, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nI would like to thank the Digital Chamber for the invitation to share my perspectives on innovation in the financial system.\n1\nI welcome opportunities like this to engage in discussions that include both the public and private sector on this important topic. These conversations help inform my understanding of and expectations for how technology can enhance financial services in a manner that is consistent with operating in the highly regulated banking industry. Today, I will share my views on evolving financial technology and the importance of ongoing, responsible innovation, including the roles of both the public and private sectors in shaping the future.\nIn my role at the Federal Reserve, I view financial innovation through the lens of the central bank's responsibilities\u00e2\u0080\u0094issuing U.S. currency; conducting monetary policy; fostering a safe and efficient payment system; maintaining financial stability; promoting consumer protection; and supervising and regulating financial institutions. Regulators often espouse the benefits of innovation\u00e2\u0080\u0094innovation can lead to greater efficiency, and it can promote competition in the market, which can lower the cost and expand the availability of products and services to consumers and businesses.\nWhile regulators acknowledge these benefits, innovation is inevitably accompanied by risk. Innovation can exacerbate traditional financial risks or introduce new risks that must be carefully understood and managed. And on a basic level, the \"newness\" of innovation often leads regulators to reflexively resist these changes, whether the change takes the form of new technology, new ways of delivering products and services, new financial infrastructure that underlies how the banking system works, and new relationships within the financial system and beyond.\nSo how do regulators get comfortable with innovation? Some attending today may answer that \"they don't!\" And I am sure that some here in the room have experienced this friction in trying to pursue innovation in a heavily regulated environment. In fairness, sometimes \"no\" is the correct regulatory response when innovation either does not solve an actual problem, or simply cannot be executed in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws. But my goal today is to propose some building blocks that could help regulators get to \"yes\" more often, and potentially smooth the rough path to successful innovation in the banking system.\nUnderstanding Innovation\nAs a first principle, I would offer \"understanding\" as a necessary predicate to promoting innovation. Before we craft a useful public policy around innovation in banking, we need to understand the various dynamics involved with particular innovations. We must consider how innovation can impact different financial sectors, from small banks to wholesale financial markets, and how those impacts will ultimately effect end users. For example, will \"tokenized\" products and platforms duplicate existing bank deposits and payment rails, potentially creating parallel systems? If so, will the products and platforms that duplicate these functions provide the same legal protections for customers and the overall financial system?\nThe wide variety of technology and use cases can be a significant obstacle to getting to a place where regulators understand any one innovation. Innovation in the financial system can take many forms including new technology, new business models, and improvements to existing infrastructures. As one form of innovation, distributed ledger technology (DLT), including blockchain, has inspired new ways of thinking about the exchange of assets and data, in addition to the role of intermediaries and trusted third parties. DLT combines a number of different design elements\u00e2\u0080\u0094like distributed data storage, cryptography, and consensus mechanisms\u00e2\u0080\u0094that support the transfer process, information visibility, and transaction recordkeeping.\n2\nDLT is an interesting example because it highlights the challenges presented to regulators in understanding innovation. There are many variations in the application of DLT\u00e2\u0080\u0094and ongoing research and development creating more variability over time\u00e2\u0080\u0094which ultimately may complicate understanding how the technology can be used, and how different functionality can be incorporated into DLT solutions for different use cases.\nIn short, innovation can take many forms. It often involves new uses for existing technology that enhance core business lines, but it can also include the introduction of transformational new technology or capabilities. Customer demands for cheaper products or for new and innovative products often motivate banks to explore how technology and innovation can meet these demands and provide products and services for the future.\nWhile understanding technology is an important first step, it is not the only one. Regulators also need to understand the players who operate in the fintech space. Banks of all sizes have a long history of innovation, from the introduction of checks; to the advent of ATMs that allow easy access to cash and basic banking information; to online banking platforms and electronic payments that have simplified and streamlined the way many consumers and businesses manage and access their funds, receive credit, and conduct financial transactions. Innovation helps banks upgrade their existing business lines to better meet customer needs, for example, by introducing instant payments or providing credit in innovative ways.\nThere are also many nonbank providers in this space, including core service providers that often hold the \"keys\" to innovation at small banks when they facilitate the add-on of new technology to core systems. And fintechs that may focus on even more transformational uses of technology within all aspects of banking. This presents another layer of complication when it comes to innovation in banking.\nEven with an understanding of technology and of the players involved, regulators still need additional feedback to understand the \"why\" of innovation. What is the purpose of the innovation? What problem is it designed to solve? Are there tradeoffs policymakers would need to consider if the new technology were introduced or integrated in the existing financial system?\nThere are many examples across this spectrum of innovation. For example, take the use cases around DLT. Some banks are exploring the possibility of DLT as a way to help facilitate services like cross-border payments and financial market transactions. Other businesses may see DLT as a way to improve supply chain management by tying payments to specific activities across the supply chain. Some financial institutions see DLT as a potential solution for existing processes that require manual interventions and coordination across disparate systems. Businesses may look at a single technology\u00e2\u0080\u0094DLT\u00e2\u0080\u0094and see possible solutions to a wide range of problems. When the financial system promotes innovation, we better enable firms to serve their customers' unique needs while also advancing the capability of the financial system.\nRegulators and industry both have an important role to play in achieving this goal of understanding. Regulators cannot hope to craft effective public policy without understanding. And while industry's focus is rightly on developing innovative solutions, part of successful innovation in the banking space is promoting education and understanding for the regulators.\nOpenness to Innovation: Getting to \"Yes\"\nAs a second principle, regulatory openness is a critical ingredient to fostering innovation in the financial system. The first reaction of regulators to proposed innovation in the banking system is often not one of openness and acceptance, but rather suspicion and concern. The use of emerging technology and innovation may require a change in policy or supervisory approach. It also very often requires regulatory feedback\u00e2\u0080\u0094sometimes before innovation is introduced, in others after it has been rolled out and is reviewed during the supervisory process.\nAs a financial policymaker and a regulator, I recognize that there are a number of questions we must answer before pursuing a change in policy, whether in the form of regulation, or in supervisory approach, to facilitate innovation in the financial system.\nRegulators need to ask whether we have considered the intended and unintended outcomes of a new innovation, and do the benefits of the new technology outweigh the risks? Would the introduction of a new technology or innovation in the banking system require updating our regulatory framework to incorporate clear oversight? Who should have responsibility for oversight, and what roles do we see for different regulators at both the state and federal level?\nTransformational technology requires clear, consistent, and transparent guardrails and expectations to govern the activities that are allowed into the regulated financial system. Where current regulation does not contemplate a new activity, should it be acceptable for financial agencies to regulate the activity through supervision and enforcement alone? Or should congressional action address the treatment of these activities in the financial system?\nThese are difficult questions, to be sure, but ones we must confront if we are to allow innovation to flourish in the banking system and the broader financial system. Ensuring an orderly and observable method for regulators to understand and provide a path for potentially disruptive or transformational technology could ultimately enhance the long-term stability of the financial system.\nSo, while the obligation to\npromote understanding\nmay fall more heavily on industry, the obligation to\nbe receptive to innovation\nfalls more heavily on regulators. We must fight the temptation to say \"no\" and resist new technology, and instead focus on solutions\u00e2\u0080\u0094how can we mitigate the risk of new technology? What benefits will technology bring to the financial system? How can we provide clear regulatory expectations?\nThe appeal of resisting innovation\u00e2\u0080\u0094resisting change\u00e2\u0080\u0094is that it preserves the familiar and known. But the cost of resistance to change may be great, in that it promotes stagnation and inertia. Ultimately, this could lead to a banking system that may be safer and smaller, but also less effective at providing banking products and services and in supporting the U.S. economy.\nInnovation as a Priority in Banking\nUnderstanding and openness can go a long way to promoting innovation, but I think there are opportunities to do more. Can we shift from a reactive approach to innovation, to an active one that facilitates innovation? This leads to my final principle, which is that regulators can do more to promote innovation. Regulators can do more than simply tolerate innovation, they can promote it through transparency and open communication. Take, for example, the frictions associated with cross border payments, including the speed and cost and the ability to transfer money. At first blush, this seems like a prime opportunity for innovation to come in with a new approach.\nThe challenge in cross-border payments historically has been achieving the goal of serving new types of customers and increasing the speed of payments, without losing or watering down important compliance safeguards that deter criminal activity. Some perceived payment frictions exist for specific policy reasons and do not stem from issues with existing technology. Therefore, new technology alone cannot solve the issue unless it also addresses the required safeguards.\nRegulators can serve a valuable role in identifying where a technology solution may have an important \"gap,\" as in the case of cross-border payments, by identifying how a solution can meet the needs of both customers and regulators. Innovation and regulatory and legal requirements can coexist\u00e2\u0080\u0094providing both enhanced capability and regulatory compliance. Transparency can promote innovation.\nPolicymakers should strive to define a clear and sensible regulatory framework designed to meet policy objectives that also enables the private sector to innovate within the established guardrails. A clear regulatory framework supports private sector innovators by providing clarity and consistency that encourages long term business investment in pursing innovation, while continuing to support today's products and services. A regulatory framework empowers supervisors to focus on safety and soundness and ensuring a safe and efficient payment system.\nIn the past, I have described an approach to innovation that solves specific problems and enables banks and other providers to meet the needs of their customers in a safe and sound manner.\n3\nThis approach recognizes the role of the private sector and focuses policymakers on payment and financial system infrastructure while balancing the public policy objectives with the benefits provided. In this construct, the same activities that present the same risks must be subject to the same regulatory expectations\u00e2\u0080\u0094regardless of what the product is called or where it is offered.\nThe active promotion of innovation has proven to be successful in the past. One example from 2019 highlights the benefits of this approach, specifically as it relates to the use of alternative data to support small dollar consumer loans.\n4\nTimely guidance and regulatory clarity in the interagency statement clarified that, with a customer's consent, a bank may use alternative data, like checking account balance activity to help evaluate the potential borrower's creditworthiness who might not have otherwise qualified for a loan. This example did not require a change in technology, instead it used data in a responsible and innovative way through leveraging deposit account cashflow information to show credit worthiness, enabling banks to meet their customers' credit needs.\nI think there is more we could do on this front. For example, I think there are opportunities for regulators to provide clear, actionable, and timely feedback on innovation proposals. And the principles I have described are complementary\u00e2\u0080\u0094the more regulators understand innovation, the more comfortable they will be in accepting it and promoting its adoption in the financial system. My hope is that the Federal Reserve's ongoing research and engagement with industry will help us continue to understand and assess the potential benefits and risks presented by new innovation.\nClosing thoughts\nAs I consider the ever-evolving financial landscape, I will continue think about how the regulatory framework can accommodate new technology and services, whi",

Cook\nAt the Expanding Access to Capital for CDFIs event, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, New York\nShare\nThank you, Jack. And thank you to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for hosting this timely event. It is good to be back at the New York Fed where I conducted research on financial institutions as a dissertation fellow over two decades ago.\nYour recent research on the Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) industry is a welcome prelude to today's conversation. A lot of thoughtful, interesting research is also being produced by other Reserve Banks on this topic, some of which I will highlight today.\nLet me start by saying it is a great honor for me to be among those doing this important work every day. You help to encourage and strengthen the financially and economically vulnerable, and to create economic opportunity that benefits them and our broader economy. CDFIs are a subject I know something about, and care about a great deal. I personally know the impact these financial institutions have in communities, having previously served on the board of Rende Progress Capital, a CDFI in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nIt is also wonderful to see that many more Americans are becoming aware of CDFIs. A CDFI in Arkansas, People Trust, was featured in the 2023 short film \"The Barber of Little Rock.\" That documentary was nominated for an Oscar at this year's Academy Awards. In the film, the founder talks about how the People Trust name is inspired by potential borrowers, some of whom had been turned away by other institutions and want to prove they are trustworthy, creditworthy, and able to run successful businesses. It is exciting to see the stories of CDFIs reaching new audiences in such an auspicious way.\nCDFIs are having a moment off the silver screen, too. A significant portion of the federal funding directed to community development activities during the height of the pandemic flowed through CDFIs. These investments exemplify how CDFIs can meet increased demand while managing rapid growth through expanded capitalization.\n1\nAddressing the funding needs of CDFIs has also helped to elevate awareness of the critical services these institutions provide.\nToday, I will speak about the crucial role CDFIs play in their communities, the challenges they face in a rapidly changing landscape, the innovations they are adopting to overcome these challenges, and the support the Federal Reserve gives to this important industry.\nWhy Are CDFIs Important?\nAs all of you in the room know, CDFIs represent a range of institution types, including banks, credit unions, loan funds, and venture capital funds. They provide loans to entrepreneurs to start or expand businesses, families to purchase their first homes, healthy food retailers to operate in food deserts, community health centers to service low-income communities, and they also support many other community and economic development activities.\nTermed by some as \"financial first responders,\" CDFIs have the creativity, mission, and funding structures to respond to needs through customized products and services for the people and communities they serve. CDFIs are a critical source of financing for organizations working on the front lines of community development. They reach households, individuals, businesses, and civic organizations that might otherwise be underserved\u00e2\u0080\u0094as compared with the level of attention, favorable terms, and assistance offered by CDFIs\u00e2\u0080\u0094or even unserved by traditional financial institutions. In the current interest rate environment, where financial institutions have generally tightened credit, CDFIs are especially important for those borrowers who benefit from the flexible underwriting and terms they offer.\nThese institutions also provide other important services that complement their loan offerings. For example, they often require clients to participate in assistance programming, such as credit counseling, homeownership counseling, or business coaching, before receiving loans. As a result, many of these institutions serve as financial literacy educators, and provide support for new entrepreneurs. CDFIs often continue their work with borrowers even after loans are made, for example, by helping them through rough spots, should borrowers experience difficulty repaying loans. They leverage their relationships to help their borrowers grow and thrive. These capacity-building efforts and technical support were particularly important during and immediately following the pandemic, when there was a historic surge in new businesses formed in the U.S.\nWhen speaking about CDFIs, it is essential to highlight whom they serve and where they work. CDFIs frequently work with historically underserved populations and communities. Roughly 20 percent of CDFIs are headquartered in counties with persistently high poverty rates, and 40 percent are located in communities of color.\n2\nFor example, research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas indicates that mission-driven financial institutions, including CDFIs, provided more Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to borrowers in low- and moderate-income communities and majority-minority communities than their traditional counterparts.\n3\nGrowth in Demand for CDFI Products and Services\nTherefore, it is encouraging to see that the industry is growing both in terms of number of certified CDFIs and total assets held. From 2018 to the start of 2023, the number of certified CDFIs rose 40 percent and assets have nearly tripled, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n4\nInterest in CDFI products and services also continues to grow. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's 2023 CDFI Survey indicates that nearly three-quarters of CDFI respondents experienced an increase in demand for their products from 2022 to 2023.\n5\nCDFIs are especially adept at leveraging capital\u00e2\u0080\u0094with some programs leveraging $8 in private-sector investment for every $1 of public funding.\n6\nThat leverage helps meet this growing demand.\nDespite growth in demand, many CDFIs still face challenges in today's economic environment, especially as it relates to meeting the needs of the communities they serve. I emphasize that the communities CDFIs serve are ones that were disproportionately impacted by business and school closures as well as negative health outcomes resulting from the pandemic. They also have been among the most affected by recent inflation. I would like to highlight three specific issues that CDFIs are struggling with, as identified by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's CDFI survey.\nFirst, demand is outpacing the supply of capital. While there has been an influx of federal funding for CDFIs, much of that is tied to pandemic-related relief programs and other programs with specific purposes. Therefore, building out long-term sources of capital is a continuing challenge. One hopeful strategy is selling loans on secondary markets. New research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that CDFIs sell billions of dollars of loans each year but tend not to do so systematically. Also, residential mortgage loans account for almost all the volume sold by CDFIs. As such, there is likely substantial room for growth.\n7\nLater in today's program, you will hear more about opportunities for CDFIs to explore options, such as pooling and securitizing loans to expand their access to capital markets as well as further developing the secondary market for loans backed by other collateral types aside from residential mortgages.\nSecond, the increasing cost of lending capital makes extending affordable credit to their low- and moderate-income borrowers more difficult.\nThird, CDFIs are not immune to the challenges associated with hiring and retaining staff, and managing labor costs, that are faced by many employers in a tight job market.\nHow the Federal Reserve System Supports CDFIs\nThe Board and regional Reserve Banks have long understood the unique value of CDFIs. CDFIs are key partners to our Reserve Bank Community Development programs and integral members of our Board and Reserve Bank Community Development Advisory Councils. We rely on the insights they share with us to understand how low- and moderate-income communities are faring in the economy.\nThe Fed also supports CDFIs through certain supervisory and regulatory activities, including through evaluation of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Among other provisions, the CRA allows banks to receive CRA credit for undertaking community development activities in cooperation with CDFIs.\nAs mentioned, CDFIs were key providers of PPP funding in low- and moderate-income communities during the pandemic. The Federal Reserve's PPP Liquidity Facility created more opportunities for banks and CDFIs to leverage funding in our most vulnerable communities impacted by the pandemic.\n8\nIn addition, the Fed clarified the capital treatment of funds made available through the Emergency Capital Investment Program, and provided technical assistance throughout the application process.\nAnother key area of the Federal Reserve's support for CDFIs is research, which is an area of interest for several of the Reserve Banks. In particular, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the stellar research efforts of our host, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, related to the growth of the CDFI industry and the origination and sale of loans by CDFIs. The latter was the impetus for today's event. I hope this research will facilitate more conversations and serve as a resource for the industry as CDFIs and those who support them consider how to increase liquidity to meet demand.\nAnd of course, gatherings like today's event are another component of our role in supporting CDFIs: Bringing together thought leaders to share information and ideas with the goal of advancing the work of CDFIs.\nConclusion\nIn closing, the CDFI industry has been a critical source of responsive, flexible capital and technical assistance for people and places most in need. Recent investment in CDFIs positions the industry to leverage new capital to deliver a greater impact in the communities they serve. I am pleased to see the meaningful work the CDFI industry has accomplished and eager to see the creative innovation and impactful outcomes of the CDFI industry. And in my role here at the Federal Reserve, I am proud of the many ways the entire System has supported the timely and important work of CDFIs. I look forward to continuing this vital partnership.\nThank you.\n1.

Jefferson\nAt \u00e2\u0080\u009cCentral Bank Communications: Theory and Practice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio\nShare\nWatch Live\nIntroduction\nThank you, Ed, for the kind introduction and for the opportunity to speak.\n1\nYou and the organizers of this conference have put together an excellent program on a very important topic, central bank communication, which is key for effective transmission of monetary policy to the economy. To fulfill our dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability, it is vital that we make good monetary policy decisions and that we communicate those decisions to the public effectively.\nToday, I'll do three things. First, I'll discuss the channels that the Federal Reserve currently relies on in its communications with the public. Second, I'll offer a few historical examples of how economic thinking on monetary policy communication has evolved over time. Along the way, I'll highlight how President Mester has contributed to this evolution. And, finally, I'll share some thoughts on the communication challenges that policymakers face.\nCurrent Federal Reserve Communication Channels\nCurrently, Fed policymakers communicate often. The Fed publishes a statement after every Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, FOMC minutes three weeks following each meeting, a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) four times a year, and monetary policy, financial stability, and supervision and regulation reports twice a year. The Chair holds a press conference after every FOMC meeting and testifies in front of Congress on the\nMonetary Policy Report\ntwice a year. Other written communications from the Board and the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, as well as policymakers' speeches, interviews, and other appearances, help inform the public about the Fed's goals and its strategies to achieve those goals.\nCommunication isn't only about talking, it's about listening also. Listening is reflected in our activities. In addition to listening to the steady beat of economic data, the Board and the Reserve Banks conduct numerous surveys of financial market participants, businesses, and families. Some of what we hear is summarized in the Beige Book published eight times a year. And the Fed has many forms of community outreach, including\nFed Listens\nevents where Fed policymakers go into local communities to hear directly from people living and working there. Alternatively, sometimes representatives from communities come to us. For example, earlier this year, I heard from a rancher, a manufacturing consultant, and the head of a nursing school at one of these events.\nToday, it's widely accepted that clear communication contributes greatly to the effective transmission of monetary policy, especially because clear communication can affect the expected path of interest rates and financial conditions more generally. Loretta, in one of her speeches, describes very well the role of central bank communication: \"The public will have a better understanding of monetary policy when policymakers are clear about their policy goals, those aspects of the economy monetary policy can and can't influence, and the economic information that influences their forecasts and policy decisions\" (Mester, 2018).\nShe went on to explain that when policymakers are systematic in their policy responses to changing economic conditions, the public will have a better idea of how the Committee's monetary policy is likely to change in response to anticipated and unanticipated economic developments. In particular, she noted: \"With such knowledge, households and firms can plan better; they can make better saving, borrowing, investment, and employment decisions\" (Mester, 2018).\nThe Evolution of Federal Reserve Communications\nThe view reflected in Loretta's words seems commonplace now, but it wasn't always so. When Loretta joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia in 1985, the FOMC didn't disclose its interest rate decisions. It didn't even report that it had made a decision. In 1981, Karl Brunner, the Swiss monetary economist, called central banking an esoteric art and lamented central banks' \"inherent impossibility to articulate its insights in explicit and intelligible words and sentences\" (Brunner, 1981). At the time, central banking wisdom dictated that monetary policymakers should say as little as possible. Some research of that vintage tried to rationalize this \"secrecy\" through the notion that monetary policy would be particularly effective if it surprised markets.\n2\nIn the 1990s, central bank communication changed dramatically. In 1993, the Fed started to publish FOMC meeting minutes in their current form, and in 1994, it began releasing FOMC meeting transcripts with a five-year lag. In February 1994, the Fed started to publish post-FOMC meeting statements following meetings at which there was a change in the intended federal funds rate. In May 1999, the FOMC started to publish statements after every meeting, even on occasions when there was no change in policy. By then, the move toward greater transparency was fully embraced by Chairman Greenspan, who had once prided himself on \"mumbling with great incoherence.\"\n3\nThere were two primary reasons for this change. First, it was thought that greater transparency would demonstrate the Fed's accountability to the public and safeguard its political independence. Second, there was a growing appreciation in the economics profession that clarity about policy could improve macroeconomic outcomes. Expectations became a focal point in academic and policy circles with the emergence of New Keynesian models in the 1990s as a framework for monetary policy. In these models, aligning the expectations of decisionmakers in the private sector with those of policymakers produced superior economic outcomes.\n4\nMike Woodford, one of the developers of the New Keynesian model, put it this way: \"Not only do expectations about policy matter, but . . . very little\nelse\nmatters\" (Woodford, 2005, p. 402). Communicating a policy strategy and following through on it increased the credibility of the central bank and, therefore, its ability to steer expectations and the economy. Clear communication also helped stabilize the economy and keep inflation closer to target because, when the Fed clearly articulated a reaction function, financial markets would be able to anticipate the likely future course of monetary policy and help the central bank do its work by affecting long-term rates and other asset prices.\nDuring the tenure of Chairman Bernanke, there was another burst of innovation in the way monetary policy was communicated. In 2007, the first SEP was published to convey systematically the economic outlook of FOMC participants. In 2011, Chairman Bernanke started holding press conferences after every other FOMC meeting. In 2012, the Fed adopted an explicit inflation target of 2 percent and started publishing individual FOMC participants' views on the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate, now famously known as the \"dot plot.\"\n5\nDuring these years, Loretta, in her capacity as the research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, contributed to ongoing work on communications, in collaboration with policymakers and Federal Reserve Board staff.\nOf course, this was an extraordinary time for monetary policy, as interest rates in most advanced economies were close to zero following the Global Financial Crisis. The FOMC employed forward guidance\u00e2\u0080\u0094explicit communication about the future path of the policy rate\u00e2\u0080\u0094as a key tool to deal with the unprecedented situation. The research community had found that such forward guidance could be very effective in the context of the New Keynesian paradigm.\n6\nWhen Loretta became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland in 2014, she supported the continued use of forward guidance during these extraordinary times, in particular to communicate a lower-for-longer policy that could provide accommodation in the presence of the effective lower bound constraint. She also insisted that forward guidance could be used effectively even in normal times as a means of clarifying the FOMC's reaction function.\nLoretta, as a member of the FOMC subcommittee on communications, developed and advocated for several proposals to improve communications. One proposal was to publish a measure of uncertainty surrounding the SEP forecast numbers. She was concerned that uncertainty could be underestimated by the public if it wasn't communicated. The proposal was adopted, and \"fan\" charts showing uncertainty associated with the median projections have been a feature of the SEP materials since 2017. Progress toward greater transparency and more effective communication has since continued. For example, since 2019 Chair Powell has been holding a press conference after every FOMC meeting.\nResearchers at academic and policy institutions have made advances in recent years in measuring the effectiveness of central bank communication. For example, several researchers are now using natural language processing techniques to analyze the impact of central bank communications\u00e2\u0080\u0094including statements, press conferences, speeches, and minutes\u00e2\u0080\u0094on asset prices and economic outcomes.\n7\nAnother development is the identification of the effect that Federal Reserve policy communications may have on asset prices using high-frequency financial market data. This empirical strategy has allowed researchers to establish new facts. For example, some economists have found that policymaker speeches affect asset prices as much as the information released via FOMC statements and press conferences, and the effects that central bank communications have on asset prices can differ, depending on whether the communication conveys news about the policy rate path or about the economic outlook.\n8\nCommunication Challenges Facing Policymakers\nAs my brief retelling indicates, we have come a long way. Over the past 30 years, the Fed and many other central banks have embraced transparency and deliberately used their communications as a policy tool. And researchers keep developing better methods to measure and evaluate our communications.\nAt this point, you may be wondering how much longer I am going to talk. And that question leads me to the following one, which is salient for my topic today: Are there limits to the benefits of communication?\nSurely, sometimes central bank communications can have unintended consequences. Let me give you two examples. First, there is always a risk that policymakers' statements about their economic outlook or their expected future path of the policy rate are interpreted by the public with a false sense of certainty. For example, a data-dependent forward-guidance announcement can be mistaken for a commitment to a fixed path of interest rates. When that interpretation is proven wrong down the road, it can create more volatility and uncertainty than if there had been no announcement. That is why policymakers always make sure to stress the data dependence of future policy decisions. Second, it's also possible that the public misinterprets the views of individual policymakers as a Committee view. The potential for misinterpretation is especially acute when many policymakers speak at the same time and disagree with each other.\n9\nThe diversity of viewpoints among policymakers lends itself to stimulating debates and, ultimately, better policy. But in such a situation, more communication could increase rather than reduce uncertainty about our policies.\nI think we stand to benefit a lot from more research in this area. Important questions include, how does the diversity of views among policymakers affect the effectiveness of communications? And, more generally, what distinguishes effective from ineffective central bank communication?\nConclusion\nLet me conclude by repeating what I said at the beginning: To fulfill our dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability, we need to formulate good policies and to make sure that our policies are clearly understood. Doing so helps make monetary policy more effective. Therefore, I encourage researchers to continue to address important questions related to central bank communication. Finally, I congratulate President Mester on her outstanding career in the Federal Reserve System and wish her the best of luck in her new adventures.\nThank you.\nReferences\nAcosta, Miguel (2023). \"A New Measure of Central Bank Transparency and Implications for the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy,\"\nInternational Journal of Central Banking\n, vol. 19 (August), pp. 49\u00e2\u0080\u009397.\nAdam, Klaus, and Roberto M.

Barr\nAt the American University School of Public Affairs Graduation Ceremony, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nCongratulations, Class of 2024! Let me also congratulate your families, friends, teachers, mentors, and everyone else who believed in you and supported you on the path that brought you here today. Thank you, President Burwell, Provost Wilkins, and Dean Jacknowitz.\nBefore I came to the Federal Reserve, I led the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan for five years, so I am used to addressing public policy graduates in May, wearing a robe, and praying it won't rain for the afterparty. Or in Michigan, hail! It is an honor to be able to join in this celebration of you completing your studies and entering a new and exciting stage of your lives. This is particularly special to me, as later in life my mom went back to school at American University (AU) to earn her master's in education. Today, May 10, would have been her birthday\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I can celebrate your path forward and honor her memory.\nI had a chance to speak with a few of your classmates last week, and they gave me a window into the passion and commitment that you bring to your work. It is easy right now for some to look at the world and be cynical about the possibility of making it a better place. But in so many ways, the world is a much better place than it was 50 or 100 years ago, in large part thanks to people like you who've gone into public policy. In my personal experience, I've seen many things get better over the course of my professional lifetime. I can see it now in the work that we do at the Federal Reserve. And most importantly, I can see it in each of you.\nSometimes, it's easy to look at the government or a large corporation or even the nonprofit sector and see some large, distant kind of entity. But the government is made up of individual human beings. You, your friends and your colleagues, your predecessors here at AU, and the people who will come after you. Those individuals make a big difference.\nAnd that's true the moment you leave school. Early on, for example, I worked as a special assistant for Bob Rubin when he was the Secretary of the Treasury. And one of the first things I noticed when he hosted a meeting was that he didn't involve just the top people in the Treasury Department. He included the people who were closer to the issue, such as a research assistant or junior analyst. And he would ask them questions and engage them, and he cared what they thought about the issue. While they didn't necessarily have the same judgment or context as more senior people, they had a lot of knowledge and analytic chops and sometimes a new way of thinking about a problem.\nAnd I've carried that approach to my job today. Many of the people in my meetings at the Federal Reserve are quite junior in the organization, but they speak up in a way that can change how I think about a problem. Please know that you can make a difference as a very junior person and in a very large organization.\nEven if today marks the conclusion of your time in the classroom, it isn't the end of your education. The best career advice that I can offer is also the best advice for a happy life\u00e2\u0080\u0094whatever you do, try to put yourself in a position where you are always learning, every day. This is something my father\u00e2\u0080\u0094a labor lawyer by day and a poet by night\u00e2\u0080\u0094tried to live by. Seeking out a role where you are learning every day will guide you to work that stimulates and motivates you, making you a more knowledgeable and hopefully wiser person, even when the lessons imparted are hard ones. As they often are.\nThis striving to always be learning has guided me to fulfilling work and it has told me, at times, when I needed to take a risk and put myself out there. I was not anyone's first choice for the job I have now, or the job leading the Ford School, or running point on financial reform at Treasury. But I did all of those things. As you will in your lives, when opportunities come along that you never expected.\nWhen I was graduating, I had no idea what I would eventually do in life. And that was scary. That is okay. That is normal. You don't need to know what you want to do for the rest of your life. None of us older people know that either. We're figuring it out as we go.\nI've just mentioned one of the ingredients to doing your best\u00e2\u0080\u0094learning every day and being open to new opportunities even if they are scary\u00e2\u0080\u0094but another more obvious one is effort. It has become more common nowadays to recognize the costs of working too hard, and that is a good thing. But I hope that this emphasis on work-life balance does not deprive you of the satisfaction, and sometimes, joy, that can come from working incredibly hard toward a goal that you find meaningful. Most things worth doing in life are hard.\nAnd if you do want to get anything done in the world, you need a team. There's a Michigan saying: \"the team, the team, the team,\" and it's a good one. You can't do things alone. Certainly, the work that I have found most impactful, whether intellectually or to the world, has been with other people. The work I'm proudest of, as an academic, is work that I did with a psychologist and an economist on behaviorally informed financial regulation. In the process, we changed the way each of us thought about crucial questions we were considering. What an amazing gift to be able to do that with colleagues.\nAlong with working hard to achieve your goals, being open to new opportunities, and working as a team, I think it is also important to be tough. Partly, this means being resilient because life is not a continuous march to the top. I've failed many times. There will be criticism and setbacks, and it is how you respond, constructively, to those developments that will matter much more than the progress you make when things are going great. I use the word \"tough\" because, more than just resilience, sometimes it will be necessary for you to be tough with others. Sometimes you will have to tell colleagues, or even bosses, that they are wrong. Sometimes, you'll have to decide whether to take a stand.\nAnd sometimes being tough requires you to be tough with yourself. When you are in jobs like mine, things go wrong all the time. And it's important to understand that when things go wrong, it is your responsibility. It's not somebody on your team's fault. Your team is giving you the best inputs they can. So having the ability to not point a finger at other people, and to point it at yourself, and understand that you are accountable and responsible, is an important part of being a leader.\nBeing tough doesn't mean being hard or insensitive. One can be resilient, make tough decisions, and stand up to pressure in ways that treat people with respect\u00e2\u0080\u0094the kind of respect that you hope others will show you. One of the primary ways that we show respect for others is to listen. If you are always learning, that means you are always listening, taking on board what you hear from others, even if it is very unwelcome, and perhaps, adjusting your views and gaining knowledge from that input. And it means talking in a way that others can hear.\nOne can make tough decisions and hold people to high standards while treating others well. Treating others well, for me, boils down to a simple rule\u00e2\u0080\u0094don't be a jerk. All of us have had enough experiences with others acting like jerks to understand this advice, but it's a bit harder when applied to yourself. At least for me it is.\nHumility is an attribute that I consider essential to avoid being a jerk. Life often gives one the opportunity to learn and relearn the lesson of humility\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I am humbled every day. Humility is recognizing the limits of knowledge, confidence, and self-regard. It is the line between what we truly know and understand, and what we don't really know and cannot grasp.\nHumility means being open to new information, to weighing information in an objective way, and being able to take on that input and sometimes change one's mind. In a practical way, it means being open to and seriously considering the views of others, and in that sense, it is often a vital way to connect with other people.\nLet me leave you today with two words, the most important two words that you will ever know, or ever say. Those words are \"thank you.\" \"Thank you\" means the recognition that someone has done something valuable for you. Gratitude binds us together. So please turn to your parents, your partners, your friends and other family, your teachers and mentors, your fellow students, and say, thank you.\nCongratulations, Class of 2024, and thank you, for listening to me today.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            May 10, 2024",

Bowman\nAt the Texas Bankers Association 2024 Annual Meeting, Arlington, Texas\nShare\nI would like to thank the Texas Bankers Association for the invitation to share my thoughts with you at this year's Annual Meeting.\n1\nMy remarks today focus on financial stability and the role of banking regulators in promoting financial stability and resiliency in the financial system.\n2\nI will also describe principles that are complementary to promoting safety and soundness\u00e2\u0080\u0094to help inform the regulatory and supervisory agenda.\nOf course, it would be difficult to provide an exhaustive list of the financial stability risks facing the financial system in the time we are together today. So, while I will highlight a few key risks, one must approach this topic with humility, acknowledging that there are limits to a regulator's ability to anticipate every possible financial stability risk in a dynamic and increasingly interconnected world.\nFinancial stability is an important function of the Federal Reserve. Our financial stability function is supported through appropriate monetary policy, bank supervision and regulation, and by monitoring risks in the U.S. and abroad. A stable financial system provides a solid foundation for a healthy banking system and a growing economy that facilitates maximum employment and stable prices. The Fed's recently published\nFinancial Stability Report\ndiscusses financial stability risks in terms of interactions between shocks and vulnerabilities. A financial stability shock is an adverse event or series of events that often occur without warning and severely affect the financial system. A financial stability vulnerability includes a specific characteristic of, or activity conducted in, the financial system that can increase the severity of a stress event when a shock occurs.\n3\nSince shocks are difficult to predict, the Federal Reserve's monitoring efforts primarily focus on vulnerabilities and the buildup of risks that can accrue over time potentially affecting the resiliency of the financial system.\nThe\nFinancial Stability Report\nis worth a read. And while I will not recite the many findings of that report today, I will highlight a few of the risks discussed in the report. It is important to keep in mind that the report provides only a snapshot of the current financial stability vulnerabilities and risks. Because the report treats cyberattacks and geopolitical events as shocks, it touches on them only in a cursory way, even though these are important financial stability risks. Instead, the report focuses on key vulnerabilities that are more easily monitored and provides insights into the financial stability outlook as it relates to these factors.\nWhile the framing of the\nFinancial Stability Report\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094in terms of shocks and vulnerabilities\u00e2\u0080\u0094can be a useful, structured approach to consider this topic, there are many ways to think about financial stability. Often the boundary between shocks and vulnerabilities is a permeable one, and the buildup of risk can become so severe that it becomes a shock. The Federal Reserve plays an important\u00e2\u0080\u0094but limited and non-exclusive\u00e2\u0080\u0094role in proactively addressing financial stability risks and responding to them once they manifest as stress across the system.\nAs I think about the tools we use to address financial stability concerns\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the tradeoffs we are often forced to make when exercising these powers\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is helpful to consider the lessons regulators have learned over time. While the end goal is the same\u00e2\u0080\u0094ensuring resiliency in the financial system to promote financial stability\u00e2\u0080\u0094there are a number of tools that can be used to address the unique characteristics of vulnerabilities and shocks.\nThe Federal Reserve's financial stability monitoring does not operate in a vacuum. To the contrary, our other statutory authorities\u00e2\u0080\u0094including monetary policy or promoting safety and soundness in the banking system\u00e2\u0080\u0094can complement or conflict with the goal of promoting financial stability. Many of these authorities interact with banking activities and institutions that are subject to our supervisory or regulatory authority.\nIn light of this, I will begin by discussing how the use of traditional tools to support safety and soundness\u00e2\u0080\u0094both regulation and supervision\u00e2\u0080\u0094can help promote financial stability. I will then describe the limits of these tools, and then conclude with a brief discussion of some other key financial stability risks.\nFinancial Stability and the Role of Regulators\nThe Federal Reserve plays an important but limited role in promoting the stability of the financial system through resiliency to shocks, and by proactively addressing vulnerabilities. This responsibility can be complemented and supported, or in some cases weakened through the execution of the Federal Reserve's other responsibilities, including monetary policy or the exercise of our emergency authorities. At times, these objectives may appear to present tension or be in conflict.\nFor example, the banking stress last year resulted from a number of underlying causes. But it is clear that trends in the interest rate environment when the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) was rapidly tightening policy to combat inflation were an important factor that contributed to Silicon Valley Bank's (SVB's) failure. The Federal Reserve's documented supervisory shortcomings and the lack of SVB management attention to these risks were also key contributors to the firm's failure.\nTo be sure, the role of monetary policy in the demise of SVB does not excuse SVB's management from its inability to manage the firm's interest rate risk exposures or excuse the ineffective supervisory response that enabled the buildup of the firm's excessive risk. And I am not calling into question the FOMC's monetary policy decisions from that time, which were appropriately focused on our congressionally established mandates of maximum employment and stable prices. Instead, these issues highlight the challenging interrelationships of the various roles and functions of the Federal Reserve.\nThis becomes more complicated when we consider the Federal Reserve's financial stability objectives in the context of its prudential mandates to promote the safe and sound operation of regulated financial institutions. The tools of bank regulation and supervision can promote the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, but they can also be a positive force when it comes to financial stability. When regulators are successful in their task of ensuring the safe and sound operation of the banking system\u00e2\u0080\u0094one of the core mandates for banking regulators\u00e2\u0080\u0094often there is a corresponding benefit to financial stability. Put another way, if the individual parts of the banking system are healthy, this often promotes the health and stability of the broader financial system.\nBut the goal of promoting bank safety and soundness is narrowly focused within the regulatory perimeter\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the institutions and activities within our regulatory and supervisory authority. By contrast, financial stability must be concerned with the broader financial system, including the multitude of nonbank institutions that play an important role not only in delivering financial products and services, but also in the broader U.S. economy.\nSo today, I'd like to share three principles that can help frame a discussion of the role of banking regulators in promoting financial stability:\nBank supervision can be an effective and efficient tool to promote financial stability. It is important that supervisors focus on core banking risks.\nWhere bank regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we need to take a hard look at whether those risks are justified by the safety-and-soundness benefits of the regulation.\nAs we evaluate the merits of bank regulation and supervision, we must consider how the Federal Reserve's regulatory proposals affect markets and institutions beyond the bank regulatory perimeter. This will enable us to better understand the potential unintended consequences.\nThere is value in our current approach to addressing financial stability risks. We monitor risks and how they build up or manifest as stress in the financial system. And we react in a way that is informed by that monitoring, either to proactively address the buildup of risk, or to address the consequences of events that could threaten financial stability. A review of past events that presented stability concerns can help us evaluate our existing work and inform the direction of future investments.\nEffective Bank Supervision to Promote Financial Stability\nFirst, bank supervision can be an effective and efficient tool to promote financial stability. I think it is helpful to consider commercial real estate (CRE) as an example.\n4\nCommercial real estate continues to be an area of focus for both banks and regulators. Some banks have experienced an increase in CRE loan delinquencies, although delinquency rates generally remain low. As we know, one of the factors that has led to CRE stress in certain property types, like office, is the post-pandemic changes in the demand for, and use of, these CRE properties. Should this trend continue, we could see declines in property values, reduced rental income cash flows, or other conditions that could lead to impairment of some banks' CRE loans or portfolios, especially if those loans mature and are refinanced at higher interest rates. I expect we will continue to see material differences in the performance of CRE across the various types of commercial property and in specific geographic regions. This will be due, in part, to variations in regional return-to-office patterns, and the shifting demand for different types of CRE properties.\nSo, what can we learn from this CRE experience? First, supervision can be an effective tool to mitigate vulnerabilities, like the increasing credit risk associated with certain kinds of lending. Underwriting standards and loan-to-value ratios have improved significantly since the 2008\u00e2\u0080\u009309 financial crisis, and more recently we have seen credit conditions for CRE lending tighten, even as loan demand weakened. I see this as reflecting both better management of these loans and portfolios, and more proactive supervision of material risk.\n5\nBanks are also well-equipped to work with their CRE borrowers to mitigate stress, including through loan accommodations and workouts.\n6\nSupervision can be particularly effective at addressing well-known, core banking risks, especially when this supervisory work is conducted effectively and without being distracted by non-core risks.\nDespite the promise of supervision as a tool to promote financial stability, supervision can sometimes fail to address the significant buildup of traditional risk. And supervision can be susceptible to being diverted from core risks to issues of less material concern. For example, take the dynamics that led to the failure of SVB. The buildup of interest rate risk in the banking system was a known vulnerability and material risk, not just for SVB, but for all financial institutions. The responsibility for managing this risk fell on the management team at SVB, just as it falls on every bank that has material exposure to interest rate risk. And yet, the failure of SVB created something of a \"shock\" event within the banking system, one that led to a vigorous response with the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program and invoking the systemic risk exemption to guarantee all depositors of SVB and Signature Bank.\nI think it is an oversimplification to point to any one factor as the root cause of the failure of SVB. There were a number of issues that contributed to the firm's ultimate failure. These events included rapid growth, poor risk management, poor public communication, a lack of supervisory attention to core risks, and an insufficiently robust supervisory response to the buildup of interest rate and funding risk. These issues were exacerbated by operational and technological problems with FedWire and discount window lending. The cumulative effect of these issues likely accelerated the firm's failure and increased the scope of the resulting financial harm. But certainly, this is a clear example of where the Federal Reserve's proactive tools\u00e2\u0080\u0094supervision of risk management, and the operation of liquidity support and payment tools\u00e2\u0080\u0094could have been much more effective.\nTherefore, the virtue of supervision as a proactive measure to support financial stability comes with a cautionary note. Ineffective supervision itself can compound financial stability risks by allowing the buildup of risk without commensurate risk-management measures or supervisory attention. One protective measure that we can take to support effective supervision is to ensure that focus on traditional risks is not lost or diluted. One example of a supervisory and regulatory distraction is from the Fed's recent focus on climate risk. Recently, the Federal Reserve conducted a pilot climate scenario exercise with a subset of the largest U.S. global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and issued guidance to large institutions on managing climate-related financial risk. This regulatory attention and focus on one specific, non-core risk could reasonably call into question whether regulatory priorities are focused sufficiently on key risks. Firms are already required to manage all material risks, and prioritizing climate risk in this way could lead to the misallocation of risk-management resources.\nRegulatory Approaches to Promote Financial Stability\nSecond, where regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we need to take a close look at whether those risks are justified by the safety and soundness benefits of the regulation.\nFor example, consider the threat to financial stability resulting from market illiquidity. Liquidity is essential to effective market functioning, and liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market is particularly important due to its critical role in the U.S. and global financial systems.\n7\nThis is an area that, in relative terms, has recently experienced stress events as in the September 2019 repo market stress, and the so-called \"dash for cash\" in March of 2020. These events raised concerns about the resiliency of U.S. Treasury markets. Even today, some indicators signal low market liquidity through market depth in U.S. Treasury cash markets, which have been at levels below historical norms.\n8\nBanks play an important role in providing liquidity, and there are clear signs that liquidity in Treasury markets is low.\n9\nWhile there may be a number of reasons for reduced Treasury market liquidity, I would note tw",

Cook\nAt the Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, David. And thank you to the Brookings Institution for hosting me today. I am especially grateful to return to the place where, in my first job as an aspiring economist, I was a research assistant for Alice Rivlin over three decades ago.\nToday, I would like to talk about the Board's work in pursuit of financial stability, which is critical to the well-being of households, firms, and the broader economy.\n1\nFollowing the financial crisis of 2007\u00e2\u0080\u009309, a broad set of reforms were put in place to bolster financial stability. To ensure an ongoing focus on that area, the Board established its Committee on Financial Stability as a venue for Governors to discuss related developments and policy issues. I recently became the chair of this committee and will share with you my current views on financial stability and touch on a couple of emerging issues. Enhancing the public's understanding of our work on financial stability is important for the transparency and accountability of our efforts. That is why we communicate our financial stability work prominently in our\nFinancial Stability Report,\nwhich was most recently published last month and provides more detail on some of the developments I will review today.\n2\nFinancial Stability at the Federal Reserve\nAs the U.S. and global financial system continues to grow and evolve in complexity, the Fed's work on financial stability only becomes more important. A stable and resilient financial system is essential for the Federal Reserve to achieve its dual mandate of maximum-employment and price-stability. Our financial stability work also informs our approach and priorities to the supervision and regulation of banking organizations, our coordination with domestic regulatory agencies, and our engagements with international bodies such as the Financial Stability Board.\nFinancial Stability Framework\nWhen people think about financial stability, they most often recall periods affected by adverse shocks\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, severe, unexpected events that cause widespread disruptions to the financial markets and, in turn, the broader economy. The challenge is that such events are hard to predict.\nTherefore, the Fed's financial stability framework focuses on understanding what makes the financial system vulnerable to a whole range of potential shocks and how those vulnerabilities might amplify the effects of those shocks, not on predicting specific adverse events.\nReview of Vulnerabilities\nBased on extensive research and experience, we routinely monitor four broad sets of vulnerabilities to the financial system that could amplify shocks: household and business leverage; the use of leverage by financial institutions; the degree of maturity and liquidity transformation in the financial system, or, in plain English, \"funding risk\"; and asset valuations and risk appetite.\nHousehold and Firm Leverage\nTo lay out how I am currently thinking about each of these vulnerabilities, I will start with household and firm leverage. A simple measure of whether households or firms are borrowing too much is to compare their debt to the level of GDP, as shown in\nfigure 1\n. Based on this measure, household borrowing is lower than it has been in many years. Our analysis then dives deeper, including detailed assessments of mortgage borrowing and consumer credit, and this deeper assessment supports the view of a resilient household sector. Nonetheless, we also are attuned to possible changes in this assessment. For example, I am watching closely the rising delinquency rates on auto loans and credit card debt\u00e2\u0080\u0094both of which partially reflect a normalization from recent lows\u00e2\u0080\u0094because they imply increasing household borrower stress, especially among some lower- and moderate-income households.\nFrom the figure, you can also see that, looking through the unusual pandemic period, business debt relative to GDP remains above historical norms. Despite this, most firms still have ample earnings to cover their scheduled interest and principal payments. This solid position reflects resilient earnings and the fact that firms with access to bond markets locked in long-term funding during the low interest rate environment of 2020 and 2021. As a result, most firms also appear, in broad terms, resilient to potential adverse shocks.\nFinancial Leverage and Funding Risk\nLet me turn now to the leverage and funding risk in the financial sector.\nIn assessing these vulnerabilities, we tend to place a lot of weight on the capital adequacy and liquidity of the largest and most interconnected financial firms. Currently, these firms appear well positioned to absorb a shock. For instance,\nfigure 2\nshows the ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets\u00e2\u0080\u0094a standard regulatory capital measure\u00e2\u0080\u0094for three groups of banks. This ratio has been increasing for all types of banks lately and, for the largest banks, stands at multidecade highs. The largest banks also have strong funding profiles, owing in part to the strength of the regulatory regime for these banks.\nDespite the overall resilience of the banking sector, some regional banks experienced large deposit outflows amid the failures of three banks last spring. Conditions have improved considerably since then: Bank profitability remains solid, and deposit flows have stabilized. In addition, as shown in\nfigure 3\n, most institutions have lowered their reliance on uninsured deposits since the beginning of 2023. We remain attuned to vulnerabilities in this sector. Supervisors are working closely with the set of banks that have experienced outsized fair-value losses from higher interest rates and with banks that have high concentrations of commercial real estate loans.\nWe have varying levels of visibility into the leverage and funding vulnerabilities of other financial intermediaries. While there are some areas of apparent vulnerability, there is also evidence of resilience. Hedge fund leverage is hard to measure, but available data suggest that these funds' leverage is near the high end of its range. Large insurers are well capitalized, but they have been increasing their use of liabilities subject to rollover risk at the same time as they have raised the portion of their assets invested in riskier corporate debt instruments. Money funds have inherent funding vulnerabilities that regulators have been taking steps to address. Reforms adopted by the SEC and coming into force this year will improve funds' liquidity positions and address the structural first-mover advantages among money fund investors that contributed to some of the runs we have seen in this sector over the years.\nAsset Valuations\nLet me turn now to asset valuations. I think it is helpful to consider this potential vulnerability in the context of how a sharp change in valuations could interact with the vulnerabilities I have already discussed. I will start with the classic concern for all of us who lived through the Great Recession: A large decline in asset prices against the backdrop of a weak economy. For example, house prices are high relative to historical benchmarks, likely owing partly to a limited supply of homes for sale. What might the implications be if house prices were to weaken at some future date?\nThe house-price growth we have seen over the past few years has not been accompanied by increased lending or weaker credit standards, as was the case in the early 2000s. The household sector also is much more resilient than in 2006. One way to see this is to run the distribution of risk characteristics we see in the household sector through a constant set of income and house-price shocks.\n3\nThe stronger underwriting standards that have prevailed since the post-crisis reforms went into place and stronger household balance sheets mean that post-stress delinquency rates should be lower the next time we experience a housing shock. Finally, the financial system is in substantially stronger shape to resist any losses that do occur: The largest banks are subject to stress tests that require them to be able to continue to function through a severe recession, and important structural improvements have been implemented among nonbank entities.\nCommercial Real Estate\nNow I will turn to commercial real estate, or \"CRE,\" where the shocks created by the COVID-19 pandemic continue to reverberate.\nCRE is a broad asset class, encompassing multifamily housing, hospitality, retail, warehouses, office buildings, and many other business properties. Accounting for this heterogeneity is important in assessing the risks associated with CRE. Properties have been differentially impacted by changes in the way many people live, shop, and work. For instance, occupancy rates of suburban medical offices are very different from those of downtown corporate headquarters. Looking at broader trends, values of office buildings have been most affected by lifestyle changes, and values of multifamily properties have also dropped over the past year. These trends present challenges for property owners and lenders, who will need to manage those risks and make appropriate adjustments as the outstanding loans come due.\nAs of the fourth quarter of last year, banks accounted for a bit more than half of the $6 trillion in outstanding debt backed by CRE.\nFigure 4\nshows that much of that exposure is in smaller regional and community banks. On average, CRE loans make up only about 5 percent of total assets at large banks but around 30 percent of assets at smaller banks. Those high concentrations have caused us to step up our supervisory work with community and regional banks that have significant CRE concentrations and to augment our regulatory data for this sector. For instance, data available from SEC Form 10-Q filings suggest that office exposures account for a small share of most regional banks' CRE loans.\n4\nAll told, I view CRE risks currently as sizable but manageable, and I will be paying close attention to the sector in the short and medium run.\nPrivate Credit\nRisks related to CRE are well known to investors and supervisors alike. Another big part of our job is to look for emerging vulnerabilities, and one that has garnered my attention is private debt. Private credit generally refers to direct loans made to businesses, mostly middle-market firms, by nonbank entities such as private debt funds and business development companies. In the U.S., private credit funds' assets under management have grown rapidly in recent years. They were estimated to stand at $1.1 trillion as of September 2023, comparable in size to both the high-yield bond and institutional leveraged-loan markets.\nHistory teaches us that rapidly growing lending often involves weak underwriting or excessive risk appetite. The growth in private credit is likely attributable to a confluence of factors. After the financial crisis of 2007\u00e2\u0080\u009309, private equity investments and leveraged buyouts grew quickly, and demand for credit from middle-market and private equity-sponsored firms grew along with them. Some borrowers appear to prefer private credit deals to bank lending because of easier deal execution and greater contractual flexibility, particularly during the ups and downs of the economic cycle. In addition, the growth of private credit coincided with a period in which stronger bank regulation and supervision were put in place, suggesting that those actions to make banks safer played a role.\nOverall, I think that the growth of private credit likely has not materially adversely affected the financial system's resilience. Private credit funds appear well positioned to hold the riskiest parts of corporate lending. These intermediaries generally use little leverage and are organized as closed-end funds, which means that investors cannot withdraw the funding supporting the investments. Nonetheless, private credit funds also have growing interconnections with traditional financial intermediaries, including banks. Banks are increasingly originating their own private credit deals\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as through business development companies that are operated or minority-owned by the banks themselves. As a result, I will be monitoring the contribution of private credit to the overall leverage of the business sector and the evolving interconnectedness between private credit and the rest of the financial system.\nCyber Risks and Financial Stability\nI will conclude with a few thoughts on cyber risk. I should emphasize at the outset that the Federal Reserve's role in managing cyber vulnerabilities is focused primarily on ensuring the institutions we supervise effectively manage the cyber risks they face, including from key technology service providers to those institutions, and safeguarding the resilience of the services provided by the Federal Reserve and the financial system more broadly in the event of a successful attack. We also work with our partners across the government, including the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and with the private sector to understand and address cyber risks.\nOver the past few years, we have seen an accelerating tempo of cyberattacks from a mix of groups associated with criminal enterprises and hostile governments. While the news sometimes seems dominated by ransomware attacks, we also continue to observe other types of attacks, such as those that seek to uncover information from governments and firms or to carry out or plant the seeds for destructive attacks on information systems that could severely disrupt operations.\nIn response to these risks, we are examining cyber incidents carefully to make sure we have a fuller understanding of how attacks can affect the financial system, including through banks, nonbank financial firms, digital service providers, and critical infrastructure. In this work, we focus heavily on the operational resilience of the institutions we supervise, the service providers used by such institutions, and the financial services provided by the Federal Reserve. We have also begun to incorporate analysis of timely data on firm-level cyber vulnerabilities and interconnections across firms and with service providers to monitor cyber vulnerabilities at the system level.\nAs we contemplate future incidents, my view is that financial resilience can also play a crucial role in mitigating the adverse effects of cyberattacks. Cyberattacks erode the confidence that investors and institutions have in each other and in the financial sector. While strong capital and liquidity positions will not, by themselves, prevent an intrusion, they leave the affected institution in a better position to rejoin the system once the attack is resolved and, most importantly, promote confidence among i",

Cook\nAt the 2024 Commencement, Georgia College and State University College of Business and Technology and College of Arts and Sciences, at separate ceremonies, Milledgeville, Georgia\nShare\nWatch Live\nGovernor Cook delivered identical remarks at separate ceremonies for the College of Business and Technology and College of Arts and Sciences on the same date.\nGreetings Georgia College and State University Class of 2024! Congratulations to all of you. For those earning your bachelor's degrees, you entered college during the pandemic and made it through a very challenging time to obtain a college education. For those of you earning graduate degrees, you took on a difficult course of study while in many cases also working and caring for families. The path may have been long and winding, but you did it. Congratulations and thanks also to your families, friends, professors, mentors, and everyone else who walked with you on the journey that brought you here today.\nIt has been a journey, but I imagine that most of you are thinking a lot more right now about the path ahead. And I do want to talk to you about the places you'll go and the things you'll do. I think that one of the most exciting aspects of this moment is the infinite set of possibilities your future holds. If you have any doubts about that, let me tell you about the improbable, unimaginable journey that has led me here\u00e2\u0080\u0094back here\u00e2\u0080\u0094today.\nIt is customary at commencements to hand the speaking duties over to an alumnus or alumna of the college or university who has gone forth and done well. I note with approval that this is exactly what GCSU has done this year, by inviting two distinguished alumnae to speak at ceremonies for the College of Health Sciences and the College of Education. So, I will stipulate that I am not a graduate of GCSU. However, my roots here run much deeper than that.\nI was born and raised here in Milledgeville, but in many ways, it was Georgia College, as it was known then, that was my home. My mother, Professor Mary Murray Cook, was the first tenured African American faculty member at this university. She was a member of the faculty of the department of nursing here for 17 years. I want to thank several of her former students and advisees, including Deborah Davis Arnold Boyd, Mary Gordy Hurt, and former professor in the department of nursing Ella Milner, as well as some of her former colleagues, Dr. John Sallstrom and Dr. Harriett Whipple, for joining us here today. Let me also acknowledge and thank my sisters, other family members, friends, former church members, and former Girl Scouts in attendance today.\nMy feelings about GCSU begin with immense gratitude. It was rare in the early 1960s for colleges to hire, let alone to grant tenure to, an African American man or woman, particularly in a rural community in Georgia. My father, Rev. Payton B. Cook, worked as a chaplain and then in senior leadership at the state hospital. But due to my mother's participation in many aspects of the college, I grew up here, on this campus.\nMy family lived through the events that brought Milledgeville out of a deeply segregated South and made Georgia College and State University into the university it is today. My sisters and I attended the Peabody School, a laboratory school created and run by GCSU's College of Education. In that contentious era, we helped desegregate Peabody. Some of the students did not welcome us, but the school did. While Milledgeville moved forward in fits and starts, Peabody was a nurturing and positive place for me, much like the university it served. One of my fondest memories at Peabody was when teachers allowed us to take classroom pets home for the weekend. On one occasion, my sisters and I cared for a guinea pig, an event that was remembered by us with delight, but rather differently by my parents. Outside my home and those of my extended family, the lab school was the first place to seriously entertain and cultivate our curiosity. I would also like to acknowledge my great teachers at Baldwin High School who were trained at Georgia College. One I especially remember fondly was my AP English teacher and writer extraordinaire, Sandra Worsham. She was constantly writing and sharing her writing and writing practice with us. She submitted her short stories to the\nNew Yorker\n, got rejected, and, with great tenacity, resubmitted her work elsewhere, which was an invaluable skill to learn as an aspiring professor who dreamed of being published. Thank you!\nMuch of my childhood revolved around Georgia College. The scholars in my family were social and natural scientists, and my sisters and I entered science fairs that were supported by GCSU and sometimes judged by its faculty.\nWe also learned a lot from students at Georgia College. We were especially sponges in the presence of the international students, so far from home, whom my mother advised and whom my parents took a special interest in and often invited to church at Flagg Chapel and to our house for Sunday dinner. These students brought the world to us. My sisters and I will also forever be grateful to another group of students, our GCSU babysitters, who were critical in promoting scholastic achievement while exposing us to popular culture, which we had little access to at home. They smuggled in music by Earth, Wind, and Fire, Teddy Pendergrass, and other artists, rescuing the Cook girls from being seen as complete nerds.\nSomething else that brought the world to me was the GCSU library, and its amazing librarians, who could assist a curious girl who always had more questions. Around my house, many questions from the pesky kids were met with, \"Ask your mom\", or \"Ask your dad.\" And, if my parents did not know the answer, they said \"Ask the encyclopedia or the librarian (at Georgia College)!\" The librarians and archivists took special pride in preserving the legacy of renowned author Flannery O'Connor, a resident of Milledgeville and 1945 graduate of Georgia College for Women, as it was known then. I remember walking by an exhibit displaying some part of the O'Connor archives each time I visited the library.\nThe Georgia College community introduced us to the world in many other ways. Allied Arts, the local arts-presenting organization, partnered with the university to bring world renowned dance, theater, and music performances, as well as the visual arts, to the college community and the town. Betty Snyder, whom some faculty and staff might remember, was the indefatigable force and immense talent leading Allied Arts at the time. Her daughter, Genie Snyder Chamberlain, is with us today. The national arts program of the public service organization Delta Sigma Theta Sorority also partnered with my mother and the college to bring well- and little-known history makers to campus. In the seventh grade, I was afforded the transformative opportunity as a student journalist to interview three of these figures\u00e2\u0080\u0094poet Nikki Giovanni; Rosey Grier, the actor, football star, and entrepreneur; and Olympian and track star Wilma Rudolph.\nGeorgia College not only brought the world to us, but it also brought us to the world, a world larger than ourselves. For my family, GCSU always represented the promise, so fundamental to the Civil Rights Movement, that education would help bring about the fairer and more just world that we hoped to make. The first students of African descent were integrating the college and, with their classmates, implementing the change they wanted to see in the world. My sisters and I distinctly remember the day the college voted to make history in the 1970s and selected Monica Manns as the first Black woman to become Miss Georgia College.\nIn a fundamental way, on this campus, what mattered was intelligence, knowledge, and effort. For me personally, from an early age, GCSU and the world it opened to me was evidence that I could do anything in life and be anyone I dreamed of being, regardless of where I was raised and whatever my race or gender.\nGCSU represented the endless possibilities of what I could do with my life, but it also planted the seeds of what I have actually done.\nWhen I was in the sixth grade, my mother helped to start a Delta Sigma Theta chapter at GCSU. Are there some Deltas out there today? It was there I first heard about the woman who was Delta's first national president: Dr. Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander. She was the first African American woman to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania law school, the first Black woman to practice law in that state, and an early civil rights activist. She went on to serve on President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights and played a prominent role in Philadelphia's civic life.\nBut before all those achievements, Sadie Alexander's first interest was economics. She wanted to understand, among other things, what the major causes were of black unemployment, which became the topic of her dissertation. Dr. Alexander was the second African American woman, ever, to earn a Ph.D. and the first African American to earn one in economics. But, unlike my mother decades later, in the 1920s, Sadie Alexander was actively denied entry to her chosen profession, the one she made history in, on the basis of her race and sex. Lesser people would have been crushed by this impediment. But she stepped around this barrier, made lemonade out of lemons, and pursued her interest in economic opportunity through the law instead.\nSo, in seventh grade, at the Baldwin County social science fair, I took up the subject of Sadie Alexander's dissertation. Collecting my own data and employing some of the data and discoveries of economics over the ensuing decades gathered at Georgia College's library, I researched the major causes of African American unemployment. I remember that the local newspaper, the Union-Recorder, marked this occasion with a photograph of 12-year old me. I sincerely hope that picture remains lost to history!\nI did not know it at the time, but this was the beginning of my interest in economics. I did not know it myself when I went away to college\u00e2\u0080\u0094ranging as far away as Atlanta\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I did not know it when I graduated and was thinking about the appropriate field of graduate study.\nI figured it out, as it happened, at another place I never imagined I might get to\u00e2\u0080\u0094the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. I was hiking alongside a British economist who, by the end of that trek, had me convinced that economics possessed the tools to address some really big and important questions\u00e2\u0080\u0094questions, I realized, I had been excited and enthralled by since my seventh-grade research project largely done at Georgia College's library. This economist also advised me on the higher-level math courses I would need to take to prepare to do a Ph.D. in economics, and within months I moved back home and enrolled in the first of those math courses at Georgia College.\nI relentlessly pursued the economic questions we discussed on Kilimanjaro and related questions, in graduate school in California and then in Moscow, where I conducted dissertation research on banking in pre- and post-Soviet Russia. I became a researcher and professor, teaching first at Harvard University and then at Michigan State University. While much of my research relates to various aspects of economic growth and innovation, I have spent time in various roles addressing why few women and people of color enter and advance in the economics profession, which is related to my research on patent teams. Then, in 2022, I had the honor of being nominated by President Biden to serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, whose decisions affect the entire economy and the well-being of everyone in America.\nIt is a very wide circle that I have traced to return here today. And now that I have told you a little about the role GCSU has played in my life, I think that you may begin to see why this homecoming for me is so meaningful and emotional.\nBut I also hope that you can see what this story should mean to you. It means that whoever you are, wherever you come from, and whatever anyone has ever said about you or your capabilities, you can be anything and anyone you want to be. If you wonder what the future holds for someone like you, someone educated here in a small town in Georgia, who then makes their way in the world: I am here today to tell you that where you come from and have been is not necessarily where you are going, and that the possibilities are endless. Georgia College and State University has prepared you Bobcats well. You will only be limited by your motivation, preparation, and imagination.\nOh, the places you'll go, and the things you'll do, GCSU Class of 2024! Your family, friends, former professors, your community, and I cannot wait to see it all and are cheering you on. Huge congratulations, again!\nThank you.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            May 04, 2024",

Bowman\nAt the Massachusetts Bankers Association Annual Convention, Key Biscayne, Florida\nShare\nI would like to thank the Massachusetts Bankers Association for the invitation to meet with you today.\n1\nOne of the most enjoyable and informative aspects of my role is the time I spend with bankers, listening to issues that are important to you and that affect you and your customers. Banks play a key role in supporting economic growth and lending to serve their customers and communities, which is an indispensable role in the U.S. economy. Conversations such as ours today help inform my work at the Federal Reserve Board\u00e2\u0080\u0094for my understanding of both the broader U.S. economy and the banking regulatory and supervisory environment.\nBefore our conversation, I would like to briefly touch on the economy and monetary policy.\nOver the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our meeting earlier this week, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5\u00e2\u0080\u00911/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.\nAfter seeing considerable progress on slowing inflation last year, we have not seen further progress over the first quarter of this year. The 12-month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation have moved roughly sideways since December and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in March. With annualized 3-month core PCE inflation jumping to 4.4 percent in March, well above average inflation in the second half of last year, I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time. The recent pickup seems to be evident across many goods and services categories, suggesting that inflation was temporarily lower in the latter half of last year. Prices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which is weighing on consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation throughout this episode.\nEconomic activity increased at a strong pace last year and has maintained momentum over the first three months of this year. Although first-quarter growth in gross domestic product was temporarily dampened by volatile categories, such as inventories and net exports, consumer spending on services remained robust, and residential activity and business investment in equipment and intangibles strengthened. Payroll employment has increased at a strong pace through April this year, partly reflecting increased immigrant labor supply. Although we had seen signs of the labor market coming into better balance, recent employment reports show a continued tight labor market, with the unemployment rate remaining below 4 percent, and the number of job openings relative to unemployed workers is still above its pre-pandemic level. Last year, the average pace of job gains slowed, and the labor force participation rate rose. In recent months, however, job growth has rebounded, and labor force participation has flattened out around its peak from last year, suggesting there has not been further improvement in labor supply along this margin, as labor force participation among those aged 55 and older has been persistently low.\nAt its current setting, our monetary policy stance appears to be restrictive, and I will continue to monitor the incoming data to assess whether monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our target. As I've noted recently, my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook.\nFirst, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in part to immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unclear whether further supply-side improvements will continue to lower inflation. Geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains, putting additional upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices. There is also the risk that the loosening in financial conditions since late last year and additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate.\nFinally, there is a risk that strong consumer demand for services, increased immigration, and continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation. Given the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize. Wage growth has remained at an elevated rate of between 4 and 5 percent, still higher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal given trend productivity growth.\nIn light of these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the current state of the economy as well as predicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging, and I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.\nThank you, and I look forward to our conversation.\n1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\nReturn to text\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            May 03, 2024",

I would like to thank Supervision at the New York Fed for inviting me to join you at this year's Regional and Community Banking Conference. These forums enable us to continue our engagement with bankers in the industry to address a variety of issues and challenges that exist in the current banking environment. Some of the topics that will be covered today include contingency funding, operational readiness, market uncertainties, and banking innovations. I appreciate that you have joined us to discuss these and several other topics on our agenda.\nBefore we get started, I would like to highlight a few areas of concern and identify some changed supervisory expectations that may provide a useful backdrop for the discussions.\nThe Banking Landscape and Risks Today\nOver the past few years, we have experienced a number of challenges around the world and in the U.S. that have reverberated throughout the economy and have required banks to confront and mitigate the associated risks\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the pandemic, a sharp rise in inflation with an associated rapid rise in interest rates, CRE market uncertainties due to changing work and business preferences, increased third-party fintech engagement in the banking industry, and the 2023 bank failures. Today, we find ourselves at an inflection point in banking and financial services. Some traditional risks\u00e2\u0080\u0094like liquidity risk and interest rate risk\u00e2\u0080\u0094have become a higher priority concern for banks and regulators, while other risks\u00e2\u0080\u0094like third-party risk and cybersecurity risk\u00e2\u0080\u0094continue to evolve and pose new challenges. Bankers and regulators alike must consider how our reactions to these issues will impact the future of the banking system, and how safety and soundness, consumer protection, U.S. financial stability, and the ongoing and future role of banks within the U.S. financial system will be affected.\nBanks must ensure their risk-management frameworks appropriately identify, measure, monitor, and control for both existing and emerging risks. They must continue to innovate responsibly and ensure their risk-management frameworks account for novel product offerings both prior to implementation and as the service and customer engagement evolves.\nRegulators must consider the many tradeoffs in their approach to supervision and regulation to most effectively support banks as they embark upon and continue on this journey. In their quest to be agile by offering new services and responding to new and evolving risks, banks must have access to and understand the rules of the road. Similarly, supervisors must be knowledgeable in how to appropriately identify, supervise, and regulate emerging risks. Regulators must encourage and support responsible innovation as banks expand their product offerings to serve the needs of their customers and communities.\nRisk Management and Contingency Funding\nShifting to contingency funding plans, given the expanding number of challenges and shocks that the economy has faced over the past few years, it is prudent for banks not only to continue to evolve and update emergency planning activities in light of these risks, but also to test their emergency plans.\nSince the banking stress and bank failures last spring, these risks have led to heightened liquidity risks for some firms. I understand that supervisors at the New York Fed and across the Federal Reserve System have engaged with state member banks and holding companies about appropriate risk management and have indicated that those plans should include emergency borrowing from the discount window if a bank's condition warrants a need for emergency liquidity. Last year, the Federal Reserve Board issued updated guidance noting that depository institutions should regularly evaluate and update their contingency funding plans.\n1\nAll banks should have emergency contingency funding plans in place. Liquidity planning must include access to funding sources that can be utilized when they are most needed, which may include borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Banks or from the discount window.\nHowever, as I've noted previously, while it may be appropriate for supervisors to encourage banks to establish and maintain contingency funding sources, test the contingency funding plans, and evaluate whether those plans are adequate in the context of examination, supervisors are not bankers. And we must be cautious not to cross the line from supervisor to member of the management team and avoid interfering with the decisionmaking of bank management. We must also ensure that liquidity requirements and supervisory expectations are commensurate with the bank's size, complexity, and risk profile.\nSupervisory Changes\nRegulators have an important role to play in ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking system in light of evolving risks. These risks can be exacerbated by shortcomings in bank supervision, as we saw last spring. These bank failures and the events and circumstances surrounding them warrant review, self-reflection, and where necessary, appropriately targeted changes to identified gaps in regulation and supervision. We should carefully examine what is working and what can be improved in bank supervision. In doing so, we must appropriately and effectively manage our supervisory programs, teams, and expectations to ensure that efficient, effective, and consistent supervision is implemented across our regulated entities according to a bank's complexity, size, risk profile, and scope of activities. Conducting supervision in a manner that respects due process and provides transparency around supervisory expectations goes a long way in accomplishing these goals.\nWe should acknowledge that changes to supervisory expectations and processes, coupled with the sheer volume of recent regulatory and supervisory reforms and proposed reforms, will undoubtedly present additional challenges and risks for banks. While some changes to the supervisory process and priorities may be appropriate to promote a safe and sound financial system and enhance financial stability, having an appropriate focus on the most salient risks is important for effective risk management and effective supervision. We should be cautious that these changes do not distract banks or supervisors from focusing on core and emerging risks or impair the long-term viability of the banking system\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially for mid-sized and smaller banks.\nIn closing, I hope that today's conference provides an opportunity for open and frank conversations about prudent risk management and how we can work together to maintain a safe and sound financial system. Thank you for taking the time to be with us today. I hope you enjoy the conference, and I look forward to spending more time discussing these issues with you in the future.\n1.

Jefferson\nAt the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Matteo. It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 13th International Research Forum on Monetary Policy. The vibrant discussions you will engage in at this conference, and your research more broadly, will help us to understand better the origins and implications of uncertainty. I became a member of the Federal Reserve Board just as it was grappling with the economic after-effects of the pandemic, a once-in-a-century disturbance of worldwide significance. As a result, I know from firsthand experience that understanding the main sources of uncertainty and how best to make monetary policy decisions in the presence of uncertainty are crucial to policymaking.\nI will take this opportunity to do a couple of things. First, I will review a few historical examples of how economic thinking on monetary policymaking in the presence of uncertainty has evolved. Second, I will consider lessons learned from these examples that could influence how monetary policymakers think about the policy choices the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) faces currently.\n1\nThe 1960s to the 1980s\nIn the 1960s, during the heyday of Keynesian macroeconomics, researchers widely believed that monetary policymakers faced a long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, and that the tradeoff could be calibrated to keep unemployment indefinitely low at an acceptable cost in terms of higher inflation. Improvements in econometric modeling abounded, and the harnessing of\noptimal-control\nmethods developed in the field of engineering held out the prospect that business cycle fluctuations could be stabilized.\nThere were contrarians, of course, most notably Milton Friedman, who highlighted the necessity of monetary policymakers to consider what they\ndon't\nknow in their decisionmaking process (Friedman, 1968). Friedman's statement that monetary policy works with \"long and variable lags\" was, among other things, an argument against policymakers trying to fine-tune the level of economic activity. In recognition of policymakers' limited knowledge of short-run economic relationships, Friedman advocated the use of simple rules for monetary policy, such as the\nk\n-percent money growth rule. He argued that rules that focused on monetary growth and that eschewed direct feedback on macroeconomic variables would work reasonably well, on average, and avoid the hubris of fine-tuning policy in a dynamic and uncertain world.\nHistory proved Friedman right in his take on the importance of uncertainty, even if his prescription of a\nk\n-percent money growth rule fared less well.\nDuring roughly the same period when Friedman authored his famous presidential address to the American Economic Association disputing the purported long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, William Brainard published an influential paper on the implications of uncertainty. Brainard (1967) argued that uncertainty about the power of monetary policy implied that policy should respond more cautiously to shocks than would be the case if this uncertainty did not exist. Brainard's\nattenuation principle\nis a classic example of what is today known as the Bayesian approach to uncertainty.\n2\nThe Brainard approach to uncertainty consisted of two steps. The first step is to compute the optimal policy for a world without uncertainty; that is, the\ncertainty equivalence\ncase. The second step is to adjust that policy response to account for the particular uncertainty under study. One strand of research followed these steps through the 1970s and beyond.\n3\nA parallel strand of research that embraced at least part of the message of Friedman was also under way. It bypassed the optimal policy benchmark altogether, on the grounds that uncertainty is pervasive, and sought instead to find simple rules that performed well across a large class of models and for a large range of conditions.\nBrainard's insight was important. There are many circumstances in which the principle of gradualism applies, but as I will discuss later, economic research has also found that there are circumstances in which the presence of uncertainty does not warrant a gradual policy response.\nThe 1990s and 2000s\nJumping ahead to the 1990s, a \"new economy\" was emerging. The unemployment rate was below what many analysts at the time judged to be its natural rate, and many FOMC participants and others were forecasting growth above the economy's potential. Chairman Alan Greenspan, however, suspected that technological advances and other forces were fostering a \"new economy\" of sustained high productivity growth that would allow a period of persistently low unemployment without generating inflationary pressure. In the absence of hard evidence to the contrary, he was able to persuade the FOMC to go along with him by implicitly employing the Bayesian logic of Brainard's attenuation principle with a disarmingly simple suggestion: Let's just wait one more meeting and see. Chairman Greenspan repeated this message as inflation fell from above 2 percent in 1996 to below 2 percent in 1997 and 1998 while the economy added 9.3 million jobs, and the FOMC raised the federal funds rate just once.\n4\nAround the same time, there was an explosion of interest in\nsimple policy rules\nfor monetary policy, beginning, in most people's reckoning, with the rule John Taylor (1993) published in the early 1990s. These simple feedback rules, which specify how central banks' policy instrument would respond to the state of the economy, differed from their predecessors by replacing monetary aggregates as the instrument of monetary policy with a short-term policy interest rate. This research embraced the message that restricting feedback to a small number of key macroeconomic variables would result in more robust outcomes than adhering to the prescriptions of, say, optimal-control policies, which in essence imposed feedback on all aspects of these models.\n5\nWhether much of the robustness gains of simple rules can be realized when central banks only use such rules as \"guides\" for monetary policy is a topic worthy of further research.\n6\nThe claimed robustness of simple rules across a set of fixed models is arguably only part of their appeal. Another part is the notion that their parsimony presumably makes simple rules relatively easy for households, businesses, and financial market participants to learn. One useful finding was that gradualism in policy setting, in the form of a sizable weight on the lagged policy rate in the policy rule, is helpful for facilitating learnability.\n7\nIn any event, the literature on learning in macroeconomics extended the dimension of uncertainty for monetary policymakers from the cross section of candidate models to the time dimension of any given model.\nThe bulk of the early literature assumed private-sector decisionmakers were knowledgeable, rational agents, while policymakers lacked detailed knowledge of the structure of the economy. The assumed imbalance of information and knowledge was striking. It was usually assumed, sometimes only implicitly, that private agents understood not only the economic environment in which they operated, but also the policy regime that was in place. Considering this background, some more recent contributions explored two related departures from the assumption of a fixed model with uncertain parameters: time-variation in the true (population) model, and private agents learning about the economy.\nAs I just observed, the rational expectations paradigm presupposes that economic agents have a great deal of knowledge about their environment, but policymakers do not know the true (population) parameters of the models they use. Instead, they must use estimates of those parameters. As Sargent (1993) noted, it makes sense to assume that the decisionmakers within the models that policymakers employ are no more sophisticated than the econometricians who estimate them. Doing so means accepting that the true (population) parameters of one's model could be time varying\u00e2\u0080\u0094the outcome of the interplay between shocks, uncertainty, learning, and policy. That realization changes the way you think about monetary policy.\nHow might this matter? Let me give you one example. As many of you know, econometricians have found sizable declines in recent decades in the response of inflation to the unemployment rate.\n8\nTaken at face value, these declines in the slope of the Phillips curve have important implications for the optimal conduct of monetary policy. But what should policymakers take from such econometric results? Some researchers argue that the apparent decline in the response to slack in the Phillips curve could be a manifestation of the improved control of inflation by the central bank.\n9\nThat is, policymakers could be \"victims of their own success\" in the sense that good performance in controlling inflation over the Great Moderation period may have weakened the information content of the data.\nNow, take this notion a step further, as a strand of the literature does, and suppose that private agents within our models are themselves skeptical\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, that they have doubts about their methods for formulating expectations and making decisions, and that they act accordingly. Economists now have new means of modeling uncertainty both\nwithin\na given model and\nacross\na set of rival models. These methods draw on theories of\nambiguity aversion\n.\n10\nUnder ambiguity aversion, agents are particularly concerned about types of uncertainties that do not lend themselves to being represented in terms of probabilities. Agents' choices are motivated, in part, by an incentive to minimize the adverse consequences of these types of uncertainties. The ambiguity aversion approach to uncertainty suggests that to protect against uncertainty over which a policymaker is unwilling or unable to attach prior probabilities, the appropriate response is often anti-attenuation; that is, policy should apply\nstronger\nmonetary medicine than in the certainty equivalence case.\nFor the reasons I have outlined, there are circumstances when uncertainty might appropriately induce a gradual response and other circumstances when a nongradual response to uncertainty may be justified. Furthermore, under either the Bayesian approach or the ambiguity aversion approach, the best response to uncertainty is context specific and can vary over time.\n11\nSometimes the context leads to the same conclusion, broadly speaking, regardless of the approach. One case of perennial interest to central bankers is inflation persistence where the Bayesian approach, the ambiguity aversion approach, and its close cousin, robust control, all tend to lead to policy that is stronger than the certainty equivalent case to forestall the possibility of inflationary forces becoming embedded in inflation expectations.\n12\nAnother case is that of crisis periods.\nThe Global Financial Crisis\nTake, for example, the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. During this period, the tension between caution, on the one hand, and vigorous action, on the other, as a way to conduct monetary policy in the face of uncertainty was evident. In September 2007, the FOMC decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to \"forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets\" and noted that \"developments in financial markets since the Committee's last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook.\"\n13\nIn subsequent meetings, the FOMC gradually lowered its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points and, in January 2008, decided to quicken its pace by lowering the target by 75 basis points in an unscheduled meeting and by 50 basis points, 75 basis points, and 25 basis points in subsequent meetings. Inflation, however, was rising over that period. By June 2008, it was well over 2 percent and still increasing, and the FOMC paused its rate cutting. It was a decision that weighed the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations with the downside risks to economic growth.\n14\nIn September 2008, the circumstances changed precipitously, as did the FOMC's approach to policy. The Committee quickly cut the federal funds rate effectively to zero and took extraordinary steps to stabilize the financial system and support the economy. The motivation to respond assertively to the emerging crisis, and the uncertainty surrounding it, was no doubt accentuated by the knowledge that future policy actions might be circumscribed by a lengthy spell of the funds rate at its lower bound, which would magnify losses associated with adverse outcomes.\n15\nMy conclusion, as Chair Powell mentioned in a speech in 2018, is that during crisis periods, words like \"we will do whatever it takes\" will likely be more effective than \"we will take cautious steps.\"\n16\nLessons Learned\nSome clear lessons flow from the history that I have summarized. First, when uncertainty is high, policymakers should sometimes act quickly and should sometimes act cautiously. The right action depends on the circumstances. Second, while simple monetary policy rules are appealing for several reasons, rigid adherence to the prescriptions of simple rules is unwarranted. Historically, policymakers have only used rules as \"guides\" or benchmarks in setting policy, and there are good reasons for this. It is clearly beneficial to look at the totality of the data to identify changes in the economy in real time, to embrace the risk-management considerations associated with uncertainty that factor into FOMC decisions, and to adapt policy to the evolution of the economy. Third, in the presence of a high degree of uncertainly, policymakers benefit from a healthy dose of humility. There are limits to what we know about the economy, especially after periods of economic upheaval such as a pandemic.\nCurrent Situation\nReflecting on the situation we are facing today, over the past year, inflation has come down significantly but is still running above the FOMC's 2 percent goal. In March, headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation was 2.7 percent over the past 12 months based on the Federal Reserve's staff estimates. A year earlier, it was 4.4 percent. Core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, stood at 2.8 percent; a year ago, it was 4.8 percent. While we have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation, the job of sustainably restoring 2 percent inflation is not yet done.\nReal GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 3.4 percent, and I expect first-quarter ",

Bowman\nAt \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrameworks for Monetary Policy, Regulation, and Bank Capital\u00e2\u0080\u009d Spring 2024 Meeting of the Shadow Open Market Committee, hosted by the Manhattan Institute, New York, New York\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you for the invitation to speak to the Shadow Open Market Committee (SOMC).\n1\nThe SOMC has a distinguished reputation for fostering substantive analysis and debate regarding independent, transparent, and systematic approaches to central bank policymaking. It's a pleasure to join you today and to discuss some of the current issues facing central banks and monetary policymakers.\nIn my remarks today, I will review some of the notable developments in the U.S. economy and financial system\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as review key monetary policy actions and communications\u00e2\u0080\u0094since I joined the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and became a permanent voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in late November 2018. As I look back over these five-plus years, I will consider how a range of uncertainties and risks regarding the macroeconomy and its measurement have affected monetary policy decisions and communications. I will also highlight some considerations regarding financial stability risks and monetary policy. I will conclude with my own views on the near-term economic outlook, some of the prominent risks and uncertainties surrounding my outlook, and my views on the implications for monetary policy.\nSetting Monetary Policy amid a Wide Range of Uncertainties and Risks\nAn omni-present challenge monetary policymakers face is how to account for uncertainties surrounding the current state of the economy and the economic outlook when setting monetary policy. Macroeconomic models that can help guide the setting of monetary policy often invoke unobservable concepts such as the natural rate of unemployment, potential output, or the neutral real interest rate. These unobservable concepts can be estimated but only with a considerable degree of uncertainty, and the estimates may vary over time\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, because of structural changes in the economy. Macroeconomic models are also subject to uncertainty, since they must make simplifying assumptions regarding the complex set of relationships and interactions among households, businesses, governments, and the financial system that also evolve and change. Moreover, the data that are used to estimate model parameters and to formulate the economic outlook are inherently uncertain and are often revised as the statistical agencies refine their estimates or gather more information.\nIn addition to uncertainties surrounding macroeconomic models and measurement, there are a number of risks that, if realized, could shock the economy and financial system, making it more difficult for policymakers to confidently assess the economy and the economic outlook. Despite these challenges, monetary policymaking requires a forward-looking approach, since its actions affect the economy, labor markets, and inflation with a lag.\n2\nThe post\u00e2\u0080\u0093financial crisis economy and monetary policy at the zero lower bound\nWhen I joined the FOMC in late 2018, despite nearly a decade of accommodative monetary policy following the financial crisis and subsequent recession, one of the primary concerns was that inflation had persistently been running slightly below the Committee's 2 percent inflation target. There was a recognition that the \"natural rate of unemployment\" may have been lower than many on the FOMC had estimated, and that inflation may have become less responsive to reductions in the unemployment rate.\n3\nThis recognition meant that preemptive increases in the federal funds rate based on expected reductions in the unemployment rate alone may not have been needed to keep inflation and inflation expectations aligned with the Committee's 2 percent target.\nA central topic of FOMC meeting discussions throughout 2019 was how monetary policy strategies and tools could best achieve the Committee's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment when structurally low interest rates and disinflationary forces kept inflation persistently under the Committee's inflation target. There was also a concern that the federal funds rate, the FOMC's key policy rate, was too close to the \"zero lower bound.\" And that this proximity could limit the Committee's ability to respond effectively to an adverse shock by using our primary monetary policy tool of lowering the target range for the federal funds rate. More broadly, many central banks around the world were grappling with the prospect of structurally lower interest rates due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes and higher savings rates, lower potential output and productivity growth, and greater investor demand for safe assets like Treasury securities.\nAt the time, the FOMC assessed that downward risks to both employment and inflation were likely to remain prominent due to the proximity of interest rates to the zero lower bound. In August 2020, the FOMC significantly revised its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy to reflect this assessment.\n4\nA notable change relative to the initial statement adopted in 2012 was a change in the language addressing how the FOMC would conduct monetary policy. The new statement noted that the Committee would seek \"to mitigate\nshortfalls\n[emphasis added]\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094rather than \"deviations\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"of employment from the Committee's assessment of its maximum level and deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal.\"\n5\nBy replacing the word \"deviations\" with \"shortfalls\" when describing employment and the Committee's reaction to changes in employment relative to estimates of its maximum level, the Committee indicated that it would not act preemptively to curb inflation based only on the perception of labor market tightness.\nAnother notable change to the strategy statement was the adoption of what some refer to as \"asymmetric flexible average inflation targeting\" or \"temporary price level targeting.\"\n6\nSpecifically, the new statement noted that \"in order to anchor longer-term inflation expectations at [its 2 percent goal], the Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\"\n7\nThe revisions to the FOMC's statement focused on monetary policy in a world of structurally low interest rates, disinflationary forces, and an apparent insensitivity of inflation to low levels of unemployment. Although the revised statement reaffirmed the commitment to the Committee's inflation target, it did not describe how the Committee would respond if inflation were to run persistently\nabove\nits 2 percent goal.\n8\nGiven the timing of its implementation, the revised strategy guided how the FOMC responded to one of the largest shocks experienced by the U.S. economy in recent years\u00e2\u0080\u0094the COVID-19 pandemic. This shock\u00e2\u0080\u0094combined with the policy responses of governments and central banks around the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094disrupted many of the dynamics that had influenced the economy over the previous several decades and the post\u00e2\u0080\u00932008 financial crisis approach to monetary policy. These impacts will affect how we think about monetary policy going forward, but let's first put the COVID-19 event and response into better context.\nThe COVID-19 shock and monetary policy response\nToward the latter part of the FOMC's monetary policy framework review, in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented shock to the global economy and financial system. Widespread economic lockdowns and social distancing, combined with other pandemic effects, caused the swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic activity since the Great Depression. Many critical parts of the U.S. financial system experienced significant disruption or completely ceased to function. The Federal Reserve responded forcefully to mitigate the financial market turmoil and the economic effects of the rapid shutdown of the U.S. economy (and I'll have more to say on this topic later).\nAs a part of its response, the FOMC quickly lowered the target range for the federal funds rate back to 0 to 1/4 percent and began purchasing large amounts of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities. These purchases were initially designed to support the smooth functioning of securities markets and the flow of credit to businesses and households. Later, the purchases provided additional monetary policy accommodation to support economic activity and labor markets.\n9\nFollowing the return to the zero lower bound, in addition to conducting asset purchases, the FOMC used forward guidance to provide additional monetary policy accommodation to keep both short- and longer-term interest rates low. In its March 15, 2020, statement, the FOMC noted that it expected to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent \"until it [was] confident that the economy [had] weathered recent events and [was] on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.\"\n10\nFollowing the release of the revised framework in August 2020, the FOMC revised the forward guidance in its September post-meeting statement to be more explicitly outcome-based to state that the target range would remain at 0 to 1/4 percent \"until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\"\n11\nIn its December 2020 post-meeting statement, the FOMC added forward guidance regarding its asset purchases by noting that it expected that the current pace of asset purchases would continue until \"substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.\"\n12\nThis explicit outcome-based forward guidance, like the revised monetary policy framework, was very focused on supporting the economy following the COVID-19 shock amid the risks of persistently low inflation and disinflationary forces with structurally low interest rates. The guidance was also quite restrictive in the criteria for slowing the pace of asset purchases, especially since the FOMC would stop asset purchases before it would raise the federal funds rate.\n13\nOne could argue the December forward guidance made it much more difficult for the FOMC to react to new information suggesting that risks and uncertainties had evolved in response to pandemic-related changes in the economy. Other uncertainties such as the accuracy of real-time economic measurements also presented challenges, as did significant supply-side disruptions and the uncertainty about the timing of progress toward their resolution, which I will discuss next.\nThe post-pandemic economy, the resurgence of inflation, and the rapid tightening in monetary policy\nIn the early phases of the pandemic, fiscal authorities around the world implemented support programs for labor markets and households and businesses.\n14\nThese generous policies, combined with very accommodative monetary policies, bolstered private-sector and state and local government balance sheets. In particular, they led to what has come to be known as \"excess savings\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094above-normal household savings from extraordinary levels of fiscal support and a limited ability to freely spend it due to economic lockdowns, supply chain disruptions, and other pandemic- and recession-related factors.\nIn 2021, novel medical treatments, reduced social distancing, and innovative business approaches in adapting to the restrictive pandemic environment led to a sharp economic rebound. Strong demand (supported by stimulative fiscal and monetary policies), a reduced labor supply (due in part to early retirements, childcare responsibilities, and concerns about COVID-19), and a mismatch between available jobs and workers all contributed to a very tight labor market. The unusually rapid rebound in economic activity, pandemic-driven shift to consumer goods spending, supply chain fragilities, and manufacturing component shortages led to crippling bottlenecks for a number of industries. These supply and demand imbalances, likely amplified by fiscal and monetary policies, led to a sharp rise in inflation over a period of just a few months.\nBy the second half of 2021, inflationary pressures intensified and became more broad- based. Labor markets were extremely tight, though it was difficult to assess the true extent of tightness, given the decrease in labor force participation and mixed data signals at the time, which all were later revised. Of the many difficult issues the Committee faced, one of the most important was whether inflation would persist or would resolve as supply-side issues eventually eased.\nThe September 2021 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed the median FOMC expectation for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation of 4.2 percent at the end of 2021, largely reflecting high inflation readings in the first half of 2021. But for year-end 2022, the median expectation was for PCE inflation to decline to 2.2 percent.\n15\nPrivate-sector forecasters expected higher inflation of 5.1 percent at year-end 2021 but also projected a slowing to just over 2 percent by the end of 2022.\n16\nWith the benefit of hindsight, we now know that most forecasters, ourselves included, vastly misjudged the persistence of inflation at that time, with 5.9 percent PCE inflation for both 2021 and 2022. This example underscores the challenge we faced in identifying which factors were driving inflation and how long those forces would persist.\nIn the second half of 2021, it became clear that the FOMC's monetary policy stance was too accommodative in the presence of growing inflationary pressures and that the Committee needed to move toward a tighter policy stance. It seems likely to me that the experience of the years leading up to the pandemic, when inflation was persistently low, made it hard for many to foresee how quickly that situation could change. Of course, the inflation and labor data did not accurately reflect the economic conditions prevailing at the time and were subsequently substantially revised.\n17\nTogether, these factors, combined with the FOMC's forward guidance discussed earlier, contributed to a delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021.\nThe shift in the Committee's forward guidance toward the end of 2021 and in early 2022 was effective in moving longer-dated interest rates higher and in tightening financial c",

Kugler\nAt Women in Economics Symposium, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri\nShare\nThank you, President Musalem, and many congratulations on the start of your new position here at the St. Louis Fed. We are all so happy to have you as part of the Federal Reserve System, and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak here today.\n1\nI will start with the issue that has brought us here\u00e2\u0080\u0094why it is so important for women to be a full and equitably represented part of the economics profession. There are, of course, moral reasons for economics to reflect the values of our democratic society\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is the right thing to do. But there are eminently practical reasons as well. Economics favors the productive utilization of resources, and bringing more women into the profession obviously makes better use of the talents and efforts of more than half of the population. Greater diversity in a workforce yields better ideas and greater productivity, and the field of economics has certainly been enriched by these contributions.\nBut today, I would like to focus on the benefits of greater representation of women that accrue to economic research and policymaking\u00e2\u0080\u0094the way that you can make economic analysis more constructive and relevant. In a broad sense, different experiences and perspectives among those engaged in any social science should provide better insights about how people think and act. But I would like to take this point a step further and connect this issue of representation to the ways in which we approach economic research. In particular, I will describe how my own personal experience has been an important tool for me to use, in combination with the more familiar and rigorous tools of the economist, in ways that I believe have strengthened my research. In doing so, I also hope to show that personal experience can be used by you and others in our profession to provide deeper insights about the questions we grapple with. If this is true, it would constitute another way in which greater representation of women\u00e2\u0080\u0094and others with underrepresented backgrounds\u00e2\u0080\u0094will increase and enhance the valuable contributions that economics makes to society.\nIn my discussion, I will refer to some of my own past research to illustrate my general approach to economics. Importantly, though, my comments today are only illustrative of a general approach and are not commentary on any specific policy questions.\nIn explaining how I let personal experience and rigorous economic methodology inform each other, I am going to employ, in a somewhat casual way, two words that you may be familiar with. I think of a \"deductive\" approach as beginning with or relying on theory or general observations and then using data or qualitative evidence to verify those ideas in specific settings. For me, an \"inductive\" approach means beginning with personal experience and specific evidence from a particular context and then moving to more general lessons that we can draw on as economists about given issues or topics. In my career, I have found it fruitful to employ both of these approaches at different times, and often in succession or in alternation, to move from the specific to the general, developing a theory and then sometimes using specifics to test that theory.\nLet me start with a little personal background, since that helped form my approach to research. I was born in the U.S. but grew up in Colombia. While there, my parents and I traveled around the country, where I observed a broad range of social problems: poverty, homelessness, child labor, and a lack of access to health care and other basic necessities. As a child, when you see suffering to this extent, you wonder about why and how it is occurring. Later, as an undergraduate, I found that economics offered tools that could help society understand and, I hoped, address some of these problems. What I started to see, and then saw more over time, was that in many ways the different social problems I observed were closely related to the opportunities people have to work and earn an income that reflects their effort and productivity as workers\u00e2\u0080\u0094in short, issues at the heart of labor economics. It also turned out that the tools of economics\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, math and statistical analysis\u00e2\u0080\u0094were well suited to studying these questions and helped ground my work in objective reality. So I developed these skills by pursuing a Ph.D. in economics. During my career, I have conducted research on a range of topics, including labor markets, productivity, and social safety nets. And, as I will show, I have employed both the inductive and the deductive approaches that I have described here to formulate economic questions, rigorously examine data and evidence, and then test my conclusions.\nThe first example I want to share with you is a paper I wrote with Scott Imberman and Bruce Sacerdote on the relocation of families displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n2\nIn 2005, I was a professor of economics at the University of Houston, in a city that was a major destination for people forced to evacuate from New Orleans and the surrounding area because of the hurricanes that year. Of the million people displaced by the hurricanes in 2005, Houston received 75,000 evacuees, many of them school-age children.\nHouston was a fast-growing city with schools that already faced challenges, so people had questions about what effect this influx of new students might have on our local schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094now stretched for resources\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the students already attending them. It mattered to me as a member of the community with my own children attending those schools. Fortunately, economics provided tools to explore this question.\nThe question we considered was about \"peer effects\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094does the performance of your peers affect your own performance in school? How will students coming from other schools affect the outcomes for those already in Houston? The research literature showed some evidence of an effect, but the results were mixed. It is easy to imagine some reasons why peers could matter. A key challenge was that, even if we could find a relationship between the outcomes of the existing Houston students and their peers from Louisiana, that would not prove that the new students \"caused\" the outcomes of the existing Houston students. Classmates in the same classes with similar backgrounds could have similar outcomes for lots of reasons. But in this case, these new peers did not choose to attend certain schools based on pre-existing trends but instead were assigned to schools based on their shelter location, which is basically a random assignment\u00e2\u0080\u0094highly conducive to estimating causal effects. And the magnitude of this particular event was large enough to provide lots of variation in the composition of peers. I consider the approach we took to designing this study a good example of the power of deductive reasoning\u00e2\u0080\u0094developing a hypothesis and then finding the data by which to test it.\nBut we didn't just think about the data we started with. We had lots of discussions with school administrators and teachers. What they had to say about their experiences led us to explore ways in which the new students were affecting the existing ones, beyond grades and test scores\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, behavior in schools and absenteeism. As any parent of school-age kids can tell you, these are obvious and significant factors in how students learn, and these discussions resonated for me as a parent with kids in school. My co-authors and I knew we had to make this part of our research.\nOur basic approach in this paper was to relate changes in student outcomes with the prevalence of evacuee children in their district, controlling for a rich set of factors. Our conclusions were that in Houston, a large influx of evacuees did not generally have a large effect on test performance of local students. We did detect some negative effects in some subgroups, particularly in math. Motivated by discussions with teachers and administrators, we also found some small negative effects on attendance and behavior. Using traditional methods in economics, we conducted a number of what economists call \"robustness checks,\" making sure that our assumption that the relocating families weren't picking school districts based on pre-existing trends held up, trying different ways of measuring outcomes or specifying models, and attempting to exclude alternative explanations, such as changes in teacher quality or educational resources.\nUsing these familiar methods, we had found that Houston schools were able to absorb the new students with little aggregate effect on local students. But that finding sent us back to think about the theories we had developed at the start of the project and the different reasons that make peers relevant to a student. In a sense, now that we had some results, what had started as a deductive analysis turned into an inductive one. And by examining the data more thoroughly, we discovered that a crucial factor in determining the impact of peers on academic outcomes was the extent to which students are grouped and interact with classmates of a similar academic ability level. Adding this dimension to our research, we found that peer effects were, in fact, stronger among cohorts of students with similar academic ability. It is a nuance to our overall finding of little significant effect and a result that I suspect would not have been attainable without the personal experience that I brought to the project as a parent\u00e2\u0080\u0094one of the factors that had motivated the work in the first place.\nLet me offer a second example of this \"inductive\" approach, based on personal experience, and the interaction with a \"deductive\" approach that resulted in research that I am particularly proud of. As I said earlier, I taught at the University of Houston, a great school that has a very diverse student body, with people from all walks of life and at different stages of their lives. There were a lot of commuters, many still living at home with parents. There were also a lot of actual parents in my classes and people who had to work full-time jobs while completing their education. I once had a student who needed to reschedule a final exam because she had to go to court to fight for custody of her child. I had students who struggled to secure childcare to attend class, others who struggled with access to transportation to and from campus. The hurdles they often had to overcome were daunting. And while many obtained loans and other tuition assistance, the challenges they faced were multidimensional, and I often found myself thinking that their education would be much more successful if they had support in other areas of their lives.\nI had written two papers on a training program in Colombia that included a stipend for workers.\n3\nThe stipend was intended to subsidize transportation for workers, with an extra amount for women that was intended to supplement their costs for childcare. The results found a significant boost to wages and employment from the training program, especially for women, and we found that the gains stayed with those workers for over a decade after the program. Moreover, we also found that the program encouraged workers and even their relatives to pursue more formal schooling\u00e2\u0080\u0094high school and even college. But these papers didn't allow me to explore the separate contribution of the stipend to the wage, employment, and educational gains we found. My own experience with students at the University of Houston suggested that this more comprehensive support for the workers in training was important, so I decided to follow up on my research.\nSo I wrote another paper\u00e2\u0080\u0094jointly with Felipe Barrera-Osorio and Mikko Silliman\u00e2\u0080\u0094based on an experiment we conducted in collaboration with a training program.\n4\nIn this experiment, we randomly offered stipends to some but not all workers. Students might use the stipend to pay for transportation to and from the program, or perhaps to help cover meals during the program, depending on what they saw as their most pressing needs. I like to call this a form of \"wraparound\" support; the stipend wraps around the main program to make it easier for people to participate. Some workers accepted to the training program were put in a class that focused on technical skills, and others in a class emphasizing social skills\u00e2\u0080\u0094again using random assignment. We found that participants saw an increase in employment, hours worked, and wages relative to workers who did not take the program, and the effects were greatest for women. Labor market outcomes improved more for those who received technical skills training, though this difference diminished after less than a year. And, lastly, we found that the effects of the program were indeed magnified by the stipend program. The \"wraparound\" support enhanced the value of the training program and likely helped mitigate the other labor market challenges faced by participants.\nThis paper again shows how insights gained from personal experience, combined with the deductive methods and tools of economics, can be the basis for good research. As I suspected from my experience with my University of Houston students, providing education is more effective, and the returns are higher, when students have some \"wraparound\" support that makes their lives a bit easier. We took this inductive approach and demonstrated it using standard tools of economics\u00e2\u0080\u0094randomization in a carefully designed experiment.\nAnd this approach continued in my past work as a policymaker. At the U.S. Department of Labor and at the World Bank, I confronted questions that resonated for me with experiences I had had and earlier applied in my work as a researcher. At the Labor Department, I worked on workforce development issues, and we were able to include access to more comprehensive \"wraparound\" services to promote strong take-up and retention in these programs. When I was advocating for this approach, I thought about my students in Houston and those workers in Colombia, all of them trying to overcome big challenges and build a better life. And I was grateful then, and I'm grateful now, for my personal experiences, which didn't come from a textbook or a lecture but helped open my eyes to the answers to some of the important questions that economics strives to answer.\nThe research and policy work I have just described predate my time as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, and the policies I studied then are outside the purview of my current role. But I continue to apply the general approach of bringing my own experience, and the experiences I hear from others, together with the rigorous tools of economic",

Kugler\nAt the Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy, Washington University in St. Louis,  St. Louis, Missouri\nShare\nWatch Live\nThank you, Andrew, and thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.\n1\nI am very pleased to be talking here at the Weidenbaum Center. As an economist currently working on policy, but with a long trajectory in research, I particularly appreciate the center's multidisciplinary approach to building bridges between these two applications of economics.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been working to lower inflation in the context of our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. Today I will discuss economic developments in the U.S. and how I view the current stance of monetary policy in light of recent data and longer-run trends. Since I am an economist, you will not be surprised that I will talk about recent economic developments by highlighting the dynamics of supply and demand.\nAs you all know, inflation began to rise in 2021. By mid-2022, 12-month inflation, based on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, was around 7 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0094much too high and far above the FOMC's 2 percent longer-run objective. But since that time, PCE inflation has slowed significantly, declining to 5.4 percent at the end of 2022, then to 2.6 percent at the end of 2023, and then to 2.5 percent in February.\nInflation can sometimes be hard to read from overall PCE inflation figures due to the volatility of food and energy prices. For that reason, it is sometimes helpful to focus on \"core\" PCE inflation, which excludes those categories and is a better guide to the direction of inflation. Core PCE inflation peaked at a rate above 5-1/2 percent in early 2022 but fell rapidly during 2023. In fact, the core PCE disinflation we saw last year was the fastest since the early 1980s. The progress has sometimes been bumpy from month to month, and, indeed, January and February of this year showed a bit of firming in the inflation data. But the January numbers, in particular, featured some atypical or seasonal factors that suggest a need to withhold judgment. The 12-month core PCE rate now stands at 2.8 percent. That rate represents considerable progress, but it is still meaningfully above the FOMC's 2 percent target.\nI like to think about core PCE inflation in terms of three main components: goods, housing services, and non-housing services. Twelve-month inflation for core goods peaked first, reaching about 7-1/2 percent in early 2022. But goods inflation cooled quickly, and in February goods prices were nearly half a percentage point below their level a year ago. Services inflation peaked later and has cooled less quickly. Within services, housing services\u00e2\u0080\u0094a measure of the cost of rent, and the equivalent for owner-occupied housing\u00e2\u0080\u0094rose above 8 percent early last year but was 5.8 percent in February. Housing services inflation is naturally persistent because tenant rents often have year-long lease agreements, and estimates of owner-occupied housing costs are imputed based in large part using those tenant rents. Data on new tenant rent agreements suggest that housing inflation broadly will continue to cool. Finally, inflation in core non-housing services hovered between 4-1/2 and 5-1/2 percent from mid-2021 through mid-2023 but began cooling after that, reaching 3.3 percent in February. Continued disinflation will indeed require further progress in housing and non-housing services.\nThe rise and subsequent easing of inflation in recent years were related to both supply and demand factors. This development has been confirmed by granular, \"bottom-up\" statistical research looking at price and quantity changes within narrow product categories. Roughly speaking, if a price goes up while quantity goes down, that is an indication that a negative supply shock is dominating; if price and quantity move in the same direction, that is an indication that a demand shock is dominating. Research using this method finds that, for the economy broadly, demand shocks accounted for roughly two-thirds of the 2021 pickup in, and 2023 slowing of, core PCE inflation, with the remaining one-third related to supply. The role of supply is somewhat larger in a narrower analysis focused on the domestic manufacturing sector.\n2\n\"Top-down\" research looking at aggregate time-series data also found significant contributions for both supply and demand factors.\n3\nLet me be a bit more concrete about this point by discussing supply and demand for goods and services in turn. Supply in some goods-producing industries, like motor vehicles, was held down for some time by pandemic-related plant shutdowns, shortages, and transportation bottlenecks. And demand for goods surged during the pandemic when consumers shied away from in-person services. Businesses frequently highlighted shortages of materials as having held down production during the period when supply was tight and demand was strong. Those pressures have eased considerably (though perhaps not completely). Supply chains and production have largely recovered, and there are signs that goods demand growth since then has eased. For example, the share of consumer spending devoted to goods rather than services has moved back closer to its pre-pandemic trend after rising sharply in 2020.\nRegarding services, particularly non-housing services, the most important input to services production tends to be labor.\n4\nFor that reason, it is useful to talk about supply and demand for labor. Labor supply was held down significantly in the early stages of the pandemic as workers voluntarily and, in some cases, involuntarily stayed out of the workforce. Older workers, in particular, left the labor force in a wave of early retirements, and, tragically, COVID\u00e2\u0080\u009119 caused a rise in mortality. Additionally, many prime-age workers\u00e2\u0080\u0094those between the ages of 25 and 54\u00e2\u0080\u0094stayed out of the labor market for a time, perhaps because of health concerns or family care challenges. And immigration was relatively low during the pandemic.\nBut labor supply has been recovering. While most older individuals have not, as a whole, returned to the labor force, many prime-age workers have. Prime-age women, in particular, have significantly increased their labor force participation, which reached an all-time high last year and remains close to that all-time high. Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that net immigration increased to above 2-1/2 million in 2022 and 3-1/2 million in 2023. If the CBO analysis is correct, population growth has been a sizable contributor to overall labor force growth.\nA more subtle source of labor supply improvement has been improved quality of matches between workers and firms\u00e2\u0080\u0094how well suited particular workers are, by talent, experience, and preferences, to their employers. In the wake of, and until the end of, the pandemic, we saw a heightened pace of workers quitting their jobs and finding new ones, a process that economists generally believe improves matches. Indeed, evidence suggests workers and firms have been fairly efficient at finding each other over the past couple of years.\n5\nHigh-quality job matches act like additional labor supply: Both firms and workers are likely to be more productive when workers' skills and preferences are a good match for their employers' needs.\nOn the demand side, labor demand was strong in 2021 and 2022. Demand was so strong, in fact, that the job openings rate\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, the monthly number of job openings relative to total employment\u00e2\u0080\u0094ran almost 50 percent above its pre-pandemic record all the way from July 2021 through July 2022.\n6\nBut the job openings rate has declined roughly 30 percent from its peak, a sign that labor demand\u00e2\u0080\u0094while still robust\u00e2\u0080\u0094has cooled significantly. So the labor market has moved into better balance.\nImportantly, given the strong labor supply growth, supply\u00e2\u0080\u0093demand imbalances can continue to ease even amid a solid pace of net job growth, as we have been seeing. Indeed, I suspect that strong population growth helps resolve the puzzle that forecasters have faced over the past year, in which measures of labor market growth\u00e2\u0080\u0094and growth of other economic variables, like consumption\u00e2\u0080\u0094have been solid even amid easing inflation.\n7\nAs labor markets have moved into better balance, wage growth has cooled\u00e2\u0080\u0094which means that increases in the main cost business in the services sector have slowed, easing inflationary pressures. Workers and families do not reap the benefit of higher wages if those gains are eaten up by inflation. For that reason, it is important that wage growth be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. The U.S. economy is moving back toward that kind of wage growth, including in services industries: The 12-month growth of average hourly earnings in private services has come down to about 4 percent from a peak pace above 6 percent in early 2022. And despite the cooling of wage growth, with inflation easing over the past year, we have seen broader wage increases again outpacing price gains, that is, real wage gains.\nBut you may ask: What role has the FOMC played in all of this? While supply conditions are beyond the control of monetary policymakers, the FOMC can influence the pace of inflation by tightening monetary policy to slow the growth of aggregate demand. The FOMC began raising its policy interest rate in early 2022 and proceeded expeditiously. These actions have damped aggregate demand, with the most pronounced effects on interest rate\u00e2\u0080\u0093sensitive sectors. For example, in 2023, the level of residential investment was about 19 percent below its 2021 level, reflecting a much lower pace of home purchases. And business investment in machines has seen somewhat tepid growth lately, even contracting a bit last year, though I note that the construction of new factories has been surging, perhaps partly related to recent legislation, which will boost supply over the longer run. More broadly, financial conditions have been a drag on aggregate demand, as suggested by the Federal Reserve Board's FCI-G (Financial Conditions Impulse on Growth) index, which estimates the overall effect on gross domestic product (GDP) of changes in financial conditions, including interest rates, asset prices, and exchange rates. This measure moved well into restrictive territory in mid-2022 and remained quite restrictive for some time, though it has become less restrictive recently.\nIn addition to the direct actions taken to tighten monetary policy, the FOMC has also helped cool inflation through its communication with the public. In particular, the FOMC's stated commitment to bring inflation back to 2 percent, coupled with its actions to tighten policy, has helped ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, that households and firms believe that inflation will return to the Committee's target. Anchored expectations are evident in surveys of consumers conducted by the University of Michigan and the New York Fed. Separately, a Richmond Fed survey shows a close relation between firms' expectations of overall inflation and their own price-setting plans. As the effects of earlier supply and demand shocks fade, firms with anchored inflation expectations will bring their price-setting decisions back into alignment with the FOMC's inflation target. One way they might do so is by adjusting their prices less frequently. Before the pandemic, the typical price lasted more than 10 months, but by early 2022, it was lasting fewer than 5 months while inflation was near its recent peak. Since then, the frequency of price adjustments has slowed considerably, and by the fourth quarter of last year, the typical price was lasting more than 7 months.\n8\nLet me now turn to the outlook for this year. Given my thinking about the role of supply and demand in recent inflation dynamics, as well as the role anchored inflation expectations are playing in bringing price-setting behavior back to normal, I expect the disinflationary trend to continue.\nThere is still a bit of room for further supply improvement, especially in the services sector, where solid labor supply growth will continue to ease wage and inflation pressures.\nOn the demand side, I expect consumption growth to slow some this year, as households have drawn down large balances of excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and are facing restrictive financial conditions. We may already be seeing some of that slowing; consumer spending was soft in January and February, on average, suggesting that we are on track for lower consumption growth in the first quarter than we saw during the second half of last year.\nWith less support from consumers, I expect GDP growth this year to be solid but slower than last year's strong 3.1 percent pace. Even with demand growth cooling, given the backdrop of solid supply, my baseline expectation is that further disinflation can be accomplished without a significant rise in unemployment.\nThat said, the future is uncertain, and I am attentive to risks\u00e2\u0080\u0094both upside risks to my inflation outlook and downside risks to the outlook for economic activity. For upside risks, global developments such as the wars in Europe and the Middle East could spark an increase in commodity prices or further disruptions to shipping networks. The tragic recent bridge collapse in Baltimore and effects on the Port of Baltimore could also pose some risk, though it appears that shipping networks are adapting. Additionally, consumption growth could turn out to be stronger than expected, particularly because of the wage gains we have seen across all income groups\u00e2\u0080\u0094but especially among the lowest earners who have an especially high propensity to spend out of their income.\n9\nIndeed, consumption was surprisingly strong last year and made solid contributions to GDP growth in the third and fourth quarters, though some of that strength may have been related to strong population growth which, more generally, was likely disinflationary.\nBut there are also downside risks to economic activity. Measures of consumer credit delinquencies have been on the rise, which might point to a more significant slowing of consumer spending than expected. And labor markets can sometimes deteriorate very quickly, without much warning in closely watched spending data. The February employment report featured a rise in the unemployment rate, half of which was accounted for by layoffs. I study a range of layoff indicators, both in the official data and in measures based on information contained in publicly traded firms' earnings reports or Google searches, and I will continue to watch a whole range of",

Powell\nAt the Stanford Business, Government, and Society Forum, Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California\nShare\nWatch Live\nIt is a pleasure to be here today. I will begin with the economy and the road ahead for monetary policy before briefly discussing the Federal Reserve's monetary policy independence.\nOver the past year, inflation has come down significantly but is still running above the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent goal. In February, headline inflation was 2.5 percent over the past 12 months based on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. A year earlier, it was 5.2 percent. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, stood at 2.8 percent; a year ago, it was 4.8 percent. While this progress is welcome, the job of sustainably restoring 2 percent inflation is not yet done.\nTight monetary policy continues to weigh on demand, particularly in interest-sensitive spending categories.\nNonetheless, growth in economic activity and employment was strong in 2023, as real gross domestic product expanded more than 3 percent and 3 million jobs were created, even as inflation fell substantially. This combination of outcomes reflects significant improvements in supply that offset to some extent the effects on demand of tighter financial conditions. The healing of global supply chains helped address pent-up demand for goods, particularly in sectors that had faced considerable shortages, such as autos. In addition, labor supply increased significantly, thanks to rising participation among 25-to-54-year-olds, as well as a strong pace of immigration.\nRecent readings on both job gains and inflation have come in higher than expected. The economy added an average of 265,000 jobs per month in the three months through February, a faster pace than we have seen since last June. And the higher inflation data over January and February were above the low readings in the second half of last year.\nThe recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path. Labor market rebalancing is evident in data on quits, job openings, surveys of employers and workers, and the continued gradual decline in wage growth. On inflation, it is too soon to say whether the recent readings represent more than just a bump. We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2 percent. Given the strength of the economy and progress on inflation so far, we have time to let the incoming data guide our decisions on policy.\nWe have held our policy rate at its current level since last July. As shown in the individual projections the FOMC released two weeks ago, my colleagues and I continue to believe that the policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle. If the economy evolves broadly as we expect, most FOMC participants see it as likely to be appropriate to begin lowering the policy rate at some point this year.\nOf course, the outlook is still quite uncertain, and we face risks on both sides. Reducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent. But easing policy too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. As progress on inflation continues and labor market tightness eases, these risks continue to move into better balance.\nAs conditions evolve, monetary policy is well positioned to confront either of these risks. We are making decisions meeting by meeting, and we will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThat brings me to my second topic. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094maximum employment and stable prices. Our success in delivering on these goals matters a great deal to all Americans. To support our pursuit of those goals, Congress granted the Fed a substantial degree of independence in our conduct of monetary policy. Fed policymakers serve long terms that are not synchronized with election cycles. Our decisions are not subject to reversal by other parts of the government, other than through legislation. This independence both enables and requires us to make our monetary policy decisions without consideration of short-term political matters. Such independence for a federal agency is and should be rare. In the case of the Fed, independence is essential to our ability to serve the public. The record shows that independent central banks deliver better economic outcomes.\n1\nWe recognize that we need to continually earn this grant of independence, and we do so by carrying out our work with technical competence and objectivity, in a transparent and accountable manner, and by sticking to our knitting.\nBy technical competence, I mean that Fed policymakers use the most up-to-date information and research to deepen our understanding of the ever-evolving economy and to reliably deliver on our assigned goals. We are supported by a highly capable staff. We also draw on the insights and experiences of a wide array of business, academic, community, and labor leaders, as well as others engaged in the economy. And by objective, I mean that our analysis is free from any personal or political bias, in service to the public. We will not always get it right\u00e2\u0080\u0094no one does. But our decisions will always reflect our painstaking assessment of what is best for our economy in the medium and longer term\u00e2\u0080\u0094and nothing else.\nTransparency and accountability are fundamental for any government agency in a democracy but are especially important for one granted policy independence. The Fed has a special obligation to explain ourselves clearly\u00e2\u0080\u0094to describe what we are doing and why we are doing it. We are always striving to improve on this communication, and it is a job that is never complete. But we have come a long way. Before 1994, the FOMC did not even announce our monetary policy decisions. Today we announce those decisions and explain the thinking behind them in our post meeting statement and press conference. We publish detailed minutes of our deliberations and a quarterly summary of the economic and policy projections of each FOMC participant. We publish a monetary policy report twice a year, and the Chair appears before Congress to present that report and answer any and all questions that are on the minds of our oversight committee members. In 2020, we completed a yearlong public review of our monetary policy framework, and late this year, we will begin another such review.\n2\nMy colleagues and I explain our views on the economic outlook and monetary policy in speeches like this one, and in visits to communities across the country, as part of extensive outreach in which we seek input from individuals and groups throughout society. Transparency is an affirmative and proactive commitment to the public.\nTo maintain the public's trust, we also need to avoid \"mission creep.\" Our nation faces many challenges, some of which directly or indirectly involve the economy. Fed policymakers are often pressed to take a position on issues that are arguably relevant to the economy but are not within our mandate, such as particular tax and spending policies, immigration policy, and trade policy. Climate change is another current example. Policies to address climate change are the business of elected officials and those agencies that they have charged with this responsibility. The Fed has received no such charge. We do, however, have a narrow role that relates to our responsibilities as a bank supervisor. The public will expect that the institutions we regulate and supervise will understand and be able to manage the material risks that they face, which, over time, are likely to include climate-related financial risks. We will remain alert to the risk that there will be pressure to expand that role over time. We are not, nor do we seek to be, climate policymakers.\nIn short, doing our job well requires that we respect the limits of our mandate.\nThank you. I look forward to our discussion.\n1.

Bowman\nAt The Roundtable on the Lender of Last Resort: The 2023 Banking Crisis and COVID, sponsored by the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nToday's roundtable comes at an opportune time, as we recently passed the one-year anniversary of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank.\n1\nThe long shadow of these bank failures, and the subsequent failure of First Republic, have prompted a great deal of discussion about the bank regulatory framework, including capital regulation, the approach to supervision, and the role of tailoring, among other topics. It is my hope that our discussion today reviews and considers the appropriate role of the Federal Reserve in providing liquidity to the U.S. banking system and, of course, its role as the \"lender of last resort\" through the discount window and authority under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.\nI look forward to today's panels and a deeper examination of important policy questions, including the lessons that should be learned from the banking system stress experienced last spring, the broader stress in financial markets during the COVID-19 crisis, potential approaches to operationally enhance and optimize tools like the discount window to more effectively meet industry liquidity needs, and the importance of effective resolution mechanisms in the banking system.\nBefore the panels get into a \"deep dive\" on these policy issues, I would like to briefly touch on three main themes: (1) the broader framework in which the Federal Reserve supports liquidity in the banking system, particularly how this function complements other regulatory requirements and sources of liquidity; (2) how this function can be optimized to work within the evolving liquidity framework; and (3) the challenges we face in making the Federal Reserve's liquidity tools, particularly the discount window, effective.\nThe Federal Reserve's Role in Banking System Liquidity\nThe complexity of the U.S. financial system makes it difficult to predict where the next stress (or in the worst case, the next crisis) will arise. While today's event will focus on recent episodes that required the Federal Reserve to employ its liquidity tools\u00e2\u0080\u0094the COVID crisis and the early 2023 banking stress\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is helpful to consider how the Federal Reserve's authority has evolved in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\nLet's review the historical context, which could be helpful for framing the discussion. In 1913, Congress established the Federal Reserve at least in part to help address the pattern of cyclical financial panics and the ensuing economic turmoil that followed by allowing the Fed to create a more elastic money supply to meet demand for liquidity during times of stress. This authority included tools like open market operations, later used as a tool for monetary policy.\n2\nSince its establishment, the Federal Reserve was granted the authority to engage in discount window lending.\n3\nIn addition, during the Great Depression, the Fed was given a broader set of tools to engage in emergency lending under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.\n4\nMore recently, in 2003, the Federal Reserve restructured its previous discount window lending programs and established the Primary Credit Facility (PCF) and Secondary Credit Facility.\n5\nPrimary credit enabled financially strong banks to obtain secured loans from the discount window at a penalty rate. The secondary credit provided discount window loans at a higher rate, and with higher collateral haircuts and other more stringent terms than apply for primary credit, to solvent institutions that did not qualify to borrow from the PCF.\n6\nThis evolution of the discount window function more closely aligned operations with a theory, often attributed to Walter Bagehot, that central banks should lend freely to solvent institutions against good collateral, at a penalty rate of interest.\n7\nThe Fed used its lending tools extensively during the 2008 financial crisis. Relying heavily on discount window lending authority and emergency lending facilities under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the Fed provided emergency liquidity to support individual firms that were under severe stress, and to facilitate the flow of credit more broadly. Of course, the financial crisis left a lasting imprint on many Americans who suffered significant economic harm, many of whom have not yet fully recovered. It also prompted Congress to review and amend the Fed's authorities through the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).\nThe banking system today is stronger and more resilient than it was before the 2008 financial crisis with significantly more capital and substantially more liquidity. U.S. banks are also subject to a host of supervisory tools that did not exist prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, like new stress testing requirements.\n8\nMany of the regulatory changes implemented at that time were designed to reduce the probability of large bank failures, but the statute also mandated other changes designed to improve the likelihood that failing large banks could be resolved without broad systemic disruptions.\n9\nOf course, these changes were additive to existing authorities that are meant to promote banking system resilience, particularly the other core element of the federal safety net, deposit insurance.\n10\nCongress also made significant changes to the Fed's emergency lending authority. For example, section 13(3) facilities must now be broad-based, rather than designed only for individual firms, and must be approved by the U.S. Treasury Secretary. In addition, loans can only be made to solvent institutions, and there are new collateral and disclosure requirements.\n11\nFurther, while the Dodd-Frank Act preserved the Fed's ability to make discount window loans to eligible borrowers, including depository institutions and U.S. branches of foreign banks, it made some modifications. Notably, one change that I will return to later is the new requirement that discount window lending is no longer confidential. These loans, including the names of borrowing institutions, are now required to be disclosed with a two-year lag.\n12\nChanges made by the new law and other subsequent changes have attempted to strike a balance between making firms more resilient to stress and adding additional parameters to the Fed's liquidity tools. The complementary tools we have\u00e2\u0080\u0094the prudential bank regulatory framework, tools to promote banking system liquidity and stability, discount window lending and \"lender of last resort\" authority, and resolution tools\u00e2\u0080\u0094all contribute to the safety and soundness of individual banks, and more broadly, to financial stability.\nBroadly defined, the challenge we face is that banking crises and banking stress can arise from unpredictable events. They can be the product of external events (like a global pandemic) or can arise from cascading failures of bank management and regulators to identify and effectively address and mitigate the buildup of risk. This risk can occur at a single institution, like we saw in the lead-up to the failure of SVB, or more broadly throughout the financial system, as we saw during the last financial crisis. When we consider banking system stress and potential crises in the broader context, our primary goal should always be prevention, particularly so that we can avoid contagion risks that lead to financial instability and more significant government intervention. We should be reluctant to intervene in private markets, including using emergency government lending facilities to support private enterprises.\nThe federal safety net that covers the banking system\u00e2\u0080\u0094including discount window lending and deposit insurance\u00e2\u0080\u0094is meant to make the U.S. banking system and broader economy more resilient. Where market disruptions affect liquidity, it is important that these tools\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly discount window lending\u00e2\u0080\u0094function effectively. So, we must ask whether there are steps we can take to optimize the functioning of these tools and identify some of the key challenges we face in making these tools effective, including preserving industry standard access to liquidity outside of the Fed's tools for day-to-day liquidity management, like advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks.\nOptimizing the Lender of Last Resort Function\nWhen we think about the Fed's lender of last resort function, we must think about the broader framework that supports bank liquidity, including liquidity regulation, bank supervision, deposit insurance, and day-to-day liquidity resources. While my discussion today focuses primarily on discount window lending, I will also briefly address design issues that we experienced with the recently expired Bank Term Funding Program.\nI think we can all agree that the discount window remains a critical tool, but it does not operate in isolation. It operates to support bank liquidity, but it is an additional resource in the federal safety net that allows eligible institutions to weather disruptions in liquidity markets and access other resources.\nFirst, there are questions about the utility of the discount window in light of its scope and the evolution of the banking system. There are a limited set of entities that have access to discount window loans, including depository institutions and, in unusual or exigent circumstances, designated financial market utilities.\n13\nAs activities continue to migrate out of the regulated banking system, what are the implications of more activity occurring outside the banking system as it relates to the effectiveness of the discount window as a tool?\nSecond, are there ways in which the Fed can enhance the technology, the operational readiness, and the services underpinning discount window loans to make sure that they are available when needed? Here, the events in the lead-up to the failure of SVB are illuminating\u00e2\u0080\u0094SVB experienced difficulty in accessing the discount window before its failure. We must understand and evaluate these difficulties and determine whether there are improvements the Federal Reserve System can make to ensure the discount window is an effective tool to provide liquidity support. Are there operational issues that can be improved, whether by improving the technology or extending business hours for the discount window and other Reserve Bank payment services like FedWire\n\u00ae\nand ACH (automated clearinghouse), particularly during times of stress? The Federal Reserve System must also take a close look at our operational readiness and capacity. Banking stress can manifest quickly and outside of regular business hours in different time zones, and we must make sure that the tools we have are available and prepared with trained and experienced staff ready to deal with the evolving risks of liquidity stress and pressure.\nFinally, are there changes that need to be made to support contingency liquidity on the borrower side? One prominent issue that has come to light recently is whether there should be some form of pre-positioning requirement\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether banking institutions should be\nrequired\nto hold collateral at the discount window, in anticipation of the need for accessing discount window loans in the future.\n14\nArguably, requiring pre-positioning at the discount window may serve a variety of purposes. One use case is ensuring the system is efficient enough to allow borrowers to\naccess\ndiscount window loans in a timely manner, including by getting collateral to the discount window to support loans. We have much work to do on this front. To fulfill its function, the discount window must be able to provide liquidity quickly. The failure of SVB demonstrated how rapidly a run can occur and revealed that the discount window must be able to operate in a world in which new technologies, rapid communications, and the growth of real-time payments may exacerbate the speed of a bank run. Identifying and mitigating the technology and operational issues that affect the discount window should go a long way to addressing this concern. Understanding that these problems exist and requiring pre-positioning of collateral at the discount window may not fully address any technological and operational shortcomings of the discount window.\nBut as a secondary matter, the notion of required collateral pre-positioning has also been proposed as a complementary liquidity requirement for banks, in part to ensure greater liquidity certainty to balance perceived \"runnable\" funding sources, as with SVB's significant proportion of uninsured deposits. While this could be an effective approach, we do not fully understand the consequences of a new pre-positioning requirement or whether, given the unique nature of SVB's business model and lax supervision, other institutions would have similarly runnable uninsured deposits or if this was an idiosyncratic event.\nFurther, would required pre-positioning of collateral impede a bank's ability to manage its day-to-day liquidity needs (including from private sources at lower cost)? Would pre-positioning collateral increase operational risk, or otherwise change bank activities? Would there be any unintended consequences from requiring banks to encumber more assets on their balance sheets? More fundamentally\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a change of this magnitude, requiring a new daily management of discount window lending capacity, necessary and appropriate for all institutions, or are there particular bank characteristics that may warrant this additional layer of liquidity support? These are all important but as yet unanswered questions that need to be explored and understood before imposing such a radical shift.\nCurrently, banks are not mandated to use the discount window to access liquidity. In fact, one of the core functions of bank management is to make the day-to-day decisions about how the institution will manage liquidity and other responsibilities. While it may be appropriate for supervisors to encourage banks to test contingency funding plans and to evaluate whether those plans are adequate in the context of examination, we must be cautious to not cross the line from supervisor to member of the management team and to avoid interfering with the decisionmaking of bank management by mandating across-the-board changes in response to the failure of a single unique institution.\nWe need to ask whether having one standardized set of rules for institutions with different activities, risk profiles, and funding structures is the most efficient and effective way to support bank liquidity, particularly as we think about not only stressed conditions and liquidity disruptions in the market, but also day-to-day man",

Bowman\nAt A Workshop on the Future of Banking, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri\nShare\nGood morning. Before I provide some context for today's discussions, I would like to thank all of our participants who are here with us today in Kansas City at the Reserve Bank, and those participating remotely. Most importantly, I'd like to thank our host, President Schmid, and his excellent research staff, all of whom helped to organize today's event. I especially appreciate the opportunity to highlight a few specific areas that concern me about the currently regulatory trajectory and their effects on the future of banking.\n1\nToday's workshop addresses timely and important questions, including the forces that will shape the future of the banking system, entry into the banking system, bank mergers and acquisitions, and the state of competition including both the direct and indirect competition banks experience and how regulators measure and assess competition\u00e2\u0080\u0094or at least how we broadly measure it today.\nThe failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank just over a year ago, and the stress to the banking system that ensued, caused many institutions to retrench and prompted regulators to renew their focus on bank regulatory and supervisory policy and approach. Banks responded by enhancing their focus on fundamental risks like interest rate and liquidity risk, adopting a more conservative posture in both risk management and lending. This self-reflection by both industry and regulators continues today. In fact, the long shadow of the bank failures continues to be a driving force for regulatory and supervisory reforms, even for reform proposals that have little relationship to the events surrounding the bank failures and ensuing banking system stress.\nAs I have noted in the past, the regulatory reform agenda, and the less visible but no less important changes to the supervisory process, touch on a wide range of topics that directly and indirectly affect banks of all sizes.\n2\nThe sheer volume of changes presents challenges to regulated institutions. Outside of the largest banks, how does bank management review and provide meaningful comment on voluminous regulatory changes? When those changes are finalized, how does a bank's management reallocate resources to ensure a capability to comply with revised regulations? Are banks, especially small banks, able to locate and retain qualified staff to understand and implement these increasingly complex and burdensome rules? How does a bank's management and compliance officer adjust to supervisory standards and expectations that may be significantly different from exam to exam or regulator to regulator?\nThe 2023 bank failures and circumstances leading up to those failures continue to warrant review, self-reflection, and appropriately targeted changes to identified issues or failures in regulation and supervision. But we should ask whether the volume of reforms that have been proposed, recently finalized, or that are in the pipeline, reflect appropriate prioritization. Or instead, do they suggest that we have lost our focus on furthering the primary goal of prudential bank regulation and supervision\u00e2\u0080\u0094promoting a safe and sound banking system and fostering a thriving banking industry that effectively supports local and regional economies. I am concerned that the broad-based and insufficiently focused reform agenda has become a growing source of risk to the banking system, particularly due to the rushed nature of these reform efforts and the lack of research and understanding of the intended and unintended consequences of these proposals.\n3\nThis reform agenda, for both regulation and supervision, is the backdrop for today's panel discussions.\nRegulatory Approvals in the Banking System\nI have previously spoken about the regulatory dynamics shaping the future of the banking system, from bank capital requirements to liquidity reform, significant revisions to the Community Reinvestment Act, a regulatory attack on banks charging fees for services (including debit card interchange fees), the trend of dialing supervision up to \"11\" for banks of all sizes, increased competition from non-banks, the continued migration of certain activities from regulated banks to non-banks outside of the banking system, and the ongoing erosion of tailoring.\n4\nThese issues continue to shape the contours of the banking system\u00e2\u0080\u0094including bank size, the activities in which they engage, and where activities occur within the broader financial system. The policy decisions embedded in these regulatory reforms, even if only in the form of a proposal, have already begun shaping the U.S. banking system.\nRevisions to the regulatory and supervisory framework reflect policy decisions about not only the risk tolerance of regulators, but also the role of banks in the banking system and the broader U.S. economy. These policy decisions create incentives and impacts that we must acknowledge and understand. When policymakers flatten and standardize regulations and supervisory expectations, we create strong incentives for banks to achieve greater economies of scale through merger and make it harder for new banks to successfully compete with existing banks.\nWhen we \"raise the bar\" for banks to engage in certain activities in a way that is disproportionate to the risk of those activities, we create incentives for those activities to migrate to non-banks outside of the regulatory perimeter. We must understand whether the policy decisions embedded in the regulatory and supervisory framework are effective and complementary. If they are not, we must acknowledge the consequences of knowingly implementing conflicting policy choices.\nDe Novo Bank Formation\nI continue to be concerned about the decline in the number of banks in the U.S. As I have noted in the past, there are several indications that there is an unmet demand for new bank creation indicated by the ongoing preference for \"charter strip\" acquisitions, the ongoing shift of activities out of the banking system, and the rising demand for banking-as-a-service partnerships.\n5\nFor the past decade, de novo bank formation has been largely stagnant, even as the banking industry has rapidly evolved over the same time period. Many factors influence the pursuit of de novo bank charters, including the interest rate environment, business opportunities, the intense competition for qualified bank management and staff, and potentially less onerous alternatives for financial services providers to operate outside of the regulated banking system.\nThe decision to form a de novo bank is also informed by normal business considerations including identifying investors, establishing a viable business plan, and ensuring the ability to navigate the \"start-up\" phase of a new bank and manage upfront operational costs, all while being subjected to intense supervisory oversight over the first several years of de novo bank operation. Yet, perhaps the most important factor that influences de novo bank formation is the regulatory and supervisory framework, which includes the application process and receipt of regulatory approval.\nThe application process can be a significant obstacle to de novo bank formation. Applications often experience significant delays between the initial charter application filing with the chartering authority and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) application for deposit insurance. The timeframe for receiving all of the required regulatory approvals to open for business often takes well in excess of a year. Of course, this uncertainty must be endured after initial capital has been raised, shareholders identified, and a management team ready to begin work. As one can imagine, these delays can present unique challenges for de novo founders including incurring more start-up expenses than anticipated, having difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified management to obtain approval, and experiencing challenges raising additional start-up capital investment.\nSome of the uncertainty surrounding the de novo process flows from supervisory perceptions of this proposed business model. For example, a de novo business plan that focuses on providing banking-as-a-service outside of a defined geographic footprint presents different risks than a business model that focuses on retail banking in an underserved market. It stands to reason that the regulatory expectations for each business model, including capital levels, risk management, and compliance, will vary. Even controlling for the variability in business model, the standards and expectations for a de novo application that will be viewed and treated favorably are opaque and may shift significantly over time, even between and among the regulators.\nThe absence of de novo bank formation over the long run will create a void in the banking system, a void that may contribute to a decline in the availability of reliable and fairly priced credit, the absence of financial services in underserved markets, and the continued shift of banking activities beyond the regulatory perimeter.\nBank Mergers and Acquisitions\nA more immediate concerning influence is the dramatically evolving approach to bank mergers and acquisitions (M&A) by some prudential regulators. It is helpful to consider bank M&A broadly, to include not only bank-to-bank mergers subject to approval under the Bank Merger Act, but also the broader set of business combinations contemplated under sections 3 and 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act, and under section 10 of the Home Owners' Loan Act.\n6\nThese M&A transactions allow banks to thrive in our dynamic banking system, and help to promote the long-term health and viability of banks. M&A also ensures that some institutions have a meaningful path to transitioning bank ownership. In the absence of a viable M&A framework, we increase the potential for additional risks including limited opportunities for succession planning, especially in smaller or rural communities and zombie banks that continue to exist but have no competitive viability or exit strategy.\nM&A reform is currently a popular topic on the banking agency regulatory agenda with the process and standards regulators employ to review and approve transactions under intense scrutiny. Recently some of the federal banking regulators have proposed or described new M&A policy approaches, with the Department of Justice currently reviewing how it enforces section 7 of the Clayton Act.\n7\nAs regulators revisit the evaluation standards for bank M&A transactions under the statutory framework, we should consider whether the regulatory review process is fair, transparent, and consistent with applicable statutes. This should begin with an important threshold question\u00e2\u0080\u0094what are the identified shortcomings with the current process or standards, and are the proposed reforms targeted and effective to address these shortcomings?\nOne concern that has been raised about the M&A regulatory approval process seems largely based on the misconception that a lack of application\ndenials\nimplies that standards are simply not rigorous enough, that the regulatory approval process has become a rubber stamp. This view ignores the reality of the filing process. These transactions require significant upfront and ongoing investment and commitment of resources. At the outset, this includes finding an appropriate acquisition target, conducting due diligence, and negotiating the terms of the transaction. Once a target is identified, the banks must prepare appropriate regulatory filings, engage with regulators during the application process, and prepare for post-approval business processes including scheduling necessary and costly systems conversions and customer transition.\nThis is an expensive and reputationally risky process that bankers take extremely seriously. They do not make the decision to file an application lightly. Even for those institutions that decide to proceed with an application, success is not guaranteed, even in the absence of a regulatory denial. The Federal Reserve's most recent report on banking applications activity identifies a significant portion of bank M&A transactions in which applications have been withdrawn.\n8\nIn its recent proposal, one agency suggested that if an applicant withdraws a filing, that agency's board may release a statement regarding the concerns with the application in the interest of creating transparency for future applicants.\n9\nI have observed that applicants may withdraw a filing for a number of reasons, including prolonged uncertainty due to regulatory delays, expiration of contractual deadlines, and issues that are uncovered only during the processing of the application (for example, the issuance of updated supervisory ratings from recently completed examinations). As a general matter, this approach could evolve to become the expectation for\nall\nwithdrawn applications, and, if so, could put regulators in the untenable position of needing to disclose confidential supervisory information or nonpublic business information about applicants even in the case of a withdrawn application.\nJust as in the de novo bank formation process, one of the key risks to an effective M&A process is a lack of timely regulatory action. The consequences of delays can significantly harm both the acquiring institution and the target, causing greater operational risk (including the risk of a failed merger), increased expenses, reputational risk, and staff attrition in the face of prolonged uncertainty.\nReducing the efficiency of bank M&A can be a deterrent to healthy bank transactions\u00e2\u0080\u0094it can reduce the effectiveness of M&A activity that preserves the presence of community banks in underserved areas, prevent institutions from pursuing prudent growth strategies, and actually undermine competition by preventing firms from growing to a larger scale, effectively creating a \"protected class\" of larger institutions.\nGiven all of these considerations, it seems reasonable to assume that the uncertainty of the M&A process itself may act as a deterrent to de novo bank formation, as potential bank founders stay on the sidelines knowing that future exit strategies\u00e2\u0080\u0094like the strategic acquisition of a de novo bank by a larger peer\u00e2\u0080\u0094may face long odds of success. We must not foreclose bank merger activities that are permitted by law and that are necessary to maintain a healthy banking system.\nInstead, we should focus on ensuring that we can improve the speed and timeliness of regulatory decisionmaking, applying review standards that are reasonable and consistent with the sta",

Cook\nAt the Samuel DuBois Cook Center Career Achievement Awards Ceremony, the University Club, Washington, D.C.\nShare\nThank you, Dr. Darity, for your kind introduction. I am profoundly moved to be surrounded by family and friends, and it gives me another opportunity to tell all of you that I would not be where I am today without your support. I include in that circle my fellow award recipients today, Drs. Cecilia Rouse and Peter Blair Henry.\nI am beyond humbled and honored to receive this career achievement award from The Samuel DuBois Cook Center on Social Equity at Duke University, and I am inspired by what it represents. Of course, to me, Samuel DuBois Cook was simply \"Uncle Sam.\" My Uncle Sam was a Korean War veteran, a political theorist, an activist, and the first African American tenured professor at Duke and any major southern university. He then went on to become president of Dillard University . . . the list goes on and on. Now that was a lifetime of achievement.\nAt Morehouse College, Uncle Sam was a classmate of a young man named Martin Luther King, Jr. Before that, they picked tobacco together during the summer to earn the money they needed for their studies. Uncle Sam led the campus chapter of the NAACP at Morehouse and went on to become student body president (twice) and valedictorian. Along with my mother Mary Murray Cook, his brother and my dad Rev. Payton Brailsford Cook, my cousin and civil rights leader Floyd McKissick, Sr., and a host of other relatives, he instilled in me the deep belief of the Civil Rights Movement that with faith, preparation, and great effort, things could and would be better. When I was beaten and suffered verbal assaults while desegregating my schools in Georgia, I drew strength from the example set by my uncle, my aunts, my parents, and by Dr. King and their conviction that there is great hope and promise in the world. It was\u00e2\u0080\u0094and remains\u00e2\u0080\u0094the duty of everyone in and who embraced and was inspired by the Civil Rights Movement to make good on that hope and promise and to build a better future.\nI mentioned great effort. That was always paramount for my Uncle Sam.\nThe New York Times\nquoted his advice: \"Have a vision\u00e2\u0080\u0094a dream of success\u00e2\u0080\u0094and work like hell.\"\nUncle Sam believed people need guides, role models, and taskmasters to take advantage of the greater opportunities he helped to make possible. We call those guides, role models, and taskmasters \"mentors\" for short.\nI found many mentors along my academic journey, and I would like to give special thanks to those I met through the Diversity Initiative for Tenure in Economics, which Sandy Darity started at Duke in 2008. The Initiative is a research mentoring workshop that pairs junior faculty with mentors who can help them navigate the path to tenure. It has seen 53 Initiative fellows being promoted and tenured at institutions of higher learning.\nI am grateful to all the mentors who took my ideas seriously, including Art Goldsmith who was a DITE mentor, helped me sharpen the hypotheses that emerged from them, and pressed me to think hard about the best data and methods to test these hypotheses. Graduate and undergraduate students from many backgrounds ask me how to find mentors that share their background. I tell them they will need more than one mentor and to seek out mentors who have different backgrounds and expertise such that they will be exposed to a wide range of views and experiences. For just one paper on violence and patents, I had several mentors, among them George Akerlof, Ken Arrow, Sandy Darity, Barry Eichengreen, Milton Friedman, Alan Krueger, Paul Romer, and Jeff Wooldridge. Most importantly, make sure your mentors challenge you and hold you accountable. And when the time comes, it is incumbent on you\u00e2\u0080\u0094on all of us, really\u00e2\u0080\u0094to become a mentor. That is what Uncle Sam did. That is one reason I was grateful to lead the American Economic Association's Summer Program, to receive the AEA Mentoring Program's Impactful Mentor award for working with graduate students, and to participate in and support other initiatives to train young economists. Mentors help convert hope and promise into action, enabling those who come after us to build a better future. As I learned from Uncle Sam, there is no higher calling.\nIn closing, let me express my hope that accepting this career achievement award does not mean I am officially retired. But more seriously, I am very grateful to be recognized and in the company of colleagues who have stood by me and fought with me to improve our field. I accept this award in the spirit of challenge it represents. I am forever mindful of Samuel DuBois Cook's belief that there is much work ahead of us as we seek to build a world that is more just and offers more opportunity for all. Although this may be called a career achievement award, I accept it with the conviction that I am just getting started.\nLast Update:\r\n                \r\n                            April 01, 2024",

Waller\nAt the Economic Club of New York, New York, New York\nShare\nThank you, Barbara, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n1\nMy subject, as it often is, is the outlook for the U.S. economy, and how that affects the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) continuing effort to reduce inflation to a sustained level of 2 percent while maintaining a healthy labor market.\nWe made a lot of headway toward our inflation goal in 2023, and the labor market moved substantially into better balance, all while holding the unemployment rate below 4 percent for nearly two years. But the data we have received so far this year has made me uncertain about the speed of continued progress. Back in February, I noted that data on fourth quarter gross domestic product (GDP) as well as January data on job growth and inflation came in hotter than expected. I concluded then that we needed time to verify that the progress on inflation we saw in the second half of 2023 would continue, which meant there was no rush to begin cutting interest rates to normalize the stance of monetary policy.\nOver the past month, additional economic data has reinforced this view. February job gains moved back up to 275,000, making the three-month average a strong 265,000, and various inflation measures have continued to come in hot. Core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation jumped to 0.4 percent on a monthly basis in January, after averaging around 0.1 percent in October through December last year. And with February consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index inflation data in hand, some forecasts are predicting core PCE inflation may be revised up for January and is expected to come in at 0.3 percent for February, which we will learn about on Friday. Adding this new data to what we saw earlier in the year reinforces my view that there is no rush to cut the policy rate. Indeed, it tells me that it is prudent to hold this rate at its current restrictive stance perhaps for longer than previously thought to help keep inflation on a sustainable trajectory toward 2 percent.\nI continue to believe that further progress will make it appropriate for the FOMC to begin reducing the target range for the federal funds rate this year. But until that progress materializes, I am not ready to take that step. Fortunately, the strength of the U.S. economy and resilience of the labor market mean the risk of waiting a little longer to ease policy is small and significantly lower than acting too soon and possibly squandering our progress on inflation.\nTurning to the performance of the U.S. economy, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model, based on all current data, predicts first quarter growth in real GDP of 2.1 percent at an annual rate. Similarly, the consensus from the Blue Chip survey of private sector forecasters is 2 percent. This would be a significant slowdown from the average of around 4 percent in the second half of 2024 but still quite solid growth.\nConsumer spending, the largest component of GDP, seems to be moderating this quarter. Retail sales fell significantly in January and then retraced about half of that decline in February. Smoothing out these swings, they clearly indicate a moderation in goods spending from the second half of last year. However, services spending, excluding energy, grew moderately in January, which offset to some extent the decline in goods spending. I will be watching on Friday morning to see what the February data on personal income and spending show.\nOn the business side, surveys of purchasing managers in February continued to report results we have been hearing for over a year. For manufacturers, the Institute for Supply Management indicated a slight contraction in activity, with new orders and production moving down a bit. This contrasts with nonmanufacturing businesses that continued to see an expansion in activity, with measures of new orders and business activity on the higher end of their readings over the past year.\nNow let me turn to the labor market. The data is sending a mixed message on how supply and demand are evolving. As I noted earlier, payroll data estimate that employers added 275,000 jobs in February. This robust gain is not only above the 265,000 average level of job creation since November, but also above the 251,000 monthly average for all of 2023. Recent gains have been broad based across most sectors, rather than concentrated in a few sectors, which may be a sign that demand is not moderating as much as is needed to support continued progress on inflation. Conversely, the household survey estimated that the unemployment rate rose to 3.9 percent in February. But that increase was driven mostly by an outsized rise in the number of 16- to 24-year-olds counted as unemployed. Youth employment tends to be volatile, so this rate may drop back in the next few months and, if so, pull the overall unemployment rate back down as well.\nAnother sign of loosening in the labor market is that the number of people quitting their jobs has fallen below the levels just before the pandemic. I believe most workers quit their jobs for better pay or other benefits. So less turnover means firms do not need to enhance their compensation packages to attract workers.\nIn reviewing wage pressures, the most recent data suggest nominal wage growth has continued to ease. But most of these measures are still above their pre-pandemic levels. And, considering overall compensation\u00e2\u0080\u0094wages and benefits \u00e2\u0080\u0094here, too, growth has slowed but remains a bit elevated.\nLooking across various indicators of labor demand, there hasn't been much change in recent months. Job openings drifted down last year but then flattened out recently at a still elevated level, while the pace of hiring is close to its pre-pandemic level. With strong labor supply and little apparent change in demand in recent months, the ratio of vacancies to people looking for work has been roughly flat after declining significantly in 2023. At 1.4 jobs for each person looking, that ratio is down from 2022's peak of around 2 and indicates that the labor market has loosened up. But the vacancies-to-unemployed rate is still higher than the 1.2 that prevailed before the pandemic and has held steady around 1.4 for several months, which suggests that the labor market remains tight.\nLet me turn to a topic related to the labor market that has important implications for the longer-term course of U.S. economy: productivity. When productivity across the economy grows quickly, it means that output and income can also grow quickly without putting upward pressure on inflation, so it supports rising living standards. And lately, productivity has been growing fast. Over the final three quarters of 2023, it grew at a pace a bit under 4 percent, much faster than the average since the 1970s. Some have argued that this must be why we had such strong economic growth in 2023, even while inflation was slowing. Perhaps, they say, we are at the start of another era of fast and sustained productivity growth, such as the United States experienced from 1998 through 2004.\nBelieve me, I hope this is true, because it would be the basis for broadly shared prosperity that raises living standards, but I am skeptical that it will last. The first thing to note is that productivity growth is notoriously volatile. Though productivity grew fast for the final nine months of last year, it actually fell in the first quarter of 2023 and rather substantially for all of 2022. One may view this fast growth as making up for the earlier declines. In fact, smoothing across the past two years, productivity growth averages a bit above 1.25 percent annually. Also keep in mind that periods of fast growth that last more than a few years are unusual, and it is also difficult to be sure about the causes.\nWhen thinking about productivity, one has to distinguish between factors that raise productivity in the short run but ultimately are one-off increases in the\nlevel\nof productivity, as opposed to those that increase the long-run\ngrowth\nrate\nof productivity so that the level is constantly increasing. So let me posit several factors that have been suggested for explaining the recent increase in productivity and try to place them in the one-off or long-run buckets.\nMany people point to recent large investment projects in the United States, such as those associated with the Inflation Reduction Act or artificial intelligence, as boosting productivity. But these investments will take place over many years and may not have done much yet to add to the nation's productive capacity. While it is possible they could increase longer-run productivity growth, it remains to be seen if they will. Thus, they are unlikely to explain the recent rise in productivity growth.\nThe recent surge in business start-ups after a sustained lull has also been mentioned as a factor. Like the investment projects, it may be causing a boost to productivity, but it is likely to occur over a number of years. And, unless the current boom in new business formation continues into the future, once again this factor will at best raise the level of productivity over the short term and not the long-run growth rate.\nAnother factor that is often pointed to is the resolution of supply chain problems. But once the supply chain issues are resolved, this boost to productivity growth will end, so this clearly is a short-run factor that will simply raise the level but not the long-run growth rate of productivity.\nAnother potential cause of recent productivity growth is that the pandemic changed how we work and use technology. While I certainly can see how this could affect the level of productivity and short-run growth, once we have made those changes, they're done, so I don't see this as a driver of sustained productivity growth. I have also heard the argument that when labor turnover was very high during the pandemic, new hires were being trained, and by the time they were ready to start contributing to production, they would leave for a new job and start a new training process. Now that the pace of turnover is back down to normal levels, firms are reaping the benefits of keeping newly trained workers who then move up the learning curve at the firm. Again, while I see this raising the level of productivity in the short run, it may simply be returning productivity to previous levels.\nI will be watching how productivity evolves in the near term. I will keep my fingers crossed for more good news, but I am not convinced that the recent boom in productivity growth will continue. Therefore, I will keep that in mind as I form my judgments about the economic outlook and appropriate setting of monetary policy.\nNow let's talk about inflation. We made a lot of headway in reducing inflation in the past year or so, although the readings in the past two months have been disappointing. Both total CPI inflation and core inflation that excludes energy and food rounded to a 0.4 percent increase for the month of February, which is obviously not progress toward our inflation goal. While housing services prices, which rose in January, moderated a bit, core goods prices, which had been falling recently, rose due to elevated import price increases. In trying to judge what the underlying trend is for inflation, I tend to look at annualized core measures over 3 or 6 months. For most of a year, I watched these numbers come down more quickly than 12-month readings, telling me that we were making substantial progress. But, more recently, the 3-month core CPI, which was running at a 3.3 percent rate in December, rose to 4.2 percent in February. Six-month core CPI, which was also 3.3 percent in December, was up to 3.9 percent last month. These shorter-term inflation measures are now telling me that progress has slowed and may have stalled. But we will need more data to know that.\nThe FOMC uses personal consumption expenditure inflation data to measure progress toward our 2 percent goal, and we won't get those results for February until Friday. But, as I noted at the start, based on the consumer and producer prices that we do have, estimates suggest that core PCE inflation is likely to be elevated. Though the February reading is estimated to step down from January's, this recent pace would not represent significant progress toward 2 percent.\nLet me pause here and make an important point about how I think about and want to talk about adverse developments such as this recent inflation data and how as a policymaker I manage risks to the economic outlook.\nIt is appropriate to point out that a month or two of data does not necessarily indicate a trend, and there are good reasons to think that progress on inflation will be uneven but likely to continue down toward 2 percent. At the same time, monetary policy is data driven, and I do want to take it into account when formulating my economic outlook. While I don't want to over-react to two months of data, I do think it is appropriate to react to it.\nThere is ample evidence that the recent data has also been taken on board by both financial markets and forecasters in adjusting their views of the economic outlook. The markets have pulled back the number of expected rate cuts in 2024. FOMC participants have also adjusted their views on policy in response to recent data and it is reflected in the Summary of Economic Projections. Comparing the December 2023 projections to those just released, one sees that the median number of cuts in the federal funds rate for 2024 is still three, but the dots for 2024 have moved up, meaning at least several policymakers removed one or more cuts from their projection. In fact, the number of policymakers expecting more than three cuts in 2024 decreased significantly, while the number expecting two or fewer increased. I interpret this as showing that the Committee is not over-reacting to the recent data but is not discounting it either.\nIn my view, it is appropriate to reduce the overall number of rate cuts or push them further into the future in response to the recent data. This reflects the reality of managing an outlook in real time as data comes in. Subsequent data may well alter this outlook again, but we shall see. Based on what we know now, there is no urgency in taking that step.\nSo where do I see things standing? I see economic output and the labor market showing continued strength, while progress in reducing inflation has slowed. Because of these signs, I see no rush in taking the step of beginning to ease monetary policy. The target range for the federal funds rate has been 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent since last July, and I believe that this restrictive level is helping to reduce imbalances in the economy and co",

Cook\nAt Ec10b Principles of Economics Lecture, Department of Economics, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts\nShare\nThank you, Jason, for your kind introduction. I appreciate the opportunity to return to Harvard and teach the Ec10 class today. When I taught at Harvard, only the most gifted instructors and teaching fellows were allowed to teach and appear before students in this course. It seems today that standards may have slipped, but I am nevertheless honored to be here.\nI will start by saying what I said at the beginning of every course I taught here and in my entire career as an academic economist. \"It is a great time to be an economist!\" Economics provides powerful tools for understanding the forces that affect your lives, especially in times of upheaval and change. This is another reason I am delighted to be part of this course that covers a broad range of economic thinking.\nToday, I will focus my talk on three topics: the Federal Reserve's dual mandate goals for monetary policy, recent indicators of progress toward meeting those goals, and what we call the evolving \"balance of risks,\" which means how the probabilities of missing one of those goals, compared to the other, change over time.\n1\nMy main message is that, following a period of unusually high inflation and rapid monetary-policy tightening, inflation has fallen considerably while the labor market has remained strong. As a result of these welcome developments, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. Nonetheless, fully restoring price stability may take a cautious approach to easing monetary policy over time.\nLet me add some background here. Congress has given the Federal Reserve's monetary policymakers a mandate and the independence with which to pursue it. The Fed's modern statutory mandate, as described in the 1977 amendment to the Federal Reserve Act, is to promote maximum employment and stable prices.\n2\nThese goals are commonly referred to as the dual mandate.\n3\nI will elaborate on the benefits of achieving these objectives, starting with maximum employment.\nBenefits of Maximum Employment\nI gave a speech last fall that described the evolution of the Federal Reserve's employment mandate.\n4\nI discussed how leaders of the civil rights movement, including Coretta Scott King, identified unemployment as a pernicious factor holding back disadvantaged communities and people. Mrs. King wisely noted that \"unemployment lies at the root of all our major social problems.\"\n5\nEconomists also understand that high unemployment has painful consequences for individual workers and their families. These include reduced living standards and a greater incidence of poverty.\nHigh levels of employment are key to a vibrant economy. It means that a vital resource is being used most productively, resulting in a larger and more prosperous economy. Maximum employment promotes business investment, boosting productivity and the economy's long-run growth potential. And the full participation of all segments of society should foster the development and dissemination of more ideas, including more diverse ideas, more invention, and more innovation.\n6\nA strong labor market also tends to increase labor force participation and makes employers more willing to recruit and upgrade the skills of workers. When the Federal Reserve held a series of community outreach events in 2019, called\nFed Listens\n, one of the key messages we heard was that a strong labor market brings in people who might be on the sidelines of the economy but who have skills that can be developed, if given a chance.\nBenefits of Price Stability\nNow let us consider the purpose of the other part of our mandate, price stability, by which I mean low inflation.\n7\nFormer Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan once said, \"Price stability is that state in which expected changes in the general price level do not effectively alter business or household decisions.\"\n8\nHe meant that when households and businesses can reasonably expect inflation to remain low and stable, they are able to make sound decisions regarding saving, borrowing, and investment, thereby contributing to a well-functioning and growing economy. Low and stable inflation reduces uncertainty about future prices and business conditions, promoting a favorable environment for investment in productive capacity and human potential.\nPrice stability means avoiding periods of high inflation, which are a particular burden on those who are disadvantaged and least able to bear it. The costs of inflation were described by many community members in the\nFed Listens\nevents that the Federal Reserve has held in the past couple of years. Price stability also creates the conditions for a sustainably strong labor market. If inflation fluctuates a lot, it may require a more forceful monetary policy response, and the process of reining in inflation can contribute to bouts of higher unemployment. In contrast, price stability provides a background against which employment can rise more steadily, which is why well-anchored inflation expectations are so important.\nPrice Stability: Evolution and International Comparisons\nWhile the Fed has considered price stability a key objective for its entire 110\u00e2\u0080\u0091year history and the 1977 amendment made price stability an official goal in the Federal Reserve Act, a specific numerical objective for inflation is a relatively recent development. The breakthrough came in January 2012, when the monetary policymakers who make up the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) stated that they judge that inflation of 2 percent over the longer run, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), is most consistent with the Federal Reserve's mandate of maximum employment and price stability.\nThere were a few reasons to set an inflation of target of 2 percent, rather than zero.\n9\nNear-zero inflation can slide into sustained deflation, which is often associated with significant job losses, and debt burdens increase when prices are falling.\nA positive inflation target also allows the central bank more room to adjust its nominal policy rate to achieve a real interest rate sufficiently negative to provide stimulus during economic downturns.\nAmong advanced economies (those with a high level of per capita GDP and globally integrated financial markets), all central banks have a mandate of price stability with a numerical objective. Most have 2 percent as either the target or the midpoint of a target range.\nMaximum Employment: Evolution and International Comparisons\nAlthough other advanced-economy central banks do not have a dual mandate like the Fed, most of them explicitly or implicitly consider employment or economic activity in their setting of monetary policy. Statutorily, employment is often a secondary mandate to price stability. Functionally, these other central banks tend to describe the outlook for employment as affecting the speed with which they attempt to return inflation to their target. For instance, if there is a shock that raises inflation above the target at a time when the unemployment rate is also high, such a central bank would tighten policy less than if its only objective was to move inflation back to that target as quickly as possible. This way of operationalizing inflation targeting implies that there is a significant weight on employment in monetary policy decisions.\nIn the case of the United States, the difference is that Congress made the Fed's employment mandate more explicit. Employment was always mentioned as an objective of the Fed, but the 1977 amendment to the Federal Reserve Act made it part of the main U.S. law applying to monetary policy.\nThe Fed has not set a numerical target for its mandate of maximum employment. The unemployment rate is a key variable in evaluating progress toward that goal. Economists have a concept of the natural rate of unemployment, sometimes called u*, defined as the rate of unemployment compatible with a steady inflation rate. But u* cannot be directly measured and is only imprecisely estimated. Moreover, it likely changes over time as the structure of the economy evolves.\nThe aggregate unemployment rate is also not the only consideration in determining whether we are meeting our maximum-employment goal. Labor force participation also matters, as well as other elements of the labor market that I will discuss later.\nMonetary Policy Tradeoffs\nHow should we think about the tradeoff between our two goals? There is no long-run tradeoff that monetary policy can exploit. Monetary policy is generally thought to be able to control inflation over the long run. In contrast, the maximum level of employment depends on structural forces and economic policies beyond the influence of monetary policy.\nIn the short run, the two mandates often suggest the same course of action. This is particularly true in the presence of demand shocks. For instance, a negative demand shock in the economy will tend to raise unemployment and also put downward pressure on inflation. In this case, both mandates suggest a need for monetary stimulus to increase demand in the economy, bring down unemployment, and keep inflation from falling significantly below target.\nHowever, a negative supply shock (like a rise in oil prices) will tend to increase both inflation and unemployment at first, which creates a short-run tradeoff for monetary policy. Stimulus to bring down unemployment could push inflation even higher, but responding aggressively to inflation may have significant employment costs. The FOMC lays out our approach to this potential tradeoff in its annual Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which says the following:\nThe Committee's employment and inflation objectives are generally complementary. However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it takes into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.\n10\nIn 2022 and into 2023, with unemployment near historical lows but inflation at its highest level in four decades, it was clear that this approach to meeting the dual mandate implied forceful tightening of monetary policy. More recently, with inflation having fallen substantially, even as the labor market has remained strong, it is worth considering how economic developments may have shifted policy tradeoffs and associated risks.\nInflation Indicators\nHow do we evaluate whether we are meeting our dual-mandate goals? Starting with inflation, we look at the 12-month change in the PCE price index, which rose to more than 7 percent in mid-2022 (\nslide 1\n).\nAs economies around the world gradually reopened after pandemic-related shutdowns, demand picked up, especially for goods. But supply chains were slower to recover, leading to a global surge in inflation. That surge was followed by a further upswing in inflation after February 2022, when Russia's invasion of Ukraine reduced global supplies of commodities, including oil and natural gas, food, and fertilizers.\nSince then, supply bottlenecks have eased, labor supply has recovered robustly, and aggregate demand has been dampened by higher interest rates and the end of pandemic-era fiscal support. With supply and demand coming into better balance, PCE inflation has retreated, reaching 2.4 percent in January.\nBecause monetary policy affects the real economy, or the part of the economy that involves producing goods and services, with a lag and affects inflation with an even longer lag, monetary policy must be forward-looking. Therefore, we look at measures that may provide better guides to the direction of future inflation. One such measure is core inflation (excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be volatile). Core inflation rose less sharply than overall inflation but has also moved down a bit less, to 2.8 percent in January.\nTo understand how inflation has evolved in recent years, we can look at its components (\nslide 2\n). Food and energy prices helped drive the rise in inflation following the shocks from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Inflation in these two volatile categories has slowed considerably since 2022 as supply constraints have eased, although the level of grocery prices (in particular) remains elevated, which is a burden on many households.\nAmong components of core inflation, core goods prices were most affected by supply bottlenecks and the shift toward more goods consumption during the pandemic. Core goods inflation also has slowed most appreciably over the past two years, returning recently to its pre-pandemic trend of prices falling moderately. One salient example of the turnaround is in the motor vehicle sector. Shortages of computer chips used as components sharply curtailed automobile production, even as consumer demand for autos rose amid reduced usage of public transportation. Those chip shortages drove vehicle prices sharply higher, and their resolution and the subsequent rebound in auto production have driven a decline in vehicle prices over the past year.\nPrices of core services excluding housing did not rise as dramatically as goods, but inflation in those services has also not come down as quickly. That partly reflected strong demand as households resumed their consumption of in-person services like travel and dining. At the same time, because services prices tend to be adjusted less frequently than goods prices, it could also be that some prices are still adjusting to the increase in input costs during the pandemic.\nHousing services prices were boosted by several factors. The surge in working from home increased demand for larger homes and those located in less expensive metro areas or further from city centers. Because these shifts in demand happened much more rapidly than the response in housing supply, rents increased quite notably, especially for single-family detached homes. Initially, new and existing homeowners were able to lock in historically low long-term mortgage rates, which also drove up the demand for housing.\nThe housing-services price index adjusts with a lag to changes in market rents (or the rent charged to a new tenant), because the index measures the rise in rents for all tenants, including those with continuing leases whose rent is unchanged (\nslide 3\n). But eventually, as leases turn over, changes in the rental market are reflected in housing services prices. Although housing-services inflation remains quite high, the current low rate of ",

Bowman\nAt the New Jersey Bankers Association Annual Economic Leadership Forum, Somerset, New Jersey\nShare\nI would like to thank the New Jersey Bankers Association for the invitation to share my thoughts with you today.\n1\nWhile I welcome the opportunity to share my thoughts about monetary policy, the economy, and the path of regulatory reform, I find it even more valuable to hear your views on local banking and economic conditions in the communities you serve, and your perspectives on trends in bank regulation and supervision. These conversations provide valuable insights to inform my work at the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u0080\u0094both for my understanding of the economy and the banking environment.\nBefore discussing bank regulation, I would like to briefly touch on the economy and monetary policy.\nMonetary Policy\nOver the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our most recent meeting in January, we voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.\nWe have seen continued progress on inflation over the past year, with the 12-month readings through January of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation moving down to 2.4 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, both at the lowest rates we have seen since early 2021. Although inflation declined over the second half of 2023, the January inflation data suggest that progress in bringing inflation down further may be slower going forward. Throughout this time, economic activity has remained strong with ongoing strength in consumer spending. We had also seen signs of the labor market coming into better balance, but recent strong jobs reports\u00e2\u0080\u0094including upward revisions to employment growth\u00e2\u0080\u0094show a continued tight labor market. Last year, the average pace of job gains slowed and the labor force participation rate rose through November, with the unemployment rate edging up to 3.7 percent. In recent months, however, job growth has rebounded, and the labor force participation rate declined, retracing some of its earlier gains.\nAt its current setting, our monetary policy stance is restrictive and appears to be appropriately calibrated to reduce inflationary pressures. As I've noted recently, my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook. These include risks from geopolitical developments, including the risk of spillovers from geopolitical conflicts and the extent to which food and energy markets and supply chains remain exposed to these influences. There is also the risk that a loosening in financial conditions and additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate. Finally, there is a risk that continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation. Recent labor market data suggest ongoing elevated wage growth as some businesses continue to report above-average wage increases to compensate for elevated prices and high inflation.\nGiven these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years, as seen in the most recent employment report, make the task of assessing the current state of the economy as well as predicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging, and I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy. Should the incoming data continue to indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower our policy rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. In my view, we are not yet at that point. Reducing our policy rate too soon could result in requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2 percent over the longer run.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for the outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level that will bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.\nNotable Developments in Bank Regulation and Supervision\nAs I look at the bank regulatory agenda, I am struck by the sheer volume of matters that have recently been completed, that have been proposed, and that are in the pipeline. These reforms touch on a wide range of topics that directly or indirectly impact banks of all sizes. This work shows no signs of slowing down. The large number of finalized, proposed, and potential changes suggest insufficient prioritization in furthering the primary goal of prudential bank regulation and supervision\u00e2\u0080\u0094promoting a safe and sound banking system. In fulfilling this statutory objective, we must also focus on efficiency and effectiveness and always consider how regulatory reforms affect the banking market, the economy, and those who use banking services. We should also ensure, in our pursuit of reform, that our efforts result in a bank framework that is appropriately tailored and calibrated.\nI have spoken at length over the past few months about some recent notable developments in bank regulation, touching on capital reform, the Community Reinvestment Act, the cap on debit card interchange fees, and climate-related financial risk guidance.\n2\nToday, I want to recap my views on some of these developments, particularly around bank mergers and acquisitions (M&A), liquidity regulation, and trends in bank supervision.\nBank mergers and acquisitions\nBank mergers and acquisitions continue to be an important part of the banking ecosystem. In this process, timing is key. However, this is another policy area where I expect to see ongoing focus from federal regulators, the Department of Justice, and others. As policymakers engage on this topic, a key consideration should be whether the application process is fair, transparent, and consistent with the applicable statutory requirements.\n3\nAnd yet, policy reforms may make bank M&A transactions more difficult for regulators to approve and slow the application processing timeline.\nAs all bankers know, application processing delays can be quite harmful, resulting in greater operational risk, increased expenses due in part to contract delays, reputational risk, and staff attrition due to the prolonged uncertainty. In the broader context, reducing the efficiency of bank mergers and acquisitions may also act as a deterrent to a healthy evolution of the banking system. Taken together, reducing merger or acquisition activity could have the consequence of prohibiting transactions that may preserve the presence of banks in rural or underserved areas, transactions that may further prudent growth strategies, or transactions that may result in increased competition with larger peers.\nRegulatory reforms in this area should prioritize speed and timeliness. Stakeholders who are concerned about current bank M&A procedures and policies should consider direct engagement with regulators.\n4\nLiquidity\nFollowing the bank failures last spring, significant attention has been paid to the alleged \"lessons learned\" creating a path for regulatory reform efforts. This has generated discussion among both policymakers and the public on how to think about liquidity regulation: Should these requirements be expanded to a broader range of institutions? Should the calibration or operation of liquidity requirements like the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio be modified? Should we consider new liquidity requirements, and if so, what form should they take?\nI have significant concerns about the path ahead as it comes to regulatory reforms involving liquidity requirements. All banks must manage their liquidity but should have flexibility based on a range of factors, including risk, business model, size, complexity, funding needs, vulnerability to deposit runs, and other considerations. Liquidity requirements, if not appropriately designed and calibrated, could trap resources that would otherwise be put to better use, like lending to bank customers. Before moving forward, we need to identify gaps in the current framework and build a foundation for any proposed changes that is based on research, evidence, and data.\nLiquidity regulation also has the potential to impose significant costs and limit the lending capacity and business operations of banks, which we must recognize and take into account before imposing any new requirements.\nWe must think about liquidity broadly, including the sources and uses of liquidity that institutions use today, including the Federal Reserve's discount window and its role as lender of last resort, advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks, and other sources that may be available in the market. In this context, we must be honest about the capability and capacity of these resources, and the challenges and limits of these tools.\nRevisions to the liquidity framework must also be coordinated to ensure that reform efforts are complementary and can support the banking system's liquidity needs. When considering new liquidity requirements, we must think about not only calibration and scope, but also the unintended consequences of any such requirements and whether these measures will be effective during stressed conditions.\nTrends in supervision\nDuring 2023 and into 2024, many banks reported very material shifts in bank examinations and ongoing intensification in supervisory expectations. Many of these examination-related shifts have received little public acknowledgement or attention in large part because the rules designed to protect confidential supervisory information frustrate visibility into structural shifts in the supervisory process. As you all know well, changes in supervisory expectations frequently come without the benefit of guidance, advance notice, or published rulemaking, and in the worst-case scenario these shifts, cloaked by the veil of supervisory opacity, can have significant financial and reputational impacts or can disrupt the management and operations of affected banks.\nThese changes largely occurred after the bank failures in the spring of 2023 and the ensuing banking stress. In part, the changes in supervisory practices may be attributable to flawed post-mortem reviews conducted in the immediate aftermath of these failures. Many of these reviews suffered from serious shortcomings, including compressed timeframes for completion and the significantly limited matters that were within the scope of review. Nevertheless, these reviews were, and continue to be, singularly relied upon as a basis for resetting regulatory and supervisory priorities. These trends in supervision are concerning and add to the already significant burdens placed on regulated institutions from an aggressive regulatory reform agenda. I worry that the mere fact of bank failures and the material banking stress we experienced last year has been interpreted as a \"blank check\" to remake supervision as a blunt instrument, one that ignores the unique characteristics of each firm and the benefits of an approach that prioritizes engagement and communication between banks and examiners.\nOf course, the banking agencies cannot regulate our way to better or more effective supervision; in the aftermath of the banking stress, it is appropriate to look carefully at what is working, and what isn't, in the realm of bank supervision. But in doing so, we must appropriately manage our supervisory programs and teams to ensure that effective and consistent supervision is implemented within each firm, and that it is effective and consistent across our regulated entities. Conducting supervision in a manner that respects due process and provides transparency around supervisory expectations can help us accomplish these goals.\nClosing Thoughts\nThank you again for the opportunity to speak with you today. We are experiencing significant changes in the banking industry, not least of which are those coming from the regulators. It is imperative that you continue engaging on all matters involving regulatory reform. Policymakers cannot fulfill the responsibility of promoting a safe and sound banking system if we ignore efficiency, tailoring, and appropriate calibration of requirements in the reform agenda. These tenets should be central to the reform process. I welcome your insight on what is working, what is not, and the real-world consequences of regulations and regulatory reform efforts. Your input helps us ensure that the bank regulatory framework supports safety and soundness in an efficient and fair way.\nThank you for your continued engagement, and I look forward to our conversation.\n1.

Bowman\nAt the Harvard Law School Faculty Club, Cambridge, Massachusetts\nShare\nThank you for the invitation to join you this evening at Harvard Law School.\n1\nIt is an honor and a pleasure to speak to this distinguished group. To kick off our conversation, I would like to frame the discussion by offering my views on a key element underpinning the U.S. bank regulatory framework: the role of tailoring. While the principle itself is simple\u00e2\u0080\u0094setting regulatory priorities and allocating supervisory resources in a risk-based way\u00e2\u0080\u0094the consequences of tailoring (or not) can reverberate throughout the banking system, the broader U.S. financial system, and the economy. I see a clear nexus between tailoring and fidelity to the law, including a targeted focus within our statutorily mandated prudential responsibilities.\nTailoring as a Grounding Principle\nI have long been a proponent of tailoring and continue to consider it a strong foundational principle upon which to apply bank regulation and supervision. This approach ensures a focus on the most critical risks over time, avoiding the over-allocation of resources or imposition of unnecessary costs on the banking system. When we approach rulemaking with a commitment to tailoring, and to our broader prudential mandates, the public can judge our actions by how well they serve these ends, and they should rightly be concerned when regulatory actions seem to serve other goals. In this sense, tailoring keeps policymakers grounded and facilitates appropriate prioritization. Tailoring also allows us to allocate limited supervisory resources to most effectively support safety and soundness of the banking system and U.S. financial stability.\nIn accordance with the law, the Federal Reserve, both in its monetary policy function and in the execution of its bank regulatory and supervisory responsibilities, is meant to operate independently and apolitically. But banking regulators have a responsibility to act in a way that proves this independence is warranted. We earn the right to operate with this independence when we consistently follow the law and achieve our prudential objectives. One of the most effective ways we accomplish this goal is through the appropriate prioritization of risks in the financial system. Regardless of the approach to bank regulation and supervision, bank regulators should be subject to oversight and accountability, to both Congress and the public.\nThe principles that guide the execution of prudential responsibilities matter, especially when they further efficiency and effectiveness. Congress has embedded the concept of tailoring within the Federal Reserve's regulatory mandates, including the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, commonly referred to as S. 2155.\n2\nThis law revised provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, amending the\nthreshold\nfor tailored application of enhanced prudential standards on certain regulated institutions.\n3\nNotably, S. 2155 did not\nintroduce\ntailoring to these standards; it merely modified tailoring thresholds and mandated the Board implement this approach. To be clear, tailoring is not a pretext for deregulation but rather a principle that allows regulators to pursue required statutory objectives in the most efficient and effective way.\nDoes Tailoring Need a Defender?\nI suppose one could view my support for tailoring as merely setting up a straw man; surely everyone agrees with tailoring in principle? On a superficial level, it is hard to argue with the principle that regulatory tailoring\u00e2\u0080\u0094matching regulation and supervision to risk\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a prudent approach for bank regulators. And yet the rhetoric supporting tailoring and risk-based supervision often does not match regulatory reform efforts or supervisory approaches. The criticisms rarely manifest as skepticism of the principle itself. Rather, they are implicit in the approach to regulation and supervisory guidance or are disguised as a criticism of the\nexecution\nof tailoring.\nBoth the pending capital reform proposals and the final climate guidance illustrate how regulatory actions can deviate from the principle of tailoring without any express recognition of this effect.\nThe federal banking agencies have proposed several reforms to the capital framework, among them the Basel III \"endgame\" and new long-term debt requirements that would apply to all banks with over $100 billion in assets. I have expressed concern with both of these proposals on the merits, in terms of striking the right balance between safety and soundness and efficiency and fairness, and out of concern for potential unintended consequences. Another concern is whether these proposals show fidelity to the law, which requires regulatory tailoring above the $100 billion asset threshold. In 2019, the Board published its regulatory tailoring rule and included a\ncompelling visual (PDF)\nthat depicts in table form how a series of requirements\u00e2\u0080\u0094capital, single counterparty credit limits, liquidity, and the requirement to form a U.S. Intermediate Holding Company for foreign banking organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0094worked collectively to establish a tiered framework.\n4\nIf you superimpose the pending capital reform proposals on the table, there is a \"flattening\" of requirements in the capital bucket. Of course, this simple exercise does not reflect the unknown end state of the bank regulatory framework, and the current desire among some policymakers to modify liquidity requirements. These individual efforts highlight the hazard of piecemeal reforms, especially those that are closely related in their end-state operation, like capital and long-term debt requirements. When regulators pursue reforms by creating separate rulemaking silos, we limit our capacity to not only ensure fidelity to tailoring but also fidelity to our prudential mandates. Even when proposals have concurrent comment periods, the danger is that the final regulations will be miscalibrated and not appropriately tailored.\nTailoring underpins not only effective regulation, but also effective bank supervision. The effectiveness of the interagency principles used by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for the management of climate-related financial risks could be evaluated as a supervisory tool through the lens of tailoring, which requires us to consider both the regulatory threshold for applicability and the content of the guidance.\n5\nOne approach to evaluate the merit and effectiveness of these principles as a supervisory tool is through the lens of tailoring, which requires us to consider both the regulatory threshold for applicability and the content of the guidance.\nOn its face, it applies to banks with $100 billion or more in consolidated assets. What does this threshold mean in practice? Guidance serves the role of illuminating supervisory priorities and expectations. These informal communications help bridge the divide between regulators and regulated entities. When guidance notes that \"all financial institutions,\nregardless of size\n, may have material exposures to climate-related financial risks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6,\"\n6\nmy intuition is that banks will take little comfort from the nominal carveout in light of this language. Apart from the general concern with the \"cliff effect\" threshold at $100 billion, I question whether any size threshold will apply in practice.\n7\nThe content of the guidance\u00e2\u0080\u0094and its expectations for larger banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094suggests that the motivation behind the principles is neither prudential considerations nor to further regulatory tailoring, as it has a somewhat tenuous connection to core safety and soundness considerations and seems destined to trickle down to smaller firms over time. Banks have long been exposed to climate- and weather-related financial risks and have long been required to manage all of their material risks, including these. But the principles seem oriented toward contributing to a policy matter that extends well beyond prudential bank regulation\u00e2\u0080\u0094namely how the U.S. and other governments around the world should address climate change. And the principles seem focused on highly uncertain risks well outside the normal temporal horizon of a bank supervisor. One could reasonably ask, do the principles result in appropriate, risk-based prioritization of supervisory concerns? It is possible that they prioritize risks that may not be the most relevant for safety and soundness and may effectively influence credit allocation decisions through regulations that are not driven primarily by prudential considerations.\nBank regulators can acknowledge the importance of questions around climate change while also hewing to their statutory responsibilities. Promoting safety and soundness and U.S. financial stability is a weighty enough task without taking on other causes.\nThe current regulatory agenda includes many other examples where similar arguments can be made that regulatory reform proposals lack sufficient attention to regulatory tailoring and thereby fail to further statutory directives to tailor certain requirements and, more importantly, to address the condition of the banking system.\nApart from substantive deviations from regulatory tailoring, there are also indirect attacks on the value of tailoring as a principle to guide bank regulatory reforms. For example, one prominent argument raised shortly after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, and which has become a driving force in regulatory reform efforts, is that the Board's\napproach\nto tailoring was to blame for the bank failures and broader banking stress.\n8\nThe argument is that a major factor contributing to the bank failures was the implementation of S. 2155, the statutory mandate to tailor regulation and an accompanying shift in supervisory policy.\nAs I have noted many times in the past, I find little evidence to support this claim. While couched as a critique of the\nexecution\nof tailoring, this argument also seems to challenge the\nvalue\nof tailoring, asserting that a simple solution would be to unwind regulatory tailoring and eliminate risk-based tailoring in supervision. Taking ownership and accountability of the supervisory issues that significantly contributed to the banking system stress last spring enables us to look critically at the approach to regulation and supervision in the lead-up to these failures, and appropriately address the shortcomings.\nWhy Does Tailoring Matter?\nBefore thinking about tailoring for smaller, simpler firms, I think it's helpful to think about the largest, most complex firms. Additional regulation and heightened supervisory attention are warranted and necessary for larger firms, particularly global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with additional size, risk, and complexity. This principle is so well-established that it was not only a core precept of S. 2155, it was a central theme of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n9\nWe need not rely on past views about the virtue of tailoring\u00e2\u0080\u0094what was once conventional wisdom\u00e2\u0080\u0094to believe in its ongoing relevance.\nOne critique of tailoring may be with what underlying \"problem\" it is designed to solve, particularly as it relates to the allocation of finite resources both for banks and for regulators. Are regulatory and supervisory resources actually limited, and if so, what are the practical constraints on these resources? At a basic level, the quantum of regulatory and supervisory resources is a policy decision\u00e2\u0080\u0094as regulatory and supervisory demands grow, so too can the staffs and budgets of the federal banking agencies. The U.S. financial system is expansive and regulators have the capacity to expand supervisory resources as needed (or as perceived) to address safety and soundness concerns.\nOf course, there are practical constraints on an ever-expanding and stricter bank regulatory framework. First, the funding of regulatory and supervisory expansion imposes costs not only on U.S. taxpayers but also on banks, and indirectly, bank customers. While the banking system has many advantages\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the use of insured deposits as a source of financing banking activities\u00e2\u0080\u0094at some point, this structural advantage will erode under the cumulative burden of the regulatory framework and will result in a shift of activities from banks to nonbanks and the broader shadow-banking system. The contours of the financial system, where products and services are offered, does not exist according to the bright line of federal regulatory authority. We would be well served to recognize the limitations of a regulatory perimeter that pushes activity outside of the banking system and beyond this authority.\nUnintended Consequences\nAs we consider the merits of tailoring, we should consider the consequences of not adhering to this principle in regulation and supervision, and related reform proposals.\nAs a threshold matter, a bank regulatory approach that disregards tailoring can manifest in different ways, such as uniformity in approach\u00e2\u0080\u0094failing to differentiate among institutions based on their size, risk, and complexity\u00e2\u0080\u0094or by adopting regulatory \"cliffs\" clustered around thresholds that insufficiently distinguish among institutions based on these factors. In both cases, deviating from tailoring could result in fundamental changes to the structure of the U.S. banking system.\nOne risk of uniform requirements is the consolidation pressure it creates. Apart from the shortcomings I've discussed in appropriate risk-based prioritization within the bank regulatory framework, this approach encourages consolidation, as institutions seek operational economies of scale to gain competitive advantage over their peers. In this scenario, the benefits of being large, risky, and complex become a driving force in the organization of the banking industry. I think we should consider the implications not only for regulatory efficiency, but also whether this approach represents waving the white flag in fighting against the assertion that certain institutions are \"too big to fail.\"\nEven where standards are not uniform, a lack of sufficient tailoring can reshape the banking industry, simply through the cliff effects created around particular regulatory thresholds. For example, capital reform and climate regulation would establish $100 billion as the key regulatory threshold, lending additional gravity to the decision to cross, or even approach it, with the consequence of reducing the number of institutions around that threshold. Institutions\nabove\nthe threshold will face strong incentives to grow larger to achieve economies of scale. Institutions\nbelow\nthe threshold will face strong incentives to manage their size to avoid the significant ",
